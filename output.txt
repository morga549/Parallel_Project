1 This creates a very interesting situation for hockey.  The NHL is already pulled out of the Winter Olympics.  The KHL might pull out in response to this too, which would further lower the level of players participating in the tournament.
1 Thanks to [Grigory Rodchenkov's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Rodchenkov?wprov=sfla1) testimony and his journal, this massive scandal came to light. Even though he shaped the Russian doping program himself, he risked and still risks his life to make it public. He deserves massive respect from all sides.The IOC's measures have previously been laughable. Rodchenkov's journal left them no chance but to ban Russia. 
1 This is unprecedented in size. Hopefully we will look back and see this is a turning point into taking doping seriously and cracking down.
1 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment."So they will boycott something they aren't invited to?
1 Good. Their blatant cheating in Sochi needed to be punished.Everyone should watch the “Icarus” documentary.
1 Real sick of Putin at this moment.For the past few years, what positive thing has he accomplished for Russia or for the world? He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.
1 Watched "Icarus" on Netflix two nights ago. This is about the shadiest thing I've ever seen in sports: State sponsored doping for athletes. After watching the documentary, I was surprised that the IOC allowed Russia to participate in Rio. If you haven't seen "Icarus" I highly recommend it.
1 Highly, highly recommend the documentary *Icarus* on Netflix. It's all about this and it's my favorite doc of the year thus far.
166 Good. 
1 Really happy the athletes that are clean and didn't cheat still get to compete!
1 So what you're saying is, Russia cheats.Surprise surprise.
1 I hate it for the clean ones who dedicated their lives to this moment but I support the ban!!!     
1 Wow, I knew that the doping was a huge problem, but I'm shocked the IOC actually will go this far to punish Russia. Especially since Russia paid them millions for the 2014 Olympics. Gotta feel awful for the athletes that want to represent their country. Most didn't even know they were getting doped by their coaches, but they'll they get punished for their stupidity. 
1 Wow I also sort of hadn't really processed that the olympics were in South Korea this year.   That's gonna be a tense couple of weeks.  Odds on Putin trying to throw matches on the political climate to get the games canceled? 
1 Now who is Trump going to root for?
1 *In an elaborate overnight operation at the 2014 Sochi Games, a team assembled by Russia’s sports ministry tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition. More than two dozen Russian athletes have been disqualified from the Sochi standings as a result, and Olympic officials are still sorting through the tainted results and rescinding medals.*They were using steroids *during* the Olympics.
1 Jesus Fucking Christ, they didn't even ban the goddamn *Nazis* from the Olympics.That's gotta' sting.Also, how fucking pathetic do you have to be to cheat at the Olympics? Like, there's no *real* prize at the end. You know that, right? It's not like the Olympics people give you a hundred GDPs for winning.
1 UPDATE: President Trump has asked President Putin if any of the athletes doped, Putin has denied it, and President Trump believes him.  President Trump is now curious when the IOC will begin investigating Hillary Clinton for doping.  
1 Apparently,  the IOC is tougher on Russia for its transgressions in sports than the US government is for Russia’s inference with its democracy.
1 Good.  China are also legendary dopers and should be banned.
1 *Putin bots incoming*
1 Great to see cheaters actually being punished by the Olympics. I know everyone thinks the IOC is corrupt, and they probably are, but this is a great move to make sports more legitimate competition. 
1 Canada's time to shine!
1 IOC: Russia will not be allowed to compete in 2018. Putin: We could go if we wanted, we're just BOYCOTTING the games.
1 GET FUCKED VLAD
1 [deleted]
1 There should be a small steroid and drug section to the Olympics where we see athletes high on tons of chemicals doing inhuman things. Like web-slinging.
1 Finally someone sanctioned Russia on something they cheated or meddled with ;) 
1 Well I guess Ovechkin doesn't have to worry about playing in the Olympics anymore this year
1 > Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that Russia won zero medals.I can't imagine Putin letting any Russian athletes do this.
1 Sad day for Putin. He cheats and lies and tries so hard to "Make Russia Great Again" after being smacked around in the cold war (I raise only because based on most biographical accounts I've read, he still harbors resentment), and now we see all this mess being peeled back and the reputation of Russia only worsening on the world stage. Guy needs a wake-up call, but he's a paranoid megalomaniac, so unlikely.But hey, yet again, Russia denies it. From denying intrusion on various nations' election systems, denying troops in Ukraine, denying their missiles blowing up a civilian airliner, denying doping—Denialism is so heavy in Russia, one wonders if Russian leadership are a bunch of scared little cowards too afraid of being upfront with their own actions. **Why is Putin such a coward?**
1 Sneaky fucking Russians 
1 incoming tweet from trump denouncing that very unfair treatment
1 Awww. It's so much fun watching Team Canada's hockey team beat them in any round really. I'm going to miss that now.
1 Calling it now Russia will be in the 2018 Winter Olympics 
1 Suck it Russia!!! In all seriousness. If the integrity of physical sports is gonna last we NEED to have better human beings playing them.
1 I've asked Vladimir Putin about the Doping.He says that it didn't happen.I believe him.
1 Expecting Russian support of North Korean nuclear and missile program during the Olympics because of massive butthurt.
1 Eat shit Russia
1 The Olympics, the World Cup, foreign elections, their own economy... Is there anything Russia hasn't tried to corrupt?
1 Is it me or does Russia have a national 'cheat at everything' mindset?
1 Russia has become a festering sore on planet earth in the past 5 years, hasn't it?
1 But who is Trump gonna root for now?
1 Get fucked Russia 
1 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment."You can't fire me, I quit!
1 I highly recommend ‘Icarus’ on Netflix. Such a good documentary about unearthing the whole thing. Amazing watch
1 Huh. Participants in a contest get punished for cheating to win said contest. Even if it is difficult to determine the effect cheating had on winning that contest.I see absolutely no parallels between this and the current presidential situation in the United States today. None whatsoever.
1 Everyone should watch the documentary Icarus. One of Russia's biggest whistleblowers(and a courageous man) is currently living in the US under witness protection. He is the mastermind behind the Russian doping scandal and came clean. If you want to understand the details of how deep their operation is watch the documentary.Oh, and by the way the head of the Olympic doping agency for the US estimates that 50% of US Olympic athletes are doping illegally. 
1 Fuck, I mean, I know we deserved this shit entirely (state sponsored cheating is state sponsored cheating, no way around it) but a Winter Olympics without Russia feels so hollow. Perhaps more concerning is that Putin will DEFINITELY use this as a propaganda tool, furthering "The West is out to get us!" narrative
1 Disgusting cheating Russian POS
1 This is crazy! Russians totally dominate ladies' figure skating right now. Their national competition is so interesting to watch since so many girls who could be national champion in America get left behind since everyone there just that good. It will be interesting to see everyone's reaction to this. 
1 Trump is about to make fun of the Olympics.
1 The Russians attempting to cheat?  No way
1 And they are still allowed to host the world Cup. This is just amazing....
1 good riddance 
1 I feel really bad for those athletes in Russia who DIDN'T dope.All that work for nothing.  Sorry comrade.
1 First it’s our news the cheat on and now it’s worlds sports! What’s next?!
1 Haha. Fuck you putin
1 Oh well, they'll probably compete under the Olympic flag and celebrate every medal as a russian victory.
1 [removed]
1 Aww. Now who will Canada beat for hockey gold? USA or Sweden?
1 Has anyone put /r/the_donald on suicide watch?
1 cyka blyat
1 Jesus Christ Russia, get your shit together.
1 Russia should have their own Olympics and embrace doping.  I certainly don't care what someone else does for money and there are so many athletes cheating anyway.  
1 Serves them right 
1 America elected Donald Trump as president.Does that not disqualify the USA for doping too?
1 Alright I'm just curious here. How does doping help someone in a glorified sled go faster?Edit: Since this is already getting down voted I feel the need to say I am not supporting Russia at all, I was just genuinely curious. I am THRILLED they were banned as I don't think they should even have been allowed to compete at Rio in any capacity. I want to see elite athletes perform at the limit of the human body-- the true limit, not an artificial, drug created one.
1 Bout f’n time.
1 This is completely unprecedented.Some athletes will still be allowed to go, they will just have to not use the Russian Flag.I'm glad they're not punishing the athletes, this isn't their fault.I kind of feel bad for the athletes that were pressured into doping too. 
1 *opens popcorn* 🍿Oh don't mind me , just waiting for Trump supporters to defend Russia.
1 The use of a label to hide the title is really inappropriate 
1 Ought to make Hockey more interesting
1 Here we go. Buckle up.
1 Is this for all of their teams? or is it targeted?
1 Eh, I'll believe it when I see it. I'd be willing to put a few bucks on seeing Russia there on opening night. This is just the IOC showing off that they're 'serious' about doping, but they know the winter Oylmpics are already in trouble and keeping the Russians out will only make things worse. 
1 And they're hosting the World Cup in 2018, yikes
1 Good. Russia needs to recognize that while there are no laws, per se, governing the international community, there can certainly be backlash for consistent bullshit behavior. This even applies when you're a country with an incredible arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
1 Good. Cheaters in the Olympics should be banned for life and nations that cheat systematically must be penalized. I'm glad to see that athletes who can prove they are clean can still compete.
1 As expected. If Russia said they would stop then they would be admitting guilt!
1 Russia's national slogan should be if you ain't cheatin' you ain't trying. These fuckers are trying to leverage themselves in every facet. 
1 >Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniformBeige wins the gold[?](http://i.imgur.com/SWrTZEa.gifv)
1 The power of Icarus
1 Russia?   Criminals?  Yeah right.
1 What does this do to Krusty Burger's gold-medal free burger promotion?
1 Well that was fast.
1 Wow, I just watched the documentary Icarus last night. Very timely.
1 Check out "Icarus" on Netflix, it details many of the things in the report and is an outstanding documentary. I'm not saying that all Olympic athletes are clean but Russia had it coming this time.
1 This again?  Didn’t we just do this 2 years ago and they were ultimately still allowed to participate?
1 Eat a dick Putin
1 Oh wow, they actually did it....wtf Russia
1 In Russia, sports ban YOU!
1 This was the only thing stopping Team GB from Winter Olympic dominance. NOW WE WILL RULE THE WA...SNOW? AGAIN
1 So much for Ovechkin running off.
1 so when they said this year was going to be 1984... i did not think of Los Angeles 1984
1 Git fukt.
1 damn.... this is unprecedented for the IOC, which has always been accused of taking bribes in exchange for meting out slaps on the wrist. I think the entire Olympic movement has been cast under a shadow of doping & chemical enhancement, deservedly so. 
1 wut bout murican roids?
1 all of Russian players are banned?
1 Can the IOC ban Russia from future US elections too?
1 The IOC is one of the most corrupt organizations on the planet, it is drastic need of reform.
1 How much of this was the government and how much was the athletes themselves? Like, how coerced were they to do this? Could you just refuse? It would suck if you were an athlete who didn’t dope but you didn’t get to go to the olympics in your prime because everyone else fucked it up for you.
1 tl;dr, Russia used steroids
1 They were just too dope. 
1 [Netflix Documentary Icarus Trailer](https://youtu.be/qXoRdSTrR-4)Highly recommend this documentary on Netflix outlining the doping scandal in Russia. It gets really good when it gets dark.
1 The allowed athletes from Russia can borrow the neutral, unidentifying uniforms that Russia used when they invaded Ukraine to compete in.
1 I will break you.  
1 Over/under Trump pulls our athletes as a protest?
1 cyka blyat
1 Netflix has a good documentary on the doping of sports. [Icarus](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079). It isn't limited to Russia, in fact, almost all high-level athletes dope.
1 That's cold...
1 Lolz at Russia
1 Git gud
1 That’s dope 
1 Putin doesn't believe the rules apply to himself.
1 Russia is just a mafia state. They couldn't do anything honestly if they tried.
1 Wait, like, the entire country's team is banned, not just one sport? This is huge.
1 This is dumb. "Doping" should be not only allowed, but encouraged. Exercise is just as "artificial" as performance enhancing drugs are; why shouldn't people be allowed to do whatever they want to reach peak performance? If it were allowed, it could massively push research into human improvement forward. It's not even like people are on an even footing without doping; not having it just puts the difference onto winning the genetic lottery.It could alternatively be handled like glitches in speedruns, where you have a separate category for baseline humans (akin to the glitchless category of speedruns), but where the main category (usually) is the one where people are allowed to actually try. But the variant where doping is allowed should always be the main one, as this provides incentive into research into improving mankind.
1 Who will Trump root for now?
1 Man, they really love influencing any event for their own gain. 
1 What are the odds that Trump comes out tweeting about how the “failing IOC won’t let Russia compete! Sad!” ?
1 So? They still compete anyway..
1 Sadulaev lost to Snyder both in and out of season
1 So they are able to "rig" the US election to put a puppet in office but cant get away with doping in a corrupt Olympics?  Sure.  
1 I reckon a drug olympics would be way better... viagra sponsors the relay race.. speed the 100 meters  big pharma could finally come out of the shadows  image everyone doped up  be amazing instead of all this guessing and by now the guy testing the piss must be yellowed off
1 But the athletes are still allowed to play?
1 Sigh
1 I can’t wait for the Trump meltdown over this.
1 Get cyka'd you blyats. 
1 Aww yeah bitchezzz! Putin is crying right now.
1 Oh great, now Trump is gonna boycott the Olympics in solidarity with his puppetmaster. 
1 In Soviet Russia, Olympics boycott *you!*
1 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott "The old "You can't fire me , I QUIT!" routine.
1 Oooo putin is about kill some mo'
1 Classic Russia  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1 Trump: Olympics are fake sports. As one of the best, best althetes I know this. US will not compete.
1 Can someone explain to me why everything that touches Russia is some kind of sketchy?
1 This is absolutely nuts! If you have the time watch the documentary on Netflix titled Icarus. It will blow your mind the hoops they went through to dope their athletes.
1 Again?
1 Like all of Russia?
1 I didn't know making a dope our president had an official name.
1 State backed doping program huh? Russia was going to humiliate the west with these games but instead they got smacked down hard. Poor Russia they cant catch a break this year. 
1 This is pretty huge news. This isn't some small country, it's a world superpower.
1 this can kickstart the steroids olympics where everyone is on gear all the time 
1 How much of this was the government and how much was the athletes themselves? Like, how coerced were they to do this? Could you just refuse? It would suck if you were an athlete who didn’t dope but you didn’t get to go to the olympics in your prime because everyone else fucked it up for you.
1 I thought there was a typo in the title and thought "what sport"? And then it clicked
1 Shocker 
1 Vladimir Putin cheat? Shocking!
1 The Icarus effect. 
1 Russia banned **again** for doping **again**
1 I feel bad for all the athletes who didnt cheat. 
1 Trump will probably respond by boycotting the olympics to support his buddy.
1 I wonder which criteria will the IOC take to consider Russian athletes to compete under the IOC banner, besides of a verifiable record of being clean of doping substances.
1 I think it's a good call to punish the officials and still give the geniunely hardworking Russian athletes a chance to compete 
1 [Would totally recommend this documentary about the Russain doping scandals thoughout the Olympics.](http://www.Check.com/ out "Icarus" on Netflixwww.netflix.com/title/80168079?source=android)
1 For a second I thought you meant the football cup, which takes place in Russia
1 In Mother Russia, steroids take you.
1 Russia: the worlds mafia
1 so Rocky IV really was telling the truth
1 Damn commies 
1 Didn't they do this also for the last Olympics, but then end up allowing them like 2 weeks before it started?
1 I feel like they're still going to show up
1 Can't wait til the story breaks that Nike has been doping it's sponsored athletes
1 Damn Somebody messed up
1 Does drinking vodka do give them any sort of advantage though
1 WE WILL CREATE SUPER ATHLETE! 
1 The clean Russians need to go out in full force not boycott and dominate. It's the only way to preserve their honor. 
1 See [Icarus](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079)
1 I wish we had XTREME OLYMPICS where everyone was doping with the best performance enhancers, that would be far more entertaining imo.
1 and then the Russian athletes will still march in bearing their flag and win more medals than the USA
1 Seems like the PR department for *Icarus* showed up. There's no less than 100 comments mentioning how people should watch the documentary. 
1 This isn't very surprising. 
1 Great. I'm still salty over that 2014 Winter Olympic figure skating bias judging
1 They tested positive for Trump. The worst kind of dope in Russia. 
1 Is there any way in which Russia *isn't* a massive piece of shit?
1 This is big new. Huge news. Maybe the biggest in a long time.
1 Just at the same time as funnily enough Russia got an amazing group for their football 2018 World Cup...
1 Dope
1 lul
1 Don't really understand the whole issue with doping; personally I want to see the most freakishly enhanced mutant super athletes imaginable. 
1 Too bad we can't ban them from the 2020 elections.
1 And the other countries? 
1 damn, russia, you break all the rules
1 Now I'm afraid that because of National pride, those who allowed to compete and will chose to do so may be labeled as some sort of traitors.And not even by news organisations, but by the people.BTW our State channels announced they won't be broadcasting the Olympics.
1 Russia and Scientology getting shit on. Today was a good day.
1 Too bad the Russian people have to be humiliated for the corruption of their governing bodies/ Oligarchs.  I wish we could offer them a carrot or Olive Branch somehow, before things get unrepairable, but the aforesaid make that difficult.      
1 Not for doping. For getting *caught* doping. I assure you, more teams are guilty.
1 Countdown to Trump declaring war on the Olympics.
1 Fuck the Russians. They've been doing this shit forever.
1 Just close it down for 10 years or so
1 Well, at least they're in the World Cup next year. No one ever cheats at football. Never. 
1 Yeah, doping athletes isn’t the best choice to make when trying to compete in Winter Olympics...
1 Russian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral competitors though. 
1 So you can't dope to get an edge, but you can send men posing as women to compete against women? Adds up... 
1 So this is punishment for their doping scheme in 2014?  That seems unfair.  Have the Russians been caught cheating again recently, or did I miss something?  
1 They'll be too busy with the US mid-term elections anyway. 
1 Now who is Trump supposed to root for?
1 Trump is going to condemn this on Twitter tomorrow. 
1 “There were bad people on both sides”. -Probably Trump 
1 Will Russia allow the U.S. to compete?
1 Putin is not going to be happy about this. 
1 Well deserved. Doesn't matter if you're hosting the Olympics or not, giving your athletes an unfair advantage over those of other countries is never fair.
1 Woah that's huge!
1 Need to move indoor volleyball to the winter games
1 Maybe Russia will win TIME’s Person of the Year.Dope.
1 So basically a political move instead of an ethical one because we all know it's not only Russia's representatives who dope.
1 Putin will not be pleased
1 Im sure russia will get donny to pull a few strings. 
1 Everyone at the Olympics dopes, I guess they want to reduce the viewership of the event by banning Russia.
1 But they can still hold the World Cup, huh?
1 Вы все знаете кого благодарить! 
1 I guess we'll see a lot of people with tracksuits then.
1 Honestly, i think it probably has more to do with politics. Williams sisters were given permission to use banned substances yet Sharapova was crucified for sonething that was just recently banned.With the amount of money athletes make, I don't blame them one bit. I did little semi unethical things at times to keep my job too when I was younger.
1 Russia dopes to win meanwhile liberals want biological men to be able to compete against women for easy medals.
1 And the US has no history of dopers? Hypocrisy is thy name. 
1 Here comes the least popular Winter Olympics in years.
1 When you're too cool to take part in some nerd game, like chill dudes i know I'm dope but you can't kick me out over it😎
1 So they still get to compete, just as "Olympic Athletes from Russia." So how is this a ban? 
1 Politics pushing it's way into sports... when the Olympics are meant to unite people. How can anyone see this bullshit ruling against a whole team as remotely fair? It's like banning any american from bike races because of Armstrong...
1 Great. Olympic games are a big waste of taxpayers' money and a source of corruption. Can we make this ban permanent please?
1 Canada Hockey Team wins gold! DONE.
1 I read elsewhere that they will compete with neutral uniforms. So in essence, they are still allowing Russia to compete.
1 This is as surprising as pretty much anything Trump says now a days.
1 Good. Fucking cheaters.
1 Find it hard to believe Russia is the only country engaging in doping. Seems like they were just the first to be caught.
1 So, no Russian figure skaters? Big break for the other teams. My Russian-American wife will be sad though.I'll be interested to hear her opinion on this matter, I doubt she knows anything about this yet.
1 Good. Fuck Russia and Russians.
1 Western lies! Russia has no doping! Only superior athletes! /s
1 We already knew Russians are dopes
1 I don't see what the big deal is. Let them use whatever substances they want. It's not like it makes them "superhuman." My dad always taught me work smart, not hard.
1 Now if only we could end this charade called the Olympics all together.
1 Wake up sheeple!!!! Russia isn't the only country that does this
1 I didn't know weed was a performance enhancer

1 Aside from Hockey I’m kind of interested in knowing what winter sports would greatly benefit from doping?  *Maybe* skating?  Cross country skiing?But for the most part:Skiing?  NopeSnowboarding?  NopeSledding?  NopeCurling?  Ahhhh-haaaaaa!
1 Why is the nhl pulled out of the Olympics?
1 I really hate that the NHL doesn't participate anymore. I totally get why, but those games were so fun to watch 
1 Will be the worst Olympic hockey tournament ever no doubt. Nobody will take it seriously.
1 Are any hockey fans even looking forward to the olympics this year?Personally I stopped caring as soon as the NHL pulled out, I feel like if it's not going to be some version of "the best" competing then it probably shouldn't be included in the olympics.
1 You'd have to go down to the middle school level for Canadians to not be fun to watch. Shame they'll have no Russians to play against though. I wonder if the silver will go to USA or a Scandinavian country.
1 The KHL already said they would pull out if this happened. They are probably going to leave the IIHF because of this. Pretty much means no players from the KHL can compete.
1 The KHL is not allowed to stop its players from going, they have an agreement with the IIHF (which the NHL does not). They would face some serious repercussions if that happened
1 ...which is such a shame. Hockey is by far my favorite part of the Winter Olympics. I wish all the best NHL and KHL players would be able to play.
1 > This creates a very interesting situation for hockey.   Don't tell me you believe the Miracle of Ice had nothing to do with PEDs
1 Who the fuck is Canada going to compete against now?
1 Where were you when Ethiopia won the 2018 gold medal in men's ice hockey??
1 So what your saying is that it's my time to get a medal?
1 Well to be fair, the world juniors are a lot of fun to watch so I'm not too worried. 
1 So it will return to a competition for amateur athletes as it was originally. 
1 Let's make a team! I can finally be an Olympian!
1 Now it's Jamaica's chance to shine!
1 JAMAICA WE GOT A HOCKEY TEAM!
1 The KHL has already said no to the Olympics
1 Professional players shouldn’t be playing in the Olympics if it interrupts their season. Let’s go back to the days when college players played, maybe some semi pros too. 
1 That would actually make it really interesting, instead of millionaires playing it would be mostly good amateurs(CHL and NCAA) and pro's from smaller(comparatively) leagues like the Swiss, Finnish and Swedish leagues. I'd watch it.
1 Hey... maybe we can get the Olympics back to covering non-professional sport!  Unlikely, but it's possible.
1 It's nice to see a whistleblower actually vindicated. Also the Netflix documentary Icarus lays out the story really well for anyone who wants to know more.
1 What a great guy. Russia doesn't respond well to anti-Russian whistleblowers. I wish him the best.
1 Guy rolled the dice of his future for the truth, admirable.
1 At least two of his colleagues at the agency died suddenly too, which is what led him and some of his co-workers to flee the country. It sounds like quite a few people sacrificed a lot to bring this to light
1 Is he in hiding still?  I think he left his family back in Russia.  Sad.
1 He should avoid night-time strolls on well-lit streets next to the Kremlin that have cameras conveniently turned off.
1 Reading that wikipedia page when all of the sudden: "“empirical evidence is totally to the contrary,” IOC member **Dick Pound** "
1 It should also be noted that this guy had to leave his family back in Russia. He entered Witness Protection in the states and due to that will likely never see or hear from his family ever again.
1 For those who don't know he is in witness protection at the moment because of the threat against his life.Others have already been killed. Watch Icarus on netflix. Amazing documentary. 
1 It blows my mind that someone's life could be at risk surrounding a series of snow themed games. 
1 The IOC is a joke. Everybody uses PEDs at the Olympic level. Just a matter of who gets caught.
1 Rodchenkov should be in jail by any account. If there was any doping system, it was created by him, for his own profit. He is a criminal, who should treated like one, and not praised.
1 His depiction in Icarus really made me see the sympathetic side of him. It's hard to see his story and not feel sorry for him.
1 > Even though he shaped the Russian doping program himself ...  he deserves massive respect from all sides.LOL
1 [deleted]
1 I wonder what would lead one to betray their country like that. If I were Russian I'd hate him too.
1 But they're still competing, just not under the Russian flag.
1 Unfortunately, Russian officials are already playing the propaganda game on this one. Even the official questioned in the article basically said, "ask not what Russia should do to fix this situation, the world should ask what they can do to help Russia." Which is *pompous, arrogant, and in line with their ongoing geo-political intent to lie, manipulate, cheat, and disrupt much of the Western world and parts of Asia as much as they can -- rather than growing up and acting as a responsible world partner. I don't see it stopping. If anything they will hire a team of scientists to come up with more sophisticated methods of cheating. 
1 Or just accepting it.
1 Why crack down? Before long gene doping will take place and be untraceable. How about we embrace doping and as some sports have done have a doping and a natural league...
1 If that’s not Putin it in perspective for Russia idk what will.
1 It may be as well an end to Olympics. I am in Russia and not a fan of big sport (Garfunkel and Oates nailed it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fraSdN-PG8) and I hope it will be the end of it for Russia. World championships aren't really that good from PR standpoint. We are banned from Olympics ( and I don't see neither Russia nor  MOC deescalating) so there is no point to put money into it ( in Russia Olympic level sportsmen are funded by government)I hope my government will start building more pools for common people instead of training few genetic freaks.
1 Its not like the Russian government lying and cheating at fucking everything is a new occurrence. It's the one constant in the land of beets. I mean, that and beets.
1 Wasn't Russia banned before?
1 Like the 70s. Or the 80s. Or 90s. Or lance Armstrong....i give up dope for everyone.
1 I'll make my own olympics! With blackjack, and polonium!
1 Did they learn from Donny or vice-versa?
1 flawless logic
1 "You can't ban us if we just don't go!"
1 You can't fire me if I quit.
1 "our country wasn't going anyways" 
1 Maybe for future Olympic Games?
1 It's almost like inviting Steph Curry to come visit you and then, after he says "nah," rescinding his invitation.
1 The should also watch rocky 4. The Russian dude cheated god dammit! 
1 I just watched this last night! Very timely viewing.
1 Yeah. And some of the judges clearly favored Russian athletes.
1 Don't pretty much all olympic athletes dope? I always thought the special part about Russia was that it's state funded.
1 Literally EVERYONE
1 Russia has a huge cheating problem as a nation.Lots of bribery, corruption, cheating in the olympics, they even cheat disproportionately often on video games. About 1200% more than most other nations.
1 But they're still competing.
1 He's trying to keep Russia relevant on the world stage with a weak hand.  He has sorta accomplished this, tho he has also made Russia even more weak, but hey, we're talking about them, so win?
1 Hopefully this is the beginning of his end. 
1 Psh. It started with Yeltsins "economic shock therapy" when converting to capitalism in the early 90s. Immediately the wealth was distributed to the oligarchs and the corruption was all she wrote. After he dissolved the parliament, smashed the uprising, scrapped the constitution, and banned political opposition - he resigned and named his Prime Minister as his successor. A Mr. Vladimir Putin. Anyway the point is, this isn't new. It's been a feature of Russia's government since the Soviet Union dissolved. There's never been a time it wasn't like this, unfortunately. 
1 If this is what they do when it comes to something as trivial as a sports competition imagine the resources and tactics Putin uses in influencing national elections, international relations etc...
1 I don't get it. You can do good for the people and *still* be the richest, most powerful individual there is.
1 Yeah, 90s-era Russia was some world power...
1 Is he personally liable for any wrongdoing here?
1 It's absolutely delicious how oblivious Redditors can be to basic world politics and events in these default subs.And given the obliviousness, I'm not talking about everyone else.
1 I feel like as long as Russia shows some military power, Russians will vote for Putin.
1 He's done a lot for shirtless dad bod. 
1 I mean, to be completely honest he's the reason that the Russian Federation is even world power still. Not that I'm defending the guy, he's a real piece of shit, but you have to give credit where it's due.
1 Didn't he de-arm a shit ton of nukes? In line with some international agreement.
1 I am glad that something is being done against Putin, even if its not yet in the sphere of election rigging
1 He has done so many good things. You just get the good informations filtered out in your english news bubble. And you actually believe it. No wonder trump won.
1 Not to mention he's turning the country into an Orthodox theocracy with a boot on the neck of any religion the patriarch of Moscow doesn't like. 
1 He turned Russia into a world power after a 70 year communist dictatorship. 
1 He ended the war in Syria. That's pretty big
1 This is crazy. I legit just finished Icarus not 5 minutes ago and then I jump on Reddit and see this. At the end, they threw up all the stats and said as of now, Russia will be competing in future Olympic events. That of course pissed me right off, but this just gave me immediate satisfaction. The other side of the story though is that this is a systematic issue. The methods in place to prevent doping are hardly effective due to the disconnection between those who are policing the athletes and the Olympic organization themselves who are just as corrupt as the Russian government.
1 > This is about the shadiest thing I've ever seen in sports: State sponsored doping for athletes.   *ahem* Miracle on Ice
1 I wonder how much that documentary weighed into this decision.
1 They deserve a good bitchslap. They're a mafia state. This will infuriate Putin, have no doubt about it, he was going to take not being able to use their flag as a "humiliation." After 27 Russians were caught cheating why should they *not* be banned. Good indeed.
1 Agreed. 
1 Dope.
1 Proven clean athletes will still get to compete under neutral uniform and flag. If they win a gold, the ceremony will raise an Olympics flag and play the Olympics anthem.
1 please be sarcasm
1 Yeah this concentrates the punishment on Russia, and those athletes that cheated, while enabling clean athletes to participate.  A good compromise all around.
1 But what about team sports. Will there be an Russia hockey team under Olympic flag?
1 Russia, Republicans, Give me the D instead
1 Damn nothing really to respect about their country now sadly. 
1 They can still compete. Proven athletes can go under a neutral flag
1 There's still an opening for some Russian athletes to compete with a neutral flag.That is, if Putin lets them and doesn't try to boycott or something.
1 i don't understand why you would tho.... allow the clean ones to participate... and the doped ones not too... banning a country is fucking stupid imo.
1 Billions, soshi cost $55b 
1 Like the US isn't as well?EDIT: I'm not saying the USA has systemic doping the level of Russia did in Sochi - I'm just saying they definitely have doping at a high level with lots and lots of people involved to make sure their athletes test clean.
1 Literally every Olympic athlete is on gear. 
1 Go watch Icarus. They state how every country dopes. Russia was caught and had a whistleblower that's it. I'm personally Russian and agree with the decision as much as it sucks, but just cause they're the only ones banned doesn't mean others shouldn't be
1 If you see anyone defending Russia they are a Putin bot. Russia is evil and scary and we want war with them! Reds under the bed!
1 Did it reach the front page of T_ D yet? They must be upset 
1 Будь что будет! 
1 Actually being punished?  They have increased testing from 700 tests in Salt Lake City to 1219 tests in Turin to 2149 in Vancouver to 2453 in Sochi.  Nearly all of the failed tests resulted in sanctions.  Russia has had over 100 athletes (more than any other country) who failed tests and all but one has resulted in sanctions.  Looks like they are stepping up their efforts and they do punish failed tests.  Not sure what "actually" is supposed to mean in this case. 
1 No kidding! Those medal standings are going to be embarrassing for everyone else.
1 GET IMPALED VLAD!ftfy
1 They can probably go as an independent athlete.
1 If it helps, no matter what happened Putin would have used it as a propaganda tool.
1 You're aware that almost every country has dopers (Cheaters) and the only reason Russia is being banned here is that [they had a Whistleblower](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079)... Remember folks, take 5 minutes of your time to actually formulate a response instead of gut biases.
1 > Russians totally dominate ladies' figure skating right now.Yes, well, they cheat...
1 They'll still go. No Russia in the team trophy though. I wonder how that will work. Russia qualified 3 women's skaters. 
1 It's ironic that the only reason that America's (and some others) ice skating and gymnastics programs got better was because of Soviet champions defecting or moving to America and coaching.
1 FIFA corruption amazing???
1 How is it related? The IOC does not run the World Cup. 
1 Probably has something to do with the fact that FIFA and IOC are not connected in any way
1 All four of them!
1 Gold won't mean anything with the shitty teams that are going to show up. No NHL players mean the level of skill is going to be so low compared to normal. 
1 Sweden vs Finland finals, calling it now. 
1 The NHL isn't allowing players to participate in the Olympics.So really it'll be a bunch of AHL players.
1 I'm interested to see what is going to happen with curling
1 Canada and the USA are going to be a disadvantage with the NHL not participating.  We might see countries like Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland actually being the top teams now, especially if the KHL pulls out too in response to this ban.
1 Canada wasn't winning anyways with no NHL players going. Russia was the huge favorite but not now.  Probably Sweden.
1 I just spit coffee on my keyboard asshole. 
1 Electing Trump was definitely *dopey*, but not *doping*.
1 > Alright I'm just curious here. How does doping help someone in a glorified sled go faster?If you're talking about bobsledding, a huge part of it is the initial push-off where they push the sled down the ramp before jumping in.  Having stronger legs is a huge advantage.  Same with luge and stronger arms.
1 It could help with concentration, focus, and strategy. That's part of the reason alcohol is banned as a performance-enhancing drug in shooting competitions. 
1 Bobsleigh athletes are all 100m sprinters,with a powerful push
1 Many bobsleigh members come from failed 100m sprinters. Which was already doping. 
1 Bobsledders are generally sprinters that have learned to sled. The start makes the most difference barring a major mistake during the driving stage. There's a long history of doping problems with sprinters in track.
1 You've received a few replies but not a single one has touched on arguably the biggest advantage to doping --- recovery times.You can train harder, faster, and longer. It's a HUGE issue in fighting. When a BJJ or MMA athlete that is doping is able to train three or four times a day and someone clean is only able to train twice a day you can see how quickly a skill gap can develop.
1 it's trump. he would just make them wear russian uniforms.
1 The article says athletes are allowed to complete as neutral non-country-affiliated athletes if they've submitted and passed all their drug tests
1 > I wish we could offer them a carrot or Olive Branch somehowThey are. Russian athletes can still compete just not under the Russian flag.
1 Then they were the dumbest of the dumb. 
1 So have Americans.
1 no one cares
1 They were dumb enough to pull that shit in Sochi. They're not a smart nation with their blatant corruption. Dumb fucks
1 no. it's an ethical one. please prove that other governments make their athletes cheat
1 Provide evidence and they will ban others. Please do not defend bad behavior by pretending everyome does it.
1 Provide evidence and they will ban more i am sure.
1 Yeah they totally want to reduce viewership. That makes so much sense.
1 Thank you Gravitas, for making sure we frame all LGBTQ discussions on how it will affect a vestigial sports tournament.
1 re-read the article
1 No it's pretty fair considering how ridiculously russia has been with doping so many of us athletes. Punishing a group for breaking rules isn't politics ffs. Russia having been allowed to keep completing this long was definitely political
1 Not if Kurt Russell has anything to say about it
1 No NHL players... So probably one of the scandinavian teams winning instead.
1 On an individual basis, but not as a National team. 
1 There really isn't much that can come out of his mouth (or Twitter feed) that will shock people anymore. 
1 They got caught though.
1 Good robert
1 Any sport where focus is a requirement a.k.a any sport.
1 Skiiing absolutely, leg strength makes a huge difference in the amount you can train and the amount of control you have.  Not to mention all the new stunt-oriented moguls and halfpipes and ski-jumping, etc.  Cross-country skiing obviously it helps as well with strength and endurance.  Bobsledding and Luge both benefit from stronger push-offs.  Curling is the only sport I can think of where it wouldn't help.
1 Have you ever been skiing or snowboarding? All of the sports you listed outside of curling would absolutely benefit from doping. It may be less common in those sports, but it would absolutely help.
1 There are a lot of reasons.  Probably the biggest though is that it disrupts their regular season schedule and exposes their players to potentially serious injuries.  In some Olympics it's worth it for them anyways.  Like when it was in Canada, there at least weren't travel issues, and then it would have been a big headache for them not to participate in the Russian games given the Russian stars that make the NHL their home.  However, South Korea isn't as exciting a destination for the NHL.They tried to get some degree of compensation out of the IOC in exchange for their continued participation and didn't succeed in that, which led to the NHL pulling out.  Perhaps they'll be back in 2022 given that those Olympics will be in China and the NHL wants to grow the game there.
1 In addition to the season coordination issues, which have been long since understood and dealt with between the  league, the teams, and the players, the NHL is attempting to make their own international hockey tournament, and see the winter Olympic games as a threat to their new revenue source. So they're backing out of it to deligitimize the games by not allowing some of the best in the world to compete. 
1 NHL isn't allowed to advertise itself at the olympics so garry bettman barred the players from playing, its all about money and Bettman doesn't want to lose a few weeks of advertising $$
1 Because the NHL is greedy and don't want to lose money.
1 Sometimes pulling out is the best thing to do.
1 Because Gary Bettman is a fuckhead. 
1 IIRC the NHL wanted rights to game footage as well and the IOC refused. They would be loaning players to a tournament and exposing them to injury with 0 compensation in return. 
1 owners want more money. period. Greed. Whenever the answer doesn't make sense, the answer is greed.
1 upvote for username
1 The real reason is purely money for the NHL. It has **nothing** to do with scheduling or injuries.The NHL started their own "international" tournament called the World Cup of Hockey. It's strictly an NHL brand and I use quotations on international because they made an U-23 team and a Europe Team, so hardly between nations. Two gimmick teams at the expense of real nationalities. Did the owners care about injuries at that tournament? Nope.Did the owners care about scheduling conflicts and having a condesned season? Nope.But they'll use those reasons for their crocodile tears when they talk to the media about the Olympics lmao.
1 Because Gary Bettman wants to grow the great sport of hockey. You want hockey to spread to countries and cities that hockey isn't very popular? Theres a global platform to showcase the best of the best hockey players to the whole world? Nah we don't need that. Oh players want to go and represent their countries in the olympics? Oh owners are willing to let their players go? Nah they can't do that. **FUCK GARY BETTMAN THAT SHORT LITTLE TROLL OF A HUMAN**
1 The owners didn't want their prize possessions to get hurt 
1 I'm with you there.  I can see what the issues were for the NHL, but Olympic hockey with NHL players was amazing and I would have loved to see the likes of McDavid and Crosby against Kane and Matthews.
1 What is the reason for them pulling put?
1 Its not a done deal that they never will again. NHL players want to go, so it will likely be a point of contention in the next set of CBA talks 
1 Pros only started playing in the Olympics  a couple decades ago... it is an "amateur" event after all
1 You are so wrong! We will see great hockey. Lots of junior and college players , with points to prove.. NHL players, play hard but have to be careful because of their contracts. 
1 You don't need doping to make hockey exciting...
1 Just like weightlifting at London 2012 105 kg. 
1 I can't speak for others, but I would actually take it more seriously. I *like* watching the minnows play, if for the sheer novelty factor.
1 It will be like soccer.
1 Dude, the first couple of tournaments were just Canada curb stomping everyone. At least today even the junior level of hockey is competitive. 
1 And how many of non usa can and russia are nhlers
1 I'm sure that Russia was looking forward to this year's tournament prior to this ruling.  With the NHL out, Russia was the heavy favorite.  Now I would think that Sweden/Finland are the tournament favorites.
1 It's always been about the curling imo.
1 > Are any hockey fans even looking forward to the olympics this year?Hockey is pretty much the only sport in the winter Olympics I care about, regardless of it's juniors or pros playing, so yup.
1 I enjoy watching the top division at my local amateur rink so, yes.  As long as the parity is good and the players are invested, I'm still looking forward to watching.It may not be "the best" as you say but a sport doesn't need to have full on stacked rosters to be exciting.
1 i sure am.  canada can still put together a great team, and it's more fun if there are more unknowns.
1 I watch the world juniors, so yeah I'm excited.. I watch NHL all season, so some fresh faces will be good
1 Yes, the women's tournament will be excellent.
1 I don't care if it's the special olympics, my ass will be planted firmly in front of the TV when USA plays Canada.
1 It will be fun to cheer on a bunch of rejects that haven't been in the NHL for years. The quality of play will be terrible, but I'll still watch Olympic Hockey.
1 If QMJHL players are allowed I know a lot of Canadians would still be interested.
1 Women's hockey Is still a treat 
1 The NHLs pull out will hurt the USA just as much as Canada. The winner will be one of Sweden or Finland, as they have plenty of high quality talent in their own leagues.
1 Have you ever been to Winter Carnival in Quebec? Even middle school Canadian hockey is fun to watch!
1 I personally can't see the US competing with the Scandinavians.  
1 What a bunch of children. "Punish Russia for doping?!?!?!? We'll pull our Asia-spanning league!"
1 Apparently the KHL is considering withdrawing from the IIHF and preventing players from participating in spite of the IIHF's pressure.  We'll have to see where that leads.
1 Here's the link itself to save someone 20 seconds: https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079
1 I didn't know what to expect going into Icarus, but wow that is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the way it all plays out is crazy
1 What an absolutely crazy rabbit hole of a documentary.  I started watching with low expectations, and was blown away by the end.
1 Icarus is an incredible film.  Absolutely loved it.
1 I watched that movie when it came out, and i must say its an absolut amazing documentary and really thrilling and had me sit on the edge. Everyone should watch it - it also made me think if other big countries such as America, China or others do the same thing.
1 Magnitsky next!
1 Only because he's exposing a Russian scandal, if it was the other way around the US government would want him dead.
1 Great fucking film. I learned a lot about the olympics and doping.
1 Pretty sure Trump is gonna pull the US out of the "fake"  Olympics now  ... Sad
1 Grigory is currently in the U.S. witness protection program, probably being hunted by FSB agents on U.S. soil. 
1 He’s currently in protective custody in the USA. His wife/family are back in Russia.  They have taken away their money, interrogated them etc. Someone he worked with has already had a suspicious heart attack.If they don’t kill him, he’s never going to be able to live a normal life.
1 No country responds well with whistleblowers 
1 Absolutely, it also shows again that it often only takes one person to speak up to take down an entire system.Many people do things that aren't strictly legal or that are blatantly illegal in their daily jobs because they think that they won't be able to change anything anyways. Time and time again, we see that one person can be all it takes.
1 WOW holy shit! I love the Olympics so much. I watch every sport (thank you DVR technology). Not every round of course, but I love the idea of the Olympics - bringing so many nations together through people with true passion for their talent. So many smiling faces during the opening and closing ceremonies. So much pride and happiness and supportive nations and families and cultures coming together and even the slight edge to it that the competitive nature of sport brings. I am sad for those who work hard who are held back by the political side, because the Olympics is a really nice, wholesome, wonderful way to bring people together from around the world. 
1 It is pretty amazing what, IMO, Russia will go to to protect it's image. In the US, if something like this were to happen, I feel like some would be ashamed, some upset, others apathetic. From my view, however small, Russia wants to protect itself AT ALL COSTS, be it poor battle planning, sports doping, or candy crush high scores. 
1 This is how you turn your own citizens against you.
1 He went into WPP at the end of the documentary Icarus
1 He fled to the US.
1 Have you ever seen downhill skiing!? There has always been a risk.
1 That's basically how deals with persecuters work. Criminals laying out the bigger picture for a reduced sentence.
1 If hes a criminal so are the people that ordered him to do this.  That is unless you expect people to believe that he personally had the ability to cause a major fsb operation around sochi 14'.Sounds like he is the criminal lackey of the criminal putin.  Thankfully he has a conscious, unlike putin, and decided to do the right thing, even though it means leaving the country of his birth, his wife and children behind.  Thats the actions of a man with morals.  Again, unlike putin. Did I mention that putin is a murderous piece of shit?
1 He still does. Nearly every whistleblower was previously involved in the shady shit they uncovered. 
1 Are you not familiar with what a whistleblower is?
1 Without his testimony, records on the three hard drives he smuggled out of Russia, and the fact that he would’ve been killed by Russia, this would’ve all been swept under the rug. They would’ve never found out how the Russians swapped the urine in sochi and found the records of all the things taken by each athlete of it weren’t for him. So yeah, he deserves respect
1 Why? Do you think the average Russian is pro-doping?This isn't a betrayal of Russia, this is a victory for truth. 
1 > wonder what would lead one to betray their country like that. If I were Russian I'd hate him too.because your country is everything to you?
1 Really? So you think there is no possible justification to leak information about illegal actions committed by a country?I mean, I can somewhat understand people who argue that Snowden et al have endangered Americans but this doping case seems to be pretty 'positive' all around.What about Staufenberg's assassination attempt on Hitler? 
1 Not all of them, only those that get approval:>Those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. 
1 That seems like it would be a significant slap in the face to such a nationalistic country.
1 ... Russia is still banned. You can't see why maybe they'd be a little upset by it all?
1 Only those who can prove a history of no doping is what the article says. 
1 Those caught doping obviously won't be able to compete, but there's no reason to take years of training away from an athlete that did nothing wrong. Russia as a country was banned from the Olympics because they had a state sponsored doping program.
1 They are only allowed to compete if they have a history of extensive drug testing.  Not sure who makes this determination, but I imagine this will prevent a number of athletes from competing.
1 Select individuals will (most likely) receive special dispensation to compete. They won't all be allowed to compete.
1 How does that work?
1 What anthem would play if a 'neutral' wins gold?It feels like playing the silver medalist's anthem would be an extra slap in the face.
1 because this isn't about doping. Its about the what the media wants us to think about Russia. Go read some articles from the athletes perspective.
1 I'm glad that the athletes who weren't doping are going to be allowed to compete.
1 How so?
1 So if one of them wins gold in an event what flag flies & what song plays?
1 The point of state sponsored doping is to show that country as number 1.
1 Good point, It'll be under the Ukrainian flag
1 But that's even worse I think. The athletes were the one that fucked up. They should be the one receiving the punishment, not the country. They should have been those athletes instead of the country. 
1 This is exactly in line with what their propaganda machine is churning out every day on the news. The evil Americans and Europeans are conspiring against Russia to destroy it, and we must unite as a country to not let them win. Putin is our strong and worthy leader, and he will protect Russia with all his might. Everything is a conspiracy. Every news article from the west is fake. Every protestor is hired. Nothing is real. Russia is the last true stronghold of civilization.My wife is Russian, and it's just impossible to discuss anything remotely related to politics without her dragging up insane conspiracy theories. Russia had, and still has a lot of troops on the ground in Ukraine, right? Russian soldiers have disclosed a lot of information on social media about their presence there, and journalists from around the world have reported their presence. The local inhabitants have made thousands of videos of Russians soldiers. Something must be going on there, right? WRONG!! It's just fake news from the West.
1 *pompousAnd its spelled "pedantic", in case you were wondering.
1 You and the person above are incredibly naive. Every olympic athlete is on PEDs, every single one.This is a very weird decision actually.
1 And steroids.  Lots and lots of steroids.
1 With drugs and hookers
1 Actually, forget the olympics and blackjack.
1 In fact, forget the olympics and the blackjack!
1 And Roulette!
1 The funny thing - they probably willA makeshift competition with Kazakhstan, Belarus and other ‘friendly states’ while thrashing an already empty budget
1 It actually is. I.O.C. is loosing money, because now none of the Russian channels will be buying rights for streaming Olympics. As well as most of the tickets will be returned. It's not grand, but still in realm of millions of dollars.
1 I'm going to suggest that everyone also watch *Lady in the Water* by M. Night Shyamalan.Doesn't have to with anything I just know that's a movie you haven't seen in a long while and it's an okay movie.
1 If he dies, he dies. 
1 AND HE STILL LOST USA!! USA!! USA!!! 
1 He also AK 47s an entire bar of people for literally no reason
1 his jaw is like iron
1 Olympic athletes are drug screened a lot. Some definitely dope but not all.
1 Most of them probably do. Only in this case it was state sponsored and involved their intelligence agencies to cover it up, which adds a whole new dimension to it.
1 Only certain athletes are being invited by the ioc. They dont decide who goes
1 Who's to say they're weaker for it? They may have lost some, but still had  a net gain for it. 
1 He's also been successfully gaslighting the shit out of America. Russia looks better when their peers appear worse.
1 Win win
1 If a country's strength is measured in the buzz they generate then we'd look at North Korea and Iran as world powers, so there is a distinct difference there.
1 Me too, but I doubt it. Putin's been getting away with shit like this for decades. 
1 The Olympic stuff? Nah. He's only getting more powerful. Additionally, the power structure is so corrupt from the top down that even IF Putin was unseated, he would be replaced with a good pal of his.   
1 Actually this is a pretty good outcome for him. The current narrative is "the West is doing everything to undermine and weaken Russia". The ban fits this narrative pretty well and will probably fuel another wave of "patriotic" propaganda.
1 Never.Be ready to see him as president of Russia till his death. Whatever way it should happen.
1 He will simply use this. "Look at the West with their russophobia, let's unite around our great leader" and shit like this.
1 It's not. His message will be that the outside world wants to punish mother Russia again because they can't allow them to win, or something similar, and propaganda is still very strong in the country. Also looking at other world countries (I'm looking at you USA, but also Italy) I have the impression that the tendency is more in favour of Putins types of leaders, populist and corrupt, than the opposite.
1 Actually Russia's system has been all the way from the tsars to now based on a very little number of people possessing most of the wealth. So nothing new on this side.And someone would argue that if you look at the big picture it's pretty much the same everywhere else. But the scale in Russia is indeed staggering.
1 Olympics ARE NOT trivial. I don't care how much a person doesn't care for sports, the Olympics have been a huge event that hundreds of millions if not a billion people watch or keep track of. They are a big part of history and the world being able to come together and compete against each other. It brings immense amount of patriotism and support from around the world. To top it all off, the amount of money put into something like this gigantic, it is anything but trivial.
1 Yes, but what good did he do?
1 It was just coming out of a ruinous Communist dictatorship that lasted 70 years, of course it was in bad shape. Plus, the price of oil was low.
1 There at least was a hope for better future.
1 His government did it, it's as simple as that, he can plead ignorance but that is a pathetic excuse that no one with half a brain should believe and even if he was unaware that is almost as bad, it mean Putin was unaware of what several high ranking members of his government and intelligence services were doing. 
1 Yes. 
1 no, people just like using him as someone to blame all the time
1 It's Reddit, he is now personally responsible for everything that redditors feel is wrong in the world.
1 The USSR was far more of a world power than Russia is now, how young are you?
1 The fuck....Russia WAS a world power for those 70 years. It was a superpower, ffs. Putin's Russia is little more than a pale shadow of that.
1 Bahahaha "world power" sure. How is their blue-water navy holding up, is it able to project power to any ocean in the world? Oh wait, that's right, they don't have one. They have a single carrier that has to be lugged around via tugboat. 
1 TIL the USSR wasnt a world power....
1 huh?
1 I'd say a good amount, actually, here is an exert from an article:"But their relationship took a bizarre turn in November 2015, when news reports alleged that Rodchenkov was a key figure in Russia's state-sponsored doping program during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Fearing for his life, Rodchenkov fled to the U.S. with Fogel's help and confessed on camera that he oversaw the swapping out of hundreds of athletes' urine samples during the Sochi games. "Fogel is the filmmaker. While I do not know the exact extent in which he "helped" Rodchenkov escape. He certainly played a role in helping not only protect the whistleblower to get him out of the country, he also helped to shed light on the entire controversy.I'd say it was an important factor from what I've read/seen. Pretty amazing stuff in my opinion, I'm super happy SOMETHING has been done finally after all the facts came out.
1 I can't wait to see Trump come out and denounce this decision on behalf of Putin
1 I really hope Blizzard uses this opportunity to make a Zarya skin with a neutral uniform
1 I'm glad they get to compete, but one part of me feels bad for them. A lot of the Olympics is national pride and being able to represent your country, and competing under a neutral flag does lose some of that aspect of the Olympics.
1 Can they change the flag or at least the music to something else? Like I'd want the music from the end of A New Hope
1 No. No Russian anything, teams or individuals. Edit: they can't form a team under a neutral flag
1 I would imagine the KHL will probably block their players from going even if they want to and are clean in protest of this decision
1 Slimy Russians gonna slime. 
1 Respect? Never. Fear? Definitely 
1 [Nuetrapolans unite!](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/true_neutral_embassy_1933.jpg) 
1 What about team sports? Someone said they can't form teams under neutral flag.
1 I think he meant the IOC bribes to get the Olympics in Sochi 
1 To my knowledge, we have never utilized the state to do so.  Russia enlisted its intelligence services to help beat anti doping measures.
1 US athletes have definitely doped to gain an advantage but I haven't heard of any evidence indicating our Olympic delegation plotted to cheat systematically (nor have I of China). That's the difference.
1 Do you have evidence of US state-sponsored doping?
1 No, US doesn't have a state sponsored doping program.
1 I definitely believe that the US team has systemic doping, but the thing is that there isn't proof for that. Individual athletes have been caught, but there's been nothing like the evidence that was revealed about what Russia was doing at Sochi.
1 Actually being punished compared to the weakness shown by allowing Russia to compete in Rio.
1 Ya, exactly. If Russia was allowed to participate even with all these obvious scandals, Putin would have probably made a jab at the world about how Russia can get away with anything. Of course he would have said it in a very subtle manner so that everyone in on it can laugh about it and everyone else is naïve.
1 Doping is pretty much meaningless for the figure skating... 
1 Unless Russia bans them from going.
1 Wait, what? did they change to rules to prohibit pro players again?
1 I would put Czech Republic and Slovakia before Switzerland.
1 The question now is who has the most almost-NHL-quality players.  I still wouldn't bet against Canada.
1 Canada still has a ton of semi-pro players because the sport is so popular in Canada. However, now it's a much more even field and it can get interesting with Sweden, USA, and Finland also being contenders
1 Wow my keyboard didn't come with one of those. 
1 No you didn't
1 I know it's a silly old movie, but *Cool Runnings* absolutely made the push-off seem like 90% of the battle.
1 That makes sense, thanks!
1 The US female gymnast takes ADHD drugs. This is blatant double standards, if what you're saying is correct. 
1 TRALALALA BAD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES LETS BAN OLYMPICS 
1 I don't think it's bad behavior. Nobody wants to go back to 11 second 100m dash. They're all doped to the gills and what's more, nothing will stop this. It's like prohibition or the war on drugs. Regulate the use and make sure the athletes use responsibly instead of shaming them for doing what the crowds want.
1 Wait, that's a rule? Why? We let NBA players play basketball, why shouldn't NHL players get to represent their countries?
1 Not true for curling, either. If you watch curling, you'd notice that teams have gotten a lot more fit over the last 15 or so years, as they've found that being in good shape for sweeping gives you a lot more control over the rocks trajectory.https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/wuIeSZwh8_TeUqbTHoRyyw/http/pbs.twimg.com/media/BgAkjljCMAAZFIx.jpg
1 Perhaps we will go back to the good ole days. Craft the best possible team through mostly kids tryna make it big!
1 >They tried to get some degree of compensation out of the IOC in exchange for their continued participation and didn't succeed in that, which led to the NHL pulling out.Ah, there it is. So it's actually about money. 
1 *their
1 They should claim to be a summer sport now like basketball and play in the summer olympics.
1 The NHL is also hoping the World Cup of Hockey will fill the Olympics role for professional players.But these tournaments are useless because Canada is just going to win no matter what level players are going
1 Wait, NHL decides this on an Olympic by Olympic bases?
1 If I remember correctly, the only NHL team that was going to allow players to compete in the Olympics was the Capitals.
1 I bet it has to do with the drug testing this time around is going to be under extra scrutiny. 
1 What serious injuries are they exposed to that they aren't in the regular league?
1 Wow. I wish I knew vaginas like you know hockey.
1 Your talking about the World Cup of Hockey and it blows. No one wants to watch it. 
1 lol wut? Nope..... The NHL is not: > attempting to make their own international hockey torunamentThe WCOH was an experiment, it is not expected to happen again. Even if it were, it would likely be occuring every four years, and the NHL wouldnt be daft or illogical enough to schedule the WCOH during the Olympics, so they obviously would/do not see > Olympic winter games as a threat to their new revenue source. I hope your pulling this out of someone elses ass as well as your own, otherwise thats a whole lot of shit.Edit: 4
1 A young all-star is literally worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a team. Someone like Stamkos, Ovechkin, etc is easily going to bring a team that much return - or more - in team performance, playoff gate revenue, merchandising, etc.The Olympics is asking the NHL to:- (a) stop their season for 3 weeks,- (b) send **all** of their all-stars halfway across the planet,- (c) to pay for all the *insurance* themselves, - (d) risk short-term, long-term or career-ending injury to each and every player,**and**- (e) the NHL can't commercialize or profit off *anything*.If you owned assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, something tells me you wouldn't ship those assets across the planet, for *somebody else* to make a shitload of money off of, none of which you will ever see.
1 Because the IOC is greedier and doesn't want to pay. The IOC refused to pay for insurances for the NHL players attending, which from the point of view of NHL owners means they'd just be allowing their assets to go and risk hurting themselves and their businesses, so the owners collectively said nope to all that. Hockey is a business first and foremost.
1 You're confusing greed for frugality. Not wanting to lose money is frugal, wanting more money is greed. Not saying the NHL isn't greedy. But not wanting to millions of dollars is not greedy.
1 Sending your leagues players to the Olympics is a great way to grow the game and get national publicity. The NHL doesn't want their players to be injured for the season, so they deny players the chance to play for their country. A lot of players have been playing their whole life with the goal to make it to the Olympics. The NHL shouldn't just be able toss that aside 
1 And the IOC... isn't greedy? o.OLMFAO
1 I don't want to lose money, am I greedy? 
1 businesses not wanting to lose money lmao idiots
1 Trying to make a living isn’t greedy...
1 The NHL never loses money because of the Olympics. It is just bad for the players.
1 NHL get paid the worst out of any national level athletes. There are NHL folks earning like $50k a year. They have a reason to be salty 
1 What will Canada do now? How do they recruit for a hockey team?
1 Middle of the season.  $$$$$$$
1 Owners don't want their star players potentially injured playing hockey for their country. 
1 Short answer: $$$$Longer answer: It requires the NHL to adjust their in season schedule and open up teams to the liability of their player being injured when not playing for the team. In return the NHL got nothing back from the IOC. The crux was using Olympic highlights and pictures for NHL advertisements I believe. IOC played hardball, so the NHL backed out.  
1 Wear and tear on the players, no NHL team wants their players to wear themselves out or get hurt in a tournament that doesn't lead to the Cup.
1 IIRC, the NHL used to take a break in the middle of the season to let players go play for their respective countries. This shortened the season, meaning less money. But probably a bigger reason, these teams are under contract to play for them for millions. They don't want to risk sending their assets off to play games that don't benefit their teams, and risk season ending or career ending injuries. 
1 I think some teams have on an individual basis allowed players to go since then. Maybe you're right, but I doubt the NHL will make that the overall policy again. 
1 I mean everyone else trains non stop for 4 years with sponsorships for it. It hasn’t been an amateur event in my lifetime 
1 ...no it’s not
1 It literally isn’t an amateur event.
1 Not true in terms of the roster that Canada has preliminarily out together. A mix of ex-NHLers and players playing in Europe. Not many junior/College players at all. 
1 The kids from college and the CHL already have their "Olympics" and it starts on Boxing Day.Canada will send a Spengler Cup type team at best.
1 [Until you remember the ENTIRE U18 Russian team dropped out of world’s because of doping as well](http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/doping-scandal-sees-entire-russian-u18-team-replaced-at-world-championships)
1 I think he/she means you need players from the two best leagues in the world.  But hockey's awesome at all levels, I still think it could be fun.
1 But good players help
1 Well, not *that* kind of dope.
1 *Whoosh*
1 pretty sure doping makes most things exciting.... which is why people do it
1 You need way more than doping to make it exciting, you’re right 
1 You do kind of need the best players in the world, though. 
1 If both the NHL and KHL are out then why would Sweden or Finland be any more of a favorite than Canada or any of the usual favorites?All the best players from Finland and Sweden play in the NHL or KHL as well.
1 People keep saying that but they also keep forgetting that many of the top performers in the KHL and other leagues are Canadian
1 Do the words "Cool Runnings" mean  nothing to you? 
1 "the best competing" is like the entire point of the olympics is it not?Sure I can go watch some 3rd rate players compete at something, but the reason to watch the olympics is to see "the best" competing against each other no? 
1 Except that we already know the final will be USA v Canada because there are only 2 good teams.
1 They are technically if they don't have an NHL contract but won't be going. The best Junior players are not a match for even an AHLer. The only way I could see that is if there was a generational talent like Connor McDavid who is 2018 draft eligible right now (which there isn't)
1 I find women's hockey just doesn't have enough good teams.Like what are the odds on a USA v Canada final? 99%?
1 you might be right. I was just talking shit. 
1 The WHL And even Junior A talent is pretty spot on, so even with the NHL and anyone with NHL contracts out, I’m not worried. 
1 I'd argue it hurts the USA more since they don't have the same depth spread out across the world.
1 I mean, is that really out of character for Putin?
1 Now I have 20 seconds more to spend pressing "refresh" on reddit 
1 Thank you
1 Incredible documentary.
1 Probably one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. I have no interest in cycling or doping for that matter, but I could not stop watching that show.
1 Thought the same thing!
1 Rogan had the guy that made it on his podcast. Worth a listen imo. 
1 It's like a James Bond film, all the cloak and dagger stuff around stealing and replacing drug test samples, the special locked bottles they used, the security, really amazing stuff. 
1 Why is it rated MA? Language? I'm just curious since I'm at work and thinking of whether I should watch with kids. Thanks!
1 There's that factor of pure luck for the director of being in contact with the "right person" at the "right time" that made it from a standard documentary into an incredible chronicle of a unique moment in sports.
1 Same. I was casually watching it when my husband put it on, and by the end I was on the edge of my seat. Plus lots of cute doggos in the beginning. 
1 *Minor Spoilers*I was disappointed in some ways with the movie. As a cyclist I was really interested in the first portion, then felt kind of let down when it seems like they totally abandoned that Haute Route plot for the Rodchenkov one. That storyline was probably more interesting and had mass appeal, but I found it disappointing to not really provide closure for the first half of the movie. On the other hand, they probably didn't have enough content to produce an entire film about Rodchenkov. If so, I'm glad they didn't try and drag anything out.Would still recommend watching it. In fact, I clicked on here to check that someone suggested it.
1 It really was just a incredible set of happenstance, what would have been a very interesting documentary turns into something complete different and even better. 
1 I still don't understand why it didn't make a bigger splash, my jaw was on the floor the whole time I was watching it. Though I suppose it may be pushed back into the limelight now...
1 Follow that up with Tour De Pharmacy!
1 Just so everyone knows, despite the numerous cop shows and movies, the Witness Protection Program has never failed, ever.
1 I believe his wife and family are still in Russia though. Basing this on info I heard a couple months back.
1 Trump will give him up to his Russian masters
1 Or Russia overthrows Putin and installs a government that actually represents the people.
1 He will never be able to live a normal life first and foremost because he is simply considered a traitor. Many believe that he run away not because he suddenly felt the urge to tell the truth, but because he was  a criminal about to get caught in Russia.  With a reputation like this, who would even want to hire him? 
1 Not all countries have Russia reputation for killing journalists and whistleblowers. 
1 That's what I was thinking the whole time I was watching Icarus and it was going through how pivotal he was throughout the whole fucking thing to Putin conspiracy to dope athletes.  That is a LOT of fucking trust you're putting into one guy, who you probably don't even know well... and who is also living in a plain house/apartment and obviously not making a lot of money... aside from how much he values wealth, if he does at all.All it takes is one slight, or one moment of consciousness, and you can take the whole thing down.Some definite parallels to that are probably very present in Trump's circle as we speak.Of course, Putin just fucking whacks you when you turn on him, but yeah.
1 > It is pretty amazing what, IMO, Russia will go to to protect it's image.What surprises me is they think they have an image to save.
1 Everyone out to be on the look out for bots and Russian cyberinfluencers about this story. Russia goes to some crazy lengths to protect its image. 
1 What is WPP? 
1 I think the average Russian is Pro-Russia, regardless of the circumstances behind it. The reality is most Americans would be the same, regardless of how sanctimonious people may act on Reddit.
1 I'd really like to know what a neutral uniform looks like. Solid grey?
1 Yes, but it doesn't actually stop them from competing, so it's still impacting everyone else. And you can be sure everyone will know how many medals "Russia" wins.
1 Not really, Russia will claim all the medals anyways
1 Nationalistic country you say? Lmao I’ve never seen a Russian wearing those hideous flag pants 🇱🇷 or heard about the military paying to be part of sports events. Don’t get me wrong I’m not a Russia fan it’s just utterly bizarre to see this kind of finger pointing 
1 Absolutely, it’s a huge international embarrassment, especially for a country like Russia and Putin in particular. Also, only certain “clean” Russian athletes will be able to compete and I believe they have to be invited to compete by the IOC. So, the amount of Russian athletes in the games is sure to be greatly diminished and they’re all presumably be clean as well. 
1 Yes, I can see why. I also think it's not enough, because they're still able to send their athletes, just "not under their flag." Fucking lmao
1 Lol, we'll see what a shitshow that proves to be. STUFF THEM ENVELOPES
1 Yea there is. The puppet masters suck.
1 >  Not sure who makes this determination,I'll give you a hint: a group notorious for accepting scrillions in bribes!
1 Badly, I expect.
1 Apparently it'll be the Olympic anthem.
1 Clearly you haven't really read up on the story.  It was not individual athletes.  It was highly organized by national groups.
1 They were banned for having a systemic, state sponsored doping regiment, not because some athletes were caught   
1 It should be both.
1 Athletes and country are both in the wrong. The country facilitated the doping for the athletes. 
1 Were they?  There is a fine line between choice and coercion when you are part of a national sports team.  Even more fine is the line when you deal with the rumors that abound about how things work in Russia.
1 The athletes aren't *all* being allowed in automatically. They have to appeal, and they're only supposed to get approval if they have a history of clean drug tests.And the country did fuck up. This went beyond just some athletes testing positive:>In an elaborate overnight operation at the 2014 Sochi Games, a team assembled by Russia’s sports ministry tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition.
1 The state sponsored the program and is absolutely responsible here.
1 The sad thing is if you changed Russia to USA and it doesn't sound too weird 
1 *Pamplemousse 
1 Auto-complete strikes again. And no, I meant pompous. - Pompous -Characterized by excessive self-esteem or exaggerated dignity; pretentious: pompous officials who enjoy giving orders. - adj. - Full of high-sounding phrases; bombastic: a pompous proclamation. - adj. - Chracterized by pomp or stately display; ceremonious: a pompous occasion.I can't think of a better word for this given situation. In fact, it seems to sum up the Russian government and its attitude entirely. 
1 I think you're being overly pedandic.
1 Evidently Russia sucks enough to get caught then
1 That’s not true. 
1 I think it is beautiful. Russia deserves every bit of it. 
1 I'd watch dat.
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vocj9IwcRk
1 I always set my money loose, it isn't right to keep it captive. Let it roam free as nature intended.
1 This was somehow an effective recommendation and now I'm going to watch this movie.
1 Is that the one with Paul Giamatti? That man is a treasure.
1 That movie is actually super okay.
1 That was one of the most unwatchably bad movies I've ever seen. It's the one that finally convinced me not to even attempt to watch Shyamalan movies anymore. 
1 I must break you.
1 Like Doughboy to Dre.
1 But first he'll live.
1 usually that ends with the dictator hanging or with their head in a basket
1 IF he somehow got unseated, which is about as likely as hell freezing over, it'd probably be Surkov or Medvedev. However, they would not have nearly the cult like following he has, it would be big blow to Russian authoritarianism. Many people are loyal to Putin first, and all the ones like the siloviki and oligarchs won't be loyal to anyone else unless they are facing prison time. Putin is the string that hold the whole thing together. As soon as Putin goes down, everyone is going to prison. 
1 Some guy named Vadim Butin probably, Just Putin with a mustache.
1 Having read the BBC article on the subject, that is pretty much exactly the Russian MPs /heads of committees etc are saying...That Russia has done nothing wrong and this is the wests pathetic attempt to remove them from sporting glory
1 In the grand scheme of things, pretty trivial.
1 I don't think the person you're replying to claimed he did any good.
1 Oh Piss off. The man's a monster.
1 Just because it had nukes doesn't make it a super power lol
1 They seize sovereign land with impunity so they still have some power. They are still one of a handful of nuclear powers and as such are a permanent world power.
1 lol define world power. They had nukes sure. Not much else. Is Pakistan a world power?
1 There are conspiracies that the miracle on ice was some sort of government plot in order to undermine Soviet Russia. Accusations ranging from steroids, bribing refs, drugging the Russian players, etc.I love conspiracies, but personally dont think the evidence is really there. Maybe some steroid issues. But nothing that suggest state sponsored, and likely used by both teams.
1 Trump: "VERY STUPID IOC ruled Russia not allowed to Olympics but Russia didn't want to go to there anyway. IOC uninvited to my CHRISTMAS party. SAD!"
1 Hadn't even thought of that, Jesus. The tweets will be incredible
1 She already has her goth outfit. What more do you want?!?!
1 Only the clean athletes get to compete.  You trying to tell me Zarya's not juicing?
1 I think you *should* be less proud to represent your country if your country systematically cheats like that.  It sucks for those clean athletes but actions have consequences.
1 A lot of the Olympics is commercialism and exchanging gobs of money under the table.    ftfy
1 I don't think you should have any national pride when your country got caught cheating. I would want to cover my face and look away from embarrassment.
1 > > Edit: they can't form a team under a neutral flagSo no one Russian, even clean, will participate in team games?
1 That is harsh for the teams that competed clean
1 The KHL is an IIHF member and so in theory the IIHF can force them to allow their players to go. In practice we'll see how well that goes. I think there's already a rumor that the KHL will leave the IIHF.
1 I agree with this and I imagine Putin will try to do same with the individual athletes. May see an attempted full boycott
1 Say it with me: "I have no strong feelings one way or the other!"
1 "What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
1 Was only commenting on this guys admission of China.
1 There is no proof that it exists or doesn't exist. 
1 I agree that the systemic doping in Sochi was next level but guaranteed there's systemic doping in the States as well with coaches, doctors etc working hard to keep their athletes testing clean. 
1 The McLaren report came after the Rio Olympics.  All Russian athletes were heavily tested going into the Rio games because of the 2014 documentary and then the May 2016 Times article which revealed the Rodchenkov stuff.  Since then, the punishments have been swift and severe.  Banning a country from competing is serious and normally reserved for losers of world wars or countries who violate human rights or support regimes who do so.  Correct me if I am wrong about any of this.Personally, I think they had to build a case, they had the athletes interests in mind, and banning a country is not taken lightly.  Why Russia was even awarded an Olympics is beyond me.
1 Track and Field Team was completely banned....Swimmers were almost completely banned as well....So I don't know about that weakness part. Just FYI, a lot of athletes were banned from competing who had decade long history of drug free performance and who were very obviously not doping. 
1 Doping can help with focus, dexterity and endurance during practice and during a competition. It's not just about strength when it comes to doping
1 Nonsense. There’s lots of different kinds of Doping. It’s not all pure muscle and endurance enhancement . Some Doping lets the body recover faster after training sessions, enabling an athlete to train harder and more often, which in turn improves his skills faster than a competitor that hasn’t doped while training.
1 Not true. Doping isn't all anabolic steroids for strength gain. It could be blood doping, which increases endurance and reduces fatigue meaning more time for training than an legit athlete.
1 We'll find out soon enough. 
1 NHL owners wants money from the IOC to allow their players to compete. They never got to a deal so the pro players will not compete in the Olympics. Fucking assholes. 
1 I think it's actually the NHL's rules that are prohibiting players from going in 2018
1 It was the NHL's decision not to participate.  Though they made the decision in part because they couldn't get the concessions they wanted from the IOC.
1 no. NHL commish (Bettman) and the NHL owners couldn't reach a deal with the IOC to let NHL players compete in the olympics. so it was just going to be a ton of semi-professional players going.
1 Russia was the clear favorite until today. There is a decent number of NHL or almost-NHL level Russian players in the KHL. Sweden is probably the favorite now but by a slimmer margin. The European leagues have some good North American talent but tend to skew towards their own and the SHL is the next best league.
1 /r/MechanicalKeyboards 
1 Lol, it doesn't make any sense at all.
1 > doped to the gillsOnly in swimming.
1 The NHL and IOC couldn't come to terms on an agreement this Olympics. A big point was that the NHL would have to give up revenue, disrupt the regular schedule and risk player injury. The IOC refused to cover insurance for players, so the NHL decided to not go.
1 I kind of love watching curling, actually... I've noticed them getting more fit as you said and can see why that helps with control and mobility, but man that team is jacked!   Honest question: does that actually help or do they just like lifting for the sake of it?
1 It's going to be exactly that. College kids and NHL busts playing in Europe. Not sure if the ban extends to the AHL or Juniors, but I would imagine the AHL is since it's the main feeder for the NHL.
1 I mean that would have been a joke of a concept but if the KHL moves to pull out as well it'd make for a very interesting and almost purely amateur tournament.
1 QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!
1 The "good old days" only ended in 1998. That was the first winter games with NHLers. 
1 Perhaps we will go back to the good ole days. Chariot racing.
1 It will never go back to the good old days.  The thing that was great about 1980 was it was a rag tag bunch of college kids against a legitimate professional team that just got done whooping the ass of the NHL all star team.No such team exists anymore, so it will just be amateurs against amateurs and pretty much the exact same tournament as the World Junior tournament that happens every December. 
1 those werent "the good ole days". Why would I want to watch players who aren't the best compete for the title of being the best?
1 I liked the Olympic hockey better then.
1 Wait, what? Amateurs competing in a global sporting event, you say? You speak of madness! How could they keep up viewership without NBC filling close to 35% of their programming time with the same six commercials and filling 20% of the remaining airtime with personal interest sob stories of athletes overcoming great obstacles to train and participate, leaving the remaining airtime to focus on runs from America's premier skiers ranked 22nd and 42nd in the world, plus the three winners, the American two man luge ranked 12th in the world, plus the winners, the American women's two most likely biathalon entrants, plus the winners....and to keep production costs, they'd have to demote the most interesting announcer of the entire crew from the 1am telecast and simply play a remix of the earlier footage, plus 15% more commercials.Naw, nobody'd be stupid enough to threaten their viewership with a dumb business strategy like that every four years...
1 The World Juniors are a good example of this.  Generally clean good hockey with young kids trying to prove themselves.  On par with Olympic hockey.
1 Yeah the good old days.  Let's watch the olympics not to see the best athletes in the world.  Great idea.
1 It was always about the money. They don't care about injuries or interruptions to the season because of morality, just money.
1 Well yeah. The IOC makes shit ton off hockey in the Winter Olympics. The players see none of it, the NHL sees none of it even though they own the rights to these players etc. NHL even asked to be a partner or be able to use some of the footage of their players at the olympics. Nope.The NHL assumes all the risk, the IOC gets ALL the reward.
1 It’s a fair reason though. Their players could easily get hurt and miss time at their actual job, which hurts the owners and the team. NBA player Paul George missed almost the entire season a few years ago with an injury suffered in Olympic practice play.
1 The money the NHL wanted was insurance, cost of travel, and housing for the players. All of which are reasonable requests which the IOC has happily paid in the past. Especially given the risk of a career ending injury (which can be franchise altering) in any single game. 
1 Sure, but it's not like the IOC is about anything else either. The IOC is the one making hundreds of millions off the backs of the players, and their priority has been to hang onto every penny rather than to cover share some of the player costs. 
1 Good thing US athletes never use doping or this might look suspicious in more than one way.
1 (their regular season schedule)
1 Oops.  I fixed it, thank you.
1 I've actually heard some people suggest that.  It wouldn't make a ton of sense thematically.  Basketball is played on a court so it really isn't season specific, but hockey is played on ice so while you can technically play it year-round indoors, it just seems better to play it during the winter.  Even still, a Summer Olympic tournament would make things easier on the NHL and other hockey leagues given that it doesn't disrupt their season.
1 Yep.  Although the NHL has had a string of Olympics in a row that they did participate in, they haven't been committing to it long-term.  Each time we move towards the Olympics, we have to go through the whole "will they, won't they" song and dance again (although some Olympics are easier to guess than others), but the difference is this time they decided that they won't.
1 The same exact injuries, just in a different league. Makes sense
1 Their contracts are not for the Olympics, and as such, those injuries pose a greater risk to the NHL. It is business, not personal.
1 That's not the point. NHL players are theoretically compensated for potential injury. Olympians are not.
1 None, but for one they get Dollars, for the other, not so much.
1 Similar to the criticism of Thursday Night Football I imagine. More frequent games, less recovery, and a bigger chance of snapping your shit up, and they aren't being compensated for it.
1 Getting injured within the job they are paid to do by the league <> getting **injured** in a "bonus" tournament with little bearing on the NHL's economics.I don't know much about hockey but TV ratings would absolutely take a hit if major stars went down since casual fans would tune out.
1 It's kind of like how they pull the big stars out of games when it's already won. There's just no reason to have your big stars play extra time and risk normal injuries that happen every game, when it's not going to give you anything in return.
1 The difference is that when they're exposed to injuries during NHL games, then at least it's a byproduct of their season.  If they get hurt in the Olympics and that hurts the team's shot at making some of that playoff revenue, then that feels a lot worse for the owners and ultimately it's the owners that have to be convinced to let the players go.  So while, yes, they are exposed to injuries either way, that doesn't mean that the owners consider both scenarios equal.
1 What is it and why does it blow?
1 go home 
1 Wrong on the first point. The NHL obviously wants to have the premiere international tournament. https://www.nhl.com/news/world-cup-of-hockey-will-be-held-in-2020/c-279304374
1 Does the IOC do that for literally any other competitor though? I've never heard of anyone even proposing this before the NHL did.EDIT: Has the NHL always had this arrangement? I was under the impression it was new.
1 Hockey is a sport first and foremost. 
1 >Hockey is a business first and foremost.Maybe to you.
1 Hockey is a sport first and foremos.
1 IIHF offered to pay for the insurance, the NHL made more demands from the IOC not granted to any other professional league. NHL is definitely being greedy here.
1 >Hockey is a business first and foremost.Only Americans could say stupid shit like this. It's a competitive sport. Treat it like that. Players are competitors and the Olympics are one of the greatest thing a competitor could participate in. But i see Americans want to view Sports as something else. 
1 If everyone can risk harming their star players doesn't it just level the playing field?
1 Right, of the IOC was not a huge dollar grab it would be different. The olympics is just everyone coming together to grab as much as you can get away with. The first Olympian to turn away all of their corporate sponsorships and post games deals will be the first Olmpian to do so.
1 Making it to the olympics really isn't a big deal for hockey players like it is for other sports. And if some players really do want to play in the olympics they can join a different league can't they? 
1 They can both be?  The IOC being greedy does not prevent the NHL from being greedy and trying to hang on to their own profits
1 Two things can be true.
1 You aren't turning over any of your profits to the IOC. So yes, you are greedy.
1 The NHL could have just taken a break in the middle of the season and extend the end of the season later to make up for the money. 
1 You are correct, however there is a vast gulf between earning a living and being greedy.
1 No, the players wants to play but the owners refuse to let them play.https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-will-not-participate-in-2018-winter-olympics/c-288385598"Chief among them was the 17-day break in the schedule required in February, a time when the National Football League's season has ended and Major League Baseball's season has yet to begin.""The IOC (International Olympic Committee) had been paying for the League's participation costs associated with travel, insurance and accommodations for the players and their guests, but told the NHL it will not continue to pay for those costs for the 2018 tournament."
1 There are still places to fill the team.  They could turn to players in the other European leagues (Switzerland, Finland, etc), players on AHL-only contracts (as opposed to AHL players on two-way contracts, which aren't eligible), and non-pro players in the junior leagues.
1 The Olympics probably cost the Senators a Cup - Hasek got injured in the year they had far and away the best team in the league.
1 More like they just don't want to take that risk without being compensated for it. 
1 > Owners don't want their star players potentially injured playing hockey for their country.If that was true they wouldnt have tried to jam the World Cup of Hockey down our throats. And a few players did get hurt playing in that.
1 Wow, if football (soccer) clubs thought like that, and didn't allow their players to participate in the world cup or other international tournaments, all hell would break lose. I don't even think that would be legal
1 WHAT ABOUT THE WORLD CUP OF HOCKEY.
1 It didn't actually shorten the season at all. The big issue is the IOC getting all the benefit from having these stars at the Olympics and the NHL was not allowed to use any pictures, video or anything of their players at the Olympics at all.The NHL assumes 100% of the risk and doesn't see a single dime when the IOC makes away like bandits.
1 It’ll be like soccer in the olympics. The major difference is soccer has the World Cup.
1 That's disappointing to hear. I was just thinking that this might still make for some great hockey because I assume we'd just see a lot more junior league players step up, to which Canada has many aspiring. I mean don't get me wrong most hockey is great hockey anyways; I am Canadian after all!. 
1 ehhhhh....
1 College hockey is unwatchable, amirite?
1 Oh rly, what's your favourite sport if I may ask?
1 The miracle team were not the best players in the world..
1 > All the best players from Finland and Sweden play in the NHL or KHL as well.True, but Finland and Sweden still have their own, relatively strong hockey leagues to pull talent from.  With the NHL (including minor league players tethered to an NHL club) and now likely KHL not participating, Canada and the States' options are much more limited.  It might be that Canada actually looks to the junior leagues for players at this point while the States might dip into the college system.
1 I would argue that national pride in your participating athletes is the entire point of the Olympics, regardless of their source.  The World Cup of Hockey is the current venue for the national level all star game and is NHL sanctioned."Miracle on Ice" was played without NHL athletes so passionate athletes can produce compelling and memorable matches without being "the best".
1 Yeah true, but I am very excited for that game!
1 Yeah, that's what I'm going to do with my extra time, too....... *unzip*
1 Nope. You spent it all typing this comment.
1 Yea I think swearing is the only thing in the movie that gave it the MA rating.
1 Yeah, mostly at the beginning IIRC. It kind of starts out as a less serious doc about the director trying to dope himself and then kind of stumbles into this whole thing with Rodchenkov. There are a bunch of scenes of him injecting himself/blood and some language. That's all that could be objectionable, I think.
1 That's because there is no program.  All the witnesses are immediately incinerated. 
1 Well, we wouldn't know, right?
1 Tell us more!
1 Hopefully they maintain that record with a russian puppet in the whitehouse.
1 Challenge accepted.
1 Hey, save some reddit for the rest of us.
1 How would we know if it does fail?
1 Never failed to keep the witnesses deaths hidden. 
1 I thought it had failed but because the witness themselves have fucked up not the program.
1 Well the guy from Goodfellas, Henry Hill, would routinely show up on the Howard Stern show. He didn't really need it after some time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3G8-fQfFCwPS: He's an idiot of a human being.
1 Ah yes, the last high profile American whistleblower is sitting safely at home.. oh wait, no, he ran to Russia.
1 Right because the humane thing to do is throw them into solitary confinement without legal counsel 
1 I think those journalist all committed suicide. With 2 shots to the back of the head. 
1 Well the USA is known for doing that also - they either kill or put your behind bars forever. 
1 They do, they just hide it. Russia on the other hand flaunts it to discourage future occurences.
1 "Why does the rest of the world not like or trust us? What's wrong with everyone else?"
1 witness protection programme
1 Witness protection program. 
1 Witness Protection Program
1 Witness Protection Program
1 Witness protection program
1 Witness Protection Program maybe?
1 Witness Protection Program. Necessary I believe, since two directors of RUSADA (russian anti-doping agency) have died under mysterious circumstances.
1 The Witness Protection Program
1 Witness Protection Program.
1 Maybe not. Americans distrust their government a lot more than Russians (especially now) and people like Snowden were supported by a large number (especially on Reddit)
1 I think the average Russian is pro-Russian, but that doesn't extend to the creepy, corrupt, and dangerous illegal doping ring. There's a difference between liking your home country, and liking corruption. 
1 I'm pro America in the same sense that a parent is pro their kid.  They want their kid to have great opportunities and won't let other people fuck with their kid but at the same time they make sure they aren't fucking up and doing the wrong thing.  It is kind of funny how nationalists don't understand the latter half of this very easy concept.  The nationalists are more like that mom that thinks their kid can't do anything wrong.
1 They would probably just compete as Independent Olympians with the Olympic logo as their flag. It's been done many times before already including in the most recent 2016 games. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Olympians_at_the_Olympic_Games
1 The Greendale HUMANS
1 Khaki
1 Most likely. Or beige. 
1 Maybe just the uniform of whichever sport club they train with? That's what gymnasts, skaters etc usually do in meets where they aren't representing their nation.
1 Each has to prove they are individually clean.
1 You're not wrong.
1 I guess in Russia, the medals own you.
1 > Those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. Although it is unknown exactly how many will clear that bar, it is certain that the contingent from Russia will be depleted significantly.
1 Exactly they're not nationalistic, they're isolationist. There is a big difference.
1 Wrong flag there man
1 It's an odd situation in that they're nationalistic in that they are fiercely loyal to the government based out of Moscow but many of those tendencies are split between an idealization of modern Russia and of the former Soviet Union, which could explain the lack of a single flag becoming a representation of nationalism. 
1 They will presumably be as clean as everyone else, which is to say basically clean, in the word of the great Chael Sonnen.
1 I think thats fair. I'm sure that there are Russian athletes that have never doped, and as long as they are stringently tested I don't see the problem. This is a huge insult to Russia and i'm glad they did it 
1 I guess the athletes have to be invited
1 It won't be, it's a system that's already working in track and field. It's basically Russian athletes who live and train in another country, for example the USA. They are then under the control of the local doping authority rather than the Russian one. 
1 The same group that banned Russia, right?
1 Oh, I thought there were just individual people doping themselves
1 oh ok. I didn't know that
1 *картошка
1 Happens to me every ducking time. And that word is perfect for this.
1 That’s the real competition taking place. Can’t catch me (taking PEDs)!
1 that actually sounds pretty sick
1 I mean, if you watched Sochi, you kind of did.
1 Justice League is an okay movie, too. Just so you know, it fits your criteria of successful movie recommendations.
1 Relevant Simpsons gif: https://frinkiac.com/video/S12E14/B8V0vfVFcFjCpGosyrR6HO4nciU=.gif
1 It's a pretty cool movie. Lots of interesting characters.
1 Seems like a troll. It was a very bad movie and got a lot of shit when it came out. Those are the dark Night years.
1 [I want to see what he'll say next.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G6xu-J_Dmc)
1 Is it wrong that he gives me an erection?
1 Vhatever he hits, he destroy!
1 But then again who does?
1 yeah but those were all non-nuclear states
1 i never said he wasn't. people are blaming him for Olympiads doping. 
1 Its military and its scientific achievements and its geopolitical influence made it a superpower. In all of these sectors Putin's Russia is nothing compared to the USSR at its height 
1 The USSR had a fuck ton of massive flaws but it was absolutely a superpower, it was the second biggest economy in the world, the first nation in space, had a truly enormous landmass and global reach, Putin has spent all this time and effort trying to retake 2 or 3% of what they lost when the USSR collapsed.I don't know how young to have to be to think that the USSR wasn't a bigger power, it was in fact one of two superpowers. 
1 Which doesn't really help the original guy's assertion that Putin somehow made Russia a world power. They've had nukes for a while now, before Putin was even born probably. All he's done is help tank their economy by provoking western sanctions. It's pretty sad that a country as historically and culturally relevant as Russia is still living under a dictatorship. The Russian people deserve better than Putin, much better.
1 Some power sure, but they had that before Putin.
1 They had as much geopolitical influence as any nation not named the US.  
1 The USSR was MUCH more of a world power relatively than Russia is today. It's not even a conversation, either you know this or you're straight up delusional.Their relative share of the world economy was greater. Their relative share of world manufacturing was greater. Their expenditure on defense was greater. They supported friendly regimes worldwide to pursue their interests. They competed in the space race against the US. Today what is Russia? In every respect, today's Russia is weaker than the USSR. They're less respected on the world stage. Their military is weaker. Their GDP is the size of fucking Italy. Russia today is only a threat to it's weaker neighbors. You think France or Germany or China really take Russia nearly as seriously as they did in cold war times? The USA especially is almost recklessly lax regarding a nuclear power like Russia compared to before the Soviet collapse. 
1 I think a few of the miracle team were juicing, It's just that it probably wasn't a conspiracy. They just wanted to perform better so a few cheated. I doubt it goes any deeper than that. 
1 It’s sad that I had to actually check his Twitter to make sure this was fake 
1 Crooked investigators (like the ones who won't go after crooked Hillary) bared fine respectable athletes from competing because of accusations of doping, which is FAKE NEWS. Sad!
1 But where does that kind of thinking stop. If everyone was less proud of their countries for doing systematically bad things then no one could possibly have any pride in any country at this point. 
1 Which in all honesty would be very very rare in this case.
1 Yeah they've already hinted at a boycott if the ban was going to happen. This has been a possibility for awhile now, so it's not a giant surprise. But fun fact, the dude who was instrumental in orchestrating the scam in the labs is banned for life from the Olympics, AND is in charge of the 2018 World Cup in Russia! I'm sure that will be 100% above board 
1 If I don't survive, tell my wife, hello.
1 Probably not state sponsored though. Though with the way things are going with our current administration nothing would surprise me anymore. 
1 The McLaren report was published before Rio, it's why their Athletics team was banned. The IOC just didn't have the guts to ban Russia weeks before the opening ceremonies.
1 Track & Field was banned by the governing body of that sport, not the Olympic Committee.
1 WADA recommended banning Russia and the IOC didn't. Seems pretty weak to me, but it's all subjective.
1 the Russians/Soviets have always been dominant in ice skating - hence why they became coaches for American teamsalso living in a country that's covered in ice for months at a time will just naturally lead to people excelling in that field
1 This is a time of rampant greed.
1 Makes your hands shake less.
1 Both. They like being fit, but it also has won them points quite often. When you can sweep hard enough that rocks travel an extra 2-3 inches after a collision, that's massive.
1 AHL players on minor league contracts can go to the Olympics. AHL players on NHL contracts cannot go. 
1 the european leagues in Sweden and Finland are very competitve.  they would most likely shit all over a team of NCAAers, especially on the big ice surface
1 Sweden free win
1 Knucklepuck time
1 FUCK YEAH. 
1 Gotta convince coach bombay to come out of retirement though 
1 I mean, obviously? That's not really a negative thing. 
1 They do care about injuries but it is definitely 2nd behind money
1 I'd be curious if they do this for basketball, seems like the NHL and NBA should be in similar situations. 
1 Hard to tell, you'd have to compare similar league contact sports. Maybe football... Is football an Olympic sport? 
1 Most pro sports don't have to shut down their season, mid season for the Olympics though. Big difference.
1 In soccer, this is done through FIFA, who cover insurance (payable to clubs) for players participating in national team duty at FIFA sanctioned events, of which the Olympics is one. However, it's a bit different of a situation than the NHL providing insurance the insurance, which would be to themselves, and therefore wouldn't make as much sense.
1 The IOC doesnt run its tournaments during any other pro leagues regular season.  Its why baseball isnt in the summer olympics.      The IOC also refused to allow the NHL to use any clips or media from the games.  so the NHL is supposed to send its players to korea, let them beat themselves up in the middle of the season risking injury which could dmg ratings back home, swallow any medical costs related to injury, AND not be able to use any of the footage, whatsoever, to promote your players when they get back?  meanwhile the IOC is literally pocketing billions of dollars?      yea, its totally all on the NHL.
1 Not at a spectator event level
1 Not an American, and I get their viewpoint. Tough shit.
1 > Players are competitors and the Olympics are one of the greatest thing a competitor could participate in. Not too many professionals see it that way though.  There is some pride for the country they qualify to play for but they're seeing better teams every night from mixed squads.
1 Da FUq? That's the dumbest thing I ever read. The IOC and sports are about generating entertainment business not "love" of the game. They always have been about making money. 
1 God forbid they want to protect their investments.
1 Injuries happen. Hell Hasek could have pulled a groin getting out of the bath tub, or in practice. 
1 Ah, I guess I remembered wrong, I knew they took a break but I guess they made up the games later. 
1 We've got Bettman's World Cup of Hockey though which is totally the exact same thing and definitely doesn't suck compared to actual Olympic hockey
1 So does hockey, but instead of having hundreds of nations try to qualify, the NHL simply chose six and added two gimmick teams full of the rest the world to make 8.It was probably the worst hockey tournament ever.
1 There´s no World cup for Hockey?
1 Soccer in the olympics is more interesting than the world cup typically though. Only being allowed 3 (or whatever the number is) veteran players completely changes who the powerhouse teams are.
1 Beer helps.
1 No, but when you're used to watching the world's best players competing in the world's premiere international tournament, it's schmucky to insinuate that having a bunch of minor leaguers and college kids replacing them will be just as fun to watch. 
1 i mean, pretty much yeah.  
1 That was also 40 years ago lol
1 Which is why the Summit Series was much better
1 Those relatively strong european leagues are full of all the second tier north american players as well. I dunno. I feel like without the NHL (and KHL if they don't join) the olympics is essentially just the Spengler Cup with a few rearranged teams.. And Canada does just fine at the Spengler Cup so I'm not sure I buy an argument that the favorites change at all without NHL and KHL players.
1 The minor leagues players can go to the olympics this year, but only if they have a contract with the minors and not one with the major but are only in the minors for whatever reason. I think there are a few players who play NHL on a minor contract for the reason of being able to go to the Olympics this year. [Here is a hockey news article about it](http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/players-on-ahl-contracts-can-head-to-olympics-here-are-eight-candidates)
1 No, lol there won't be CHL or NCAA players. They'll just be Canadians/Americans from Russia, Sweden, Finland, and the AHL. 
1 Miracle on Ice is so compelling exactly because the Red Army team *was* the best International team. If Russia's team wasn't arguably one of the greatest international teams ever than beating them isn't the "miracle on ice" for America.
1 What are you gonna do with the extra 15 seconds?
1 Rar... waiting for decompression is always a waste of time.
1 Balefire?
1 Well, that would certainly be a way to go about it
1 So they take "burning an asset" quite literally?
1 It's more of an *existential* protection than it is *literal* protection
1 Fair point. How many Jane Does were WP protectionees? 
1 My new neighbor J. American Joeguy died in his garage yesterday. Evidently he fell backwards onto the tablesaw that got delivered by Genuine Baltic Table Saws Inc. while he was bathing. Terrible shame. He seemed so averagely nondescript. 
1 There's a fairly significant difference between jailing a whistleblower for violating existing laws and outright killing them. 
1 But not because he would be killed, but because he would be found guilty of treason. 
1 He's not Russian though. That's the difference. 
1 Chelsea Manning was held in solitary confinement for years, through multiple suicide attempts. 
1 How is that even relevant
1 I'd rather have 7 years in prison like Chelsea Manning than life in Russia.
1 You really think that's a logical thought?  Putin would whack any fucking journalist or govt whistleblower in a nanosecond, if it's against his own self interests and they're Russian and in Russia.  He's not gonna whack american whistleblowers who directly shit all over the US and make us look terrible, because that directly and materially serves his own interests.
1 Chelsea Manning spent 5 years in jail, but it's alive and now it's a free woman. 
1 Are you trying to say that Russia doesn't have a horrible well deserved reputation for killing whistleblowers and journalists? Are the human rights watchdogs wrong about them?I don't get the point of your whataboutism. 
1 I'll take solitary over polonium, thanks.  That said, USA is also only one country.  If your best defense of Russia is "but it's still way better to be the worst-treated whistleblower in the USA" then I'm not sure where you're headed.
1 That's a waterboardin'.
1 “and you are lynching negros”
1 No friend you don't understand. They get an all expenses paid trip to Cuba or a cruise through international waters brought to you by the United States Coast Guard!  
1 No evidence of US outright murdering whistle blowers, but they sure as fuck try to jail the shit out of them. 
1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_ManningForever == 5 years.
1 Ah the good old two shot suicide
1 An average Russian thinks that this scandal is made up. There are two main positions that most people have in mind. Some think that doping is an endemic thing (and leaks by Fancy Bears about Serena Williams are but a glimpse on what is actually happening for every country)Some think that Rodchenkov is a criminal that was about to get caught and chose to find a safe haven in exchange for participating in a fake process. Most think that both positions are valid simultaneously. 
1 SOUND THE BEIGE ALERT.And if I don't survive, tell my wife hello.
1 These individual athletes were testing clean before and getting past the system. We only know about the doping because of whistle-blowers.Lance Armstrong never failed a test in his career either.
1 Or bribe the testers. But nobody would do that...
1 It's the 75th anniversary of the battle of Stalingrad. When it comes to WW2 the Russians are Nationalistic. Millions died and they didn't give up, and won. If the Russians gave up after suffering what the French did we would be speaking German.
1 Did I just assumed your nationality?
1 Great opportunity for supplemental income!
1 brings new meaning to the term ladyboner though.
1 It smells like r/movies here...
1 Living In America!!
1 "They totally deny it!"
1 And what's the problem with that? Why should anyone have pride in a country that systematically does bad things? What the hell are you even proud about? The US has done some pretty fucked up things and I am not proud of my country because of how it treats its lowest social class. Am I just supposed to act like I'm proud of the country anyways because of this ridiculous concept of blind nationalism? No thank you.
1 This was a "systematically bad thing" directly related to sport. So how about it stops at bad things directly related to sport....?
1 You take the good with the bad, I guess.  I have some pretty mixed feelings about the US for example and am deeply ashamed of us for a lot of reasons right now but overall I think we're a positive global force for technological innovations, international peace-keeping and promoting human rights, despite some obvious crimes and missteps.
1 If you country is disproportionately currently doing systematically bad things, you probably shouldn't be proud of it. You should work to change it
1 Blind pride in your country no matter what it does or has done or will do in the future is a very, very bad thing.
1 Your country is not just your politicians, it's your people too. 
1 Read what you just wrote. Now read it slower a second time. Now evener slowwwwer a third time. Ok. Get why that's a problem? Good.
1 This is the only time something like this worked out. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_OlympicsMaybe they try something to this effect again? 
1 I'm thinking in terms of hockey but I may be completely wrong with this but I thought nhl drug tested the players so chances are they wouldn't have a problem
1 Russia or not Fifa is always above board /s/
1 I think there were reasons, but yeah I agree with that.  Thought the report was released in Dec 2016?
1 Wasn't there a couple athletes who ended up competing for another country?
1 Sounds fun to me!
1 Some of the colleges play on Olympic sized ice. St cloud state for sure does. 
1 Yea I was just thinking both Sweden and Finland have their own leagues with plenty of talent.Congrats to both for the top two spots. Nothing gets the crowd riled up like an entire tournament playing for bronze amiriteguise
1 I believe basketball does it. Let me check. It seems each country pays for insurance for its basketball players if it does. I believe France did it in 2016. http://nba.nbcsports.com/tag/nba-insurance
1 American football is not AFAIK, we're the only ones who play it. That's why the super bowl winners are referred to as "world" champions.
1 It is, but it's not that big. 
1 I think soccer does that though, both for olympics and for the world cup? I could be wrong about that though not a big soccer fan.
1 In hockey, European players value Olympic gold medals over everything, while north Americans put a Stanley cup above the gold medal. Team strength doesn't matter, it's that you're representing the country you grew up in and all your friends, family, and nieghbors over just yourself. 
1 It depends how much you enjoy the sport. I think the World Junior Championships are the funnest games you can watch aside from the Cup playoffs. Sometimes less than perfect hockey is more exciting.
1 > I feel like without the NHL (and KHL if they don't join) the olympics is essentially just the Spengler Cup The Spengler Cup also has KHL players too, so in that regard we could see a sub-Spengler Cup roster from Team Canada in the Olympics.
1 > The minor leagues players can go to the olympics this year, but only if they have a contract with the minors and not one with the major but are only in the minors for whatever reason. I understand that, that's why I added the "players tethered to an NHL club" qualifier.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  But yes, players on AHL-only contracts are eligible, those on two-way contracts are not.
1 Team Canada was going to feature a lot of players from the KHL, but now that might not be practical.  As for AHL players, those on two-way contracts can't participate, only those on AHL-only contracts, so the pool of eligible minor league players aren't great.Players in other European leagues are an option though.
1 Sit here, eat my orange, and think of a witty response to your question
1 Jerk it again?
1 Got him! How will his manhood and self of self ever recover???
1 watch?
1 Cry
1 The end result is the same on society - their message and ability to participate/contribute is removed. I don't think a country should get a pass because it "imprisons forever" instead of just kills someone. 
1 He has yet to be caught, hence he is alive and well. Also, ever heard of a place in USA called Guantanamo? Where torture is daily routines and no court of law needed? 
1 And then commit suicide by repeatedly shooting himself in the back of the head 
1 Also, because unlike most Russian whistleblowers, Snowden acted in the interests of the Russian government.
1 ...the penalty for which is death. Reminds me of the scarecrow scene from the TDKR
1 He's trying to say that being locked in solitary confinement for the rest of your life without legal counsel isn't far off death; I dare say I agree.
1 >Are you trying to say that Russia doesn't have a horrible well deserved reputation for killing whistleblowers and journalists?Specify where he said that? You are just creating strawmen out of of thin air now. Pathetic. 
1 That isn't what he is saying. The point is that both Russia and the US (as well as just about every country on Earth) punitively mistreat whistleblowers, so it seems hypocritical to highlight Russia's human rights violations when we do the same or similar things. 
1 Methinks you don't realize just how bad solitary confinement is
1 You have NOT BEEN IN SOLITARY THENIt is hell. 
1 Russia doesn't officially has death sentence. USA does. When Snowden still was at airport USA was asked to provide assurances that Snowden wouldn't get a death sentence nothing of sort were provided and it was one of the reasons why Russia couldn't send Snowden off to USA.
1 Right, but we can only do what we can do.
1 to be fair, he did fail a test. They then retroactively wrote a TUE and paid the UCI a fee to have it forgotten (sorry a charitably donation that had nothing to do with it)
1 But these athletes are right now being tested by not-russian laboratories just so they can compete. With that all the tests are being kept in freezers for a long time. Just recently we had a case in my country (Slovenia) where a biathlon (cross country skiing) athlete was positive for doping in a sample from 2010 olympics in Vancouver 
1 If it was that easy, don’t you think Russia would’ve done it for the last Olympics instead of all the shame they went through?
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZSpBZxjGW0
1 This is the kind of thing that the Russians are going to say. "We were banned for not bribing the testers, like everyone else does."
1 Individual athletes likely wouldn't have the sway or money to bribe the testers - not like Russia would.
1 But no dude boners.
1 People are proud of what there country represents as a whole and what it has accomplished. If you have a problem with national pride, don't go telling other people that they shouldn't be proud. 
1 The NHL drug testing program doesn't seem very robust and should be easy to get around. You wouldnt even need to get fancy with microdosing with how infrequently they test.
1 Which is why I said in this case, the NHL already pulled out of the Olympics, though what you are saying is of course 100% correct. 
1 The report was published in two parts, one part before Rio and one part after.
1 Minnesota will enter as their own country for this. 
1 I was being a little sassy about the football part. I'm not sure there is another sport like hockey we can compare to. As far as I know, for most Olympic sports, winning an Olympic medal is the top achievement. 
1 For me it all depends on what you go in expecting. I love hockey in many forms, but when I go see an NHL game, I want NHL quality. When I go see an AHL game, I know I'm not getting NHL quality.I'm not taking anything away from World Juniors, the Frozen Four, or anything like that. I'm just saying that in this specific format (the Olympic Men's ice hockey tournament), there are certain expectations now. 
1 Dat refractory period tho 
1 A trial and legal execution. Not an 'accident' or 'suicide'. The difference is due process and the rule of law and possibly most importantly the lack of some ominous cloud over society that you must not do anything against the government whether technically legal or not, which serves to keep people from questioning authority.
1 He wouldn't actually be found guilty of treason but of the espionage act. Treason is defined in the Constitution in a way that makes it almost impossible to prosecute anyone who doesn't literally go to war against the U.S.
1 Holy shit you write like Boris Badenov speaks.  What is Natasha up to these days?  It's nice to see you have a job as a Russian troll on Reddit.  What does that pay?  Probably better than that moose and squirrel show you were on.
1 You're right. We shouldn't punish innocent athletes and there isn't a perfect solution.
1 Do you think they *didn't* spend millions on exactly that while trying to cover the program up?
1 Yes nhl has pulled out but Russian players were planning on going anyway. Ovechkin had permision from his owner to go and he wasn't the only player
1 For sure. I'm saying for the casual fan that probably wouldn't notice the differences between and NHL and ECHL level game, they should really give it a chance. The games will most likely be a lot more wide open and less defensively sound due to the skillset of the players, short time getting familiar with line mates, and less involved coaching, it's gonna lead to some barn burners. The names and faces will be less recognizable but the hockey itself will be memorable.
1 Doesn't make it right though. 
1 They might spend. But the fact that it didn’t work disproves your statement.
1 And doesn’t *this* prove that that doesn’t necessarily work? You’re fighting against your own argument here. 
1 Gotta admit I didn't know that, interesting to see it wasn't simply all of the NHL players not being present.
1 Olympic people said, if NHL pulls out, then even if Ovechkin wants to play, he still can't participate. Ovechkin already issued a statement saying that if he was allowed by Olympic Federation to play he would, but Russian Team literally can't even invite him, nhl will be not participating as a whole. 
1 This is untrue. He did have permission from his owner, but he's made a statement that he's not going to challenge the NHL decision
1 it didnt work because the head of their doping program jumped ship and blew the whistle on everyone
1 My point is that they're still going to try.
1 My argument is they're still going to try the same shit, given the chance.
1 and our point is they wont be able to succeed. therefore the ones that do compete ARE actually clean.
3428 Hey guys|girls,This is me. It's a bit weird (and off-topic) to see me on /r/europe.Ask me anything, I guess.PS: I did not create VLC. I joined the Ecole Centrale Paris in 2003, and I've been leading the project since 2007. I created the VideoLAN non-profit though :)PPS: not my best photo
3431 Rather than wondering how we can make more people built privacy breaking, data monetising, tax evading giants like Facebook, maybe we should be wondering how we can support people like him.
649 Btw, the name is an acronym from Very Large Cone. I know that there are people trying to push other versions but don't let them fool you. This picture clearly shows the truth.
153 Just the other day I opened VLC and was like "The volume on this goes *over* 100.  I love VLC."Thanks, Jean-Baptiste.  
106 ping u/jbkempf
65 Goddamn what a champion. I bet you the majority of people will sell out as soon that amount was offered. 
121 His first name is Jean-Baptiste, it's a double-barrelled firstname.
53 He did an AMA on r/France not too  long ago.   He is just as awesome as he looks in this picture.   [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/)'s the link for those who are interested and can understand french. 
83 I love his hat.
19 VLC BAISE OUAIS.
18 Massive respect!
18 I’m immediately going to VLC’s website and will donate what I can to the project led by Jean. I hope there are tens of millions of people who do the the same (even if a million users just donate €1, it is a win). Thanks Jean.
14 [He did an AMA a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/)
14 If you use VLC you should go to their site and donate if you can. I've been using this thing for probably a decade, and they deserve my money at least.
10 Merci beaucoup, Jean!
10 He's a Hero, he saved me from Windows Media player!
10 TIL VLC started in France!
1 VLC is the best media player ever. You could throw anything at that program and it's going to play no problem. I once even used VLC player to play the Recycle Bin.
7 VLC always gets an upvote from me
6 My favorite video player of all times.
8 The real MVP.
20 A real hero. 
12 This man is god !
6 Definitely more likeable than Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.
4 Mein Kempf! 
6 Been using VLC for years because it can even play some corrupted files. Worthy a donation: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html
6 I always wonder how VLC makes money.
15 Does not work like that. It would be forked not 45 mins after such a move and that is why open source software is so resilient.
5 I think him!
6 Dzięki, Jean!
5 Now these people are worthy of statues. Like Jonas Salk.
3 Merci monsieur Jean-Baptiste! 💜
6 The First thing i do after installing a fresh copy of windows is set VLC as my defualt player. runs everything i throw at it.
5 Merci, Jean!
9 This is a good man, I approve
4 Thank you sir for this outstanding free media player! 
4 Merci from Folkestone, UK 
1 This mans morals must be very high because I would sell out without hesitation for a few million
1 r/humansbeingbros
1 VLC is good, though I usually prefer MPC-HC. Got both installed anyway.
3 Get that man a cookie
3 This guy did an AMA on r/france, it's a really cool guy haha
3 Thank you jean-baptiste 🤘
3 We need to donate to this man
3 God tier human! 
3 If only redditor praises were a widely accepted currency, people might actually be able to live off doing stuff like this!
3 Merci from Mexico, Jean!
2 VLC is the best video player hands down. It works 99.99% of the time.
3 Didn't he also get donations form EU just now? Good for this guy! VLC is SO great
3 A while back, I torrented a couple porn movies that have become my favorite porns of all time. When I downloaded them, they weren't in a format QuickTime could play. After some googling, I discovered I needed VLC. VLC allowed me to watch the best porn series ever. Good on you, VLC. 
2 VLC is probably the single best program I have installed on every computer I have owned since it came out years ago. There have been other things, but VLC is pretty much the only one that has been great all along. No ads, no extra bullshit getting added with each iteration, just a quality media player that always does just what we need it to. 
3 I respect him. I would've taken the money.
3 Merci, Jean!
3 Thanks :) 
3 One of, if not the best open-source programs on the net. Merci indeed.
3 God, I love open source software.
2 Instead of just giving upvotes, you can donate here:https://www.videolan.org/contribute.html

1 Merci :D
1 Merci from Poland! :)
1 VLC is like a post gone viral!....//I've seen it on roads construction, several of them and vehicles go round it. Respect man!!!
4 Even though these days I prefer MPC-HC for my PC video playing needs, you can't ignore the impact that VLC had on user-friendly widely compatible desktop media players.     EDIT: I'm curious as to why I was downvoted. I was supporting this guys impact on media players despite acknowledging that I don't personally prefer VLC these days. Not mad, I'd just like some explanation.
2 and we all love VLC because of that too. Thank you!
2 Love this guy, wish that others would follow his lead... I'm talking to you Ajit Pai...
2 thanks!
2 Ge also believes in safety, as noted, by his headwear,
2 Hero!
2 Thanks a bunch, Jean-Baptiste.I know myself and I would have taken the money like a fool, no question about it. I'm happy that all people aren't as shitty as me.
2 He knew no one would use it if it had ads.
2 Mad props!
2 Wearing a traffic cone hat
2 The Cone of Fame
1 VLC is open source no? If someone put ads in it it would just be forked again without ads. I would have taken the money lol.
1 Stupid...
1 Huh. I was wondering why this looked familiar: I took that photo in Berlin, during the QtCon 2016.Good to see u/jbkempf  and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) getting some love outside the Free Software bubble. I had the opportunity of talking to him live and he told me how they have to fight off patent trolls and aggressive copyright lawyers all the time. He also told me a fun story about the beginning of the project.[We made a transcript and posted it here](http://www.ocsmag.com/2015/07/17/vlc-an-interview-with-jean-baptiste-kempf/).
1 I do love VLC and used it for years but recently discovered IINA and actually like it more. [Link to IINA github page (for macOS)](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/)
1 I'm just realizing now how I take VLC for granted.. Gone are the days of downloading a million codecs in a in hope to play some video I torrented..  It's always one of the first things I installed whenever I reinstall windows.. I haven't been this loyal to a piece of software since winamp as original  my music player way back in a day... Beer money coming right up.
1 I like the cut of his jib 
1 VLC media player still has some problems though with playing videos sometimes.That's why I use MPV player and have never looked back.
1 Respect!I do hope you have enough money by other means!Thank for making VLC, btw.
1 HERO.
1 Merci Jean !
1 People like you are what the internet needs.
1 I would like to see more of this type of recognition on reddit. Good people doing good work that helps us all. I love VLC and install it on every new PC I get. Merci Jean.
1 Which Hogwarts house was he put in?
1 Dude’s ole school. This ain’t nuthin new for him 
1 When is Christmas cap going to show up?
1 I thought that VLC player had been hijacked by the CIA and was used for spying
0 MPC-HC is 1000x better tbqh
1 "RAVENCLAW!" shouted the hat.
1 I'm not good with commitment but last week I started using vlc as my default program for a lot of file formats. 
1 Is great player - ty, sir
1 I think it is a very good idea to support people & foundations like this in times like these (EA etc.):https://www.videolan.org/contribute.htmlPS: They also accept Bitcoin. :)
1 VLC got me through some hard times when videos werent so easily accessible online. Dark days indeed. 
1 JB is a BAMF.
1 Go ger that money dude!! Guala guala
1 He definitely looks like that
0 Hail Satan, Friend.
1 I'm a professional videographer and I use his technology every day. Thanks for making my job easier Jean!
1 Jean-Baptiste has done more to refine my movie watching experience than many. Thanks, Jean-Baptiste!
1 I use this program every day for my workouts.  Thank you so very much to this guy - what a king!
0 This is stupid, it’s open sourced and would fork faster than you could blink if they tried to monetize it. That’s the whole point of open source software, you CAN’T monetize it.
1 This man has given me the ability to watch media from around the world for like 20 years or something. Thanks so much VLC guy! We would be so less cultured without you! You the real MVP!
0 Modern hero right there
0 not all heroes wear capes
1 You sure he isn’t a Glaswegian with that hat on? 
1 😃 great stuffs
1 So EU is paying him a fuckton. That's almost better
1 Thank you Jean-Baptiste!! You are one of our heroes!!
1 Hero 
1 Thank you from America (I'm sorry). 
1 PM your PayPal email! Thanks x
1 Sir, you are amazing. 
1 Hey /u/CopperOtter,This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
1 Merci beaucoup!
1 This guy deserves a medal! 
1 Aweome JBK!!! I use VLC to watch all my videos. you do great work.
1 Good guy Jean! Don't use VLC much anymore but that's because I don't often launch videos from outside Plex. 
1 Been using vlc for a couple years by far the best media player glad it will remain ad free and maleware free unlike most good softwares that get corrupted by big business and money
1 he is anti freedom. https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=48356 does not allow you to run VLC as the root account easily.
1 Can technology save the world？
1 What if I was to offer him hundreds of millions? 
1 Modern day HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 Loved VLC but ended up uninstalling it due to its version update process. Every few weeks there’d be an update and you’d have to confirm where you want it installed and then in what language. As if you’d change these things for a version update. I think I last counted that it involved 16 mouse clicks just to get the freakin’ update!  I’d rather have ads than do that 
1 Why? Unless he's already making crazy money, why would he turn that down?
1 Thank you, Jean-Baptiste! 
1 All just a well thought on plan to justify one day wearing that hat 
1 Not all hero’s wear capes. Some wear orange traffic cones
1 Go Jean! I use VLC every day!!
1 God Bless you Jean-Baptiste Kempf You are a precious and a rare specie... 
1 Cold blooded.
1 he should take the offer for a years advertising and then cancel everything and save the money. 
1 Is that the neon sorting hat？I want a turn！
1 This guy. I love him so much. That cone hat is fucking hilarious. We need more people like him for sure.
1 Hero !
1 ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 
1 bless this man. many wont remember what it was like to download a movie and be unable to watch it because you didn't have the right codex. HOURS of downloading (sometimes days) and guess what? you still can't watch that video! VLC is truly one of mans greatest achievements in the modern era.
1 A true hero 
1 In a world where we had a software market, guys like Jean-Baptiste wouldn't need a day job.  But for some reason, ~~Reddit~~ the people who would benefit most from a vibrant commercial software market are also the ones who most vehemently oppose paying for their tools.   They're also the ones who bitch the loudest because they can't find a programming job.   
1 Only a true hero like yourself would deny creating VLC
1 Today's Hero
1 Look at all of the happy Europeans here, not worried about Net Neutrality. Be more like Europe, America.
1 Donation coming right up
1 I ran across VLC a few years ago and love it.
1 Good guy! I’ve always been fond of VLC
1 I love you
1 Merci you beautiful motherfucker
1 Us Europeans stick to our principles!
1 Thanks my dude. I don't know if you're also responsible for that, but I love VLSub
1 VLC is super useful for all things video.  Thanks Jean!
1 Anyone remember KMP? It used to be good but they totally sold out and ruined their product. I still occasionally download 10 year old versions of it; it did everything. 
1 Do you pronounce it Jean on Gean?
1 Even if they did accept ads VLC is open source so someone could just fork it and make a vlc ad free version ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
1 Merci Jean.
1 So that's were ads come from?Wow... This guy did some brave shit👏👏👏
1 Thank you jean-baptiste.
1 But everything changed when the Apple nation attacked 
1 I have such a love hate with VLC. But it beats out basically every other media player.
1 On a side note. Jean, could you guys get your development team to fix the cropping feature that's broken on 2.2.6? Been on 2.2.4 for as long as I can remember.
1 da real mvp
1 Merci ! 
1 thanks french software designer seth rogen 
1 Love love love VLC! Been using it for years and years. Huge thank you!
1 I try to get my son to play his DVDs on VLC, but he keeps using Windows Media Player.  Well, we were playing a game in the background, and WMP scrambled his saved game somehow.  VLC is kilometers ahead of Microsoft.
1 Legend!!!
1 what a guy! I would have definitely sold you all out to the ad people for tens of millions.
1 VLC is my goto player, although I prefer to watch my movies nicely sorted in my KODI media center
1 VLC is great.The recent update to the android version fixed most of my pet peeves with that version.I hope he gets to enjoy some free beer in France.
1 I love you, congratulation, keep up the amazing work, you are awesome <3 <3 <3 <3
1 700 odd comments.Nearly 27K votes.What fake agenda are you pushing OP? Slimeballs. The lot of them.He refused "tens of millions of EUROS". oooo
1 anytime someone has trouble with video i tell them to download VLC.
1 I love this guy
1 These kind of developers are heroes 🙏🙌<3
1 The VLC label says can cause hallucinations? lol
1 Thank you sir!
1 Marryy mee dudeee lol😂
1 A [Translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/dnogswg/) on why* VLC is a cone.
1 Not all heroes wear capes, sometimes they wear....uh....funny hats.
1 Good for him! I would have accepted the money, invest it somehow in real estate, stocks, prostitutes, maybe drugs, anything... what does he do for a living? 
1 [Jean-Baptiste Kempf but cooler.](https://i.imgur.com/EVilmUU.png)
1 Donated to the VLAN site. Only fair since I have been using your software for over a decade...
1 nPlayer is better on iOS though
1 Can you imagine ads built into the video player though
1 MPC-HC is better. 
-2 What an idiot lol 
1 He sounds like a fucking idiot.
-1 Fuck that 
-10 MPC is twenty times better. 
-11 Wha is the problem on profiting on ones work?
-1 But has he sold out his fellow VLCians and his country to the FCC?
1 Would be nice if it didn't crash so much. 
1 >What is the problem on profiting on ones work?>>There's no problem, it's just that not doing it makes him a great person. Being poor instead of rich makes you a good person.lmfao, if only being a good person put food on the table.
1 Why does he have a traffic cone on his head?
1 Had no idea creator of VLC wasn't American.
1 But it installed adware when I updated it
1 too bad it's shit compared to MPC-HC
1 Media Player Classic is better
1 Meh, MPC is better.
-18 So dumb. Take the 10 million and then fucking fork it.. This is the most stupid decision in the history of decisions. It's open source.. 
1 Reddit with its daily meaningless pat on the back.
1 that's a very stupid thing to do
-5 is he the pedophile louis ck was talking about?
-12 As a VLC user,I would rather prefer that he would have gotten the money and put ads in it.We shouldn't be ashamed of monetizing our work(unless you are like EA,then you should die a thousand deaths)
1 Are you kidding me?I fucking hate this guy.
-8 Anyone who refuses millions is a fucking douche
630 Just wanted to drop in and say thank you for all you've done with VLC, loving it <3
139 Where can I get a hat like that?
96 People like you are what the internet needs.
149 I don't have any questions. VLC's been my go-to media player since the mid-2000s, all thanks to the work you and the others in the project do. So, thanks for that!
85 Why haven’t you monetized/milked the vlc player?Thank you for creating this amazing player!
59 An half naked women can get 1000 likes, but how many for our VLC boy in blue on r/Europe?
1 > PPS: not my best photoThanks! </s>(I took the photo)
10 What has been the best part about working in this project?
7 Awesome work for all these years!  Isn't developing such long-term project draining? How do you still find energy to continue doing this for over a decade?
7 What is the main thing about being non-profit and open source that drives you every day to work on vlc?PS: ty <3
5 💟💟💟
5 What is a good photo of you? 
6 What's your favourite dinosaur?
6 Regardless, merci beaucoup!! 
8 No question to ask, I just want to thank you for your contributions.
4 thank you from the bottom of my heart, not much to add
4 That is your best photo, by a mile. 
1 Hey man, thanks so much for supporting a tool that makes life easy for so many people at no cost. I'm an online grad student and it's my favorite way to watch my lectures at exactly the speed I want to. Oh, and thanks for delivering us from Windows Media Player hell :)
4 > PPS: not my best photoshow us your best photo, then!
8 Also, did you use your software to watch porn? 
4 What does VLC actually stand for?
2 Only a true hero like yourself would deny creating VLC 
2 Are you going to support Acestream at some point?
2 Man, thanks for all what you've done.
2 Hello,When will VLC for windows support Chromecast?ty
2 Any story behind the traffic cone as a logo? It's quite distinctive.
1 Thank you for being a good example and providing me with the tools to watch an MKV when I had no idea what I that was.
1 If I was in the position between earning a stable salary and being a millionaire even if that meant ruining my rep I would probably take the millions since people forget and get over stuff fast...What keeps you so pure? 
3 How often do you get “Mein Kempf” jokes?
1 You are the saint of the internet now. We just need a more saintly photo shop of this current photo and you wearing a robe. 
1 What are your thoughts on net neutrality? To you think the net will get more capitalized in the future?
0 Thank you for your program and your work. On this international day of the volunteer (your day) you should treat yourself and the other volunteers at VLC. One question though. Is there an easy way to just cast any video on my pc to my old samsung smart tv easy? Not fidling with ip adresses and such? 
0 Wait. It's non profit so what else do you do for a living?
1 What do you think about the web DRM standard EME?
1 I use VLC since 10+ years, hats off to everyone involved and keeping it really free!Please consider setting up a bitcoin wallet to donate to, Paypal is evil^^Regards and a huge THANK YOU to Paris!
1 Will you be adding support for VR soon?
1 Can't be surprised you're a Redditor ;P
1 Thanks for what you have done for this world :)
1 In hindsight, is there anything you would do differently now regarding the VLC project?
1 thank mr kempf
1 Thank you, keep up the good work!
1 How did you find the time/get others? to find the time to work on a project where there was no real motivation other than to create the software itself in a market where there are plenty of paid versions (where developers are earning money) which do what VLC set out to do? — albeit usually not as well as VLC)From the millions of users, thank you. Your software is unimaginably useful and it’s great that it’s remained free. Up until now I took this for granted.
1 What would be the best way to donate money to you? I want to support people who take a stand like this!
1 Can you tell the story behind versions being named after Discworld characters?
1 ~~Hats~~ cones off to you, monsier!
1 I wouldn't have been able to watch this many movies effortlessly without your application! You've provided me happiness
1 OMG- Seriously. You are too humble.
1 Thanks man!
1 Why does VLC have a delay when I adjust the volume slider 
1 It's awesome how the VLC logo changes around this time of year... do you plan on adding anymore ... Like Halloween cone. Like a witch's hat <;) 
1 > PPS: not my best photoCe n'est pas vrai! La photo est magnifique!But really, thanks for all the work you've done for VLC!
1 Thank you for your service
1 Just wanted to say thank you. I'll be requesting my parents make a donation in lieu of a Christmas present. 
1 Just wanted to compliment you with your project! And for VLC, it's always ticked whenever I go to ninite.com or help people out with their computer. Great work!
1 Will you lot be hanging out at FOSDEM?
1 Thank you :3
1 > Ask me anything, I guess.How much did you pay for the Sorting Hat skin? :)
1 Since I tried many players and only VLC worked, I want to say big thank you for keeping the player way it is right now: stable, not BSODing my pc, and being everything for any kind person: that just HAS to fiddle with every setting to make it right or for a person that just wants to install it and watch something right away without any problems.<3
1 How does VLC make money?
1 Refused millions to keep away ads. You didn't have to do that, but you did anyway. My hero!
1 Vlc best media player ever. You've been my go to gor the past 6 years. Thank you guys for all the seemless movie watching nights. 👊
1 VLC is awesome. How many hours per week do you spend on it. What’s your full time job if this isn’t it. Do you find it harder and harder to be support such a popular open source project as this with little to no compensation while you have the potential to make so much more???Thanks a lot in advice and you seem like a really cool dude!!
1 I only use vlc on everything, on the iPhone, pc, IPad. You made my life a lot more easier 
1 Did a bunch of VLC people visit Disneyland Paris around 22 September? Were you among them?I remember seeing a bunch of people with the VLC hat on the train and on rides around Disneyland. :D
1 God bless you fam
1 u are a champ m8
1 I've been asking this in AMAs for a very long yet I always get ignored, but you seem like a nice person so I'm sure you'll answer me...Boobs or ass?
1 les gens pourrait etre intéressés par un AMA nan? ils ont l'air de t'aimer :b puis pas de raison que yai que nous sur r/france a avoir le privilège...
1 Well then who the hell created VLC and who destroyed it after two flower?Your name is literally top two in Authors-Programming. You are constantly active on VFINLC forums (destroying it and being rude).
1 I've used VLC for more than 10 years and just yesterday(!) I updated from 1.1.5...congrats on such a piece of reliable software! Any other cool projects you're working on, things that I can use for another 8-10 years without updating? :)
1 I have one question, VLC on my 4k panel dosent scale correctly. Like all the buttons are super tiny. Is there a fix, or an update coming?
1 I love vlc and all it does! Thank you man!!
1 Thanks mate
1 Hey....I love you !!
1 Are you planning a VR / Mixed reality mode?
1 Do you have a donation address for other crypto-currencies ? Bitcoin has very high fees that are impractical for little donations. I would propose ETH and BCH at least. Congrats for all the work !
1 You're the bomb.com thanks for everything.
1 Thank you! Want some Maltese beer?
1 when someone says they cannot open a video/audio-file. i always tell them to try VLC. one could stuff toast in it and it would give you video and sound
1 What's certain decisions lead VCL to it's prime?
1 Thank you so much for all the work you do and still keeping this free! Teams like yours are what the internet needs! Especially in times like this where net neutrality and data selling are so talked about. It's easy to only focus on money, not easy to focus on principles :)
1 Of course its gotta be a jew. You are probably collecting all my data just by using VLC, i'll proced to unistall it. Funny how jews are always behind shady shit. 
1 rip inbox
1 First of: Thank you! VLC is one of the best programs and one of few that still is free from adds and malware etc. Once again, thank you!In SMPlayer you can search for and download subtitles within the program it self. This is the one thing that got me to switch from VLC. It soooo good. So I guess my question is; will you ever add this function?
1 N'oublie pas de leur dire que tu m'as demandé de partager ma collection de porno mec.
1 Thanks for the amazing tool you made or helped maintain! It’s a huge deal and you should be proud of!Btw, the photo is awesome
1 I believe VLC has semi-automated crash reports (or had them, hasn't crashed in a while). What percentage of the ones submitted have porn titles in them?
1 Just wanted to say thank you for helping provide such a wonderful media player. I don't know what I'd do without it.Just built a new PC, and VLC was one of the first 5 pieces of software I put on it. I'm fairly certain I've converted all my friends at this point. 
1 So if it’s non-profit, does it mean you guys are not earning (much) from it? Because I think you should, since so many people enjoy VLC. 
1 What led to choosing a traffic cone as the logo?
1 VLC has been my first choice since my first computer, ten years ago. I can't imagine a computer without it. Thank you.
1 You’re the reason I can watch .mkv videos on my iPhone! WiFi transfers are great, thank you!!
1 Thanks, been using vlc player for years, great player :) 
1 You mentionned Swartz in another comment. Who are your internet heroes ?  
1 So Gryffindor?

194 On that note, is it possible to donate to him? 
146 Well, for starters the European Commission announced a few days ago that it will [fund a bug bounty program for VLC.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-eu-will-foot-the-bill-for-vlc-players-public-bug-bounty-program/)  This is conducted in the framework of the [EU-FOSSA](https://europa.eu/digitec/news/eu-fossa-project/) project voted in the European Parliament. MEPs Julia Reda, Max Andersson (both Greens/EFA), and Marietje Schaake (ALDE) have spearheaded this project and asked for more fund to enable these initiatives. So a good way to help apart from direct support is to *go vote* at European parliamentary elections (because yes, they matter) and research which candidates align with your interests.
8 Well until now we've been donating freely, frankly the model's been doing wonders until now. However it seem the new groove is to have the government pay for it. Well, I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that.
2 You are aware you can donate to VLC? If you like it, pay it! Edit: Added Contribution linkhttps://www.videolan.org/contribute.html
1 I agree turning that down is almost impossible, money would win the heart of 99% of the people who would have this offer come to them. He's a one of a kind person for declining that money, however something to repay him for what he's doing is definitely in order
1 I remember a time where open source was going to be the shit. Collectively we certainly have the brainpower to make better products than these giants do. Facebook sucked from the beginning, google and co is cluttered by bullshit, it's all full of ads, so much energy is wasted on marketing wanking and scheming, technology should go forward, not fuck us sideways. Yes, I'm doing very well without FB.
1 With tens of millions of dollars maybe?
1 Basic Income? Oops nevermind. I'm now a communist and barred from opportunities.
1 Maybe nooow you people will finally see the obvious fact that nobody respects people like him, they just want entertainment and they don't care about the money / privacy they have to give up for those things.Privacy? Ad-free? you exaggerate the importance those 2 things have to the average bloke
148 I have a very large cone too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
1 VideoLAN Client is the real name, I refuse to believe this Very Large Cone theory created by the road construction lobby!!
1 InitialismAcronyms are pronounced, like "NASA". Initialisms are spoken, like "UPS".  But you can't go wrong if you say "abbreviation" :)
1 Looks like an average sized cone to me
45 it's a feature i have grown so accustomed to that i get frustrated when it's missing from, like, everything else.
1 I shall celebrate by watching spinal tap with the volume at 200%
1 meh I'm still mad, it used to go to 400 until they nerfed it to 200!(pretty sure they both go to the same actual volume. But still. Pls gib 200 more)
1 If you go over 100 then you can get [audio clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_\(audio\)).  It is better than nothing, but turn up your system volume first.
1 I used this for years, until I realised it destroys the audio quality. Never used it since. 
1 just wondering  why do you use VLC on a daily?

1 I use SodaPlayer on desktop but on Android, VLC is the best I have found yet. Sadly on Oreo, some bug prevents me from associating it with some video formats so forced to use MX for them. 
1 A beer*
1 Jean-baptiste is the fool. Take the money
1 Shh, don't interrupt the circlejerk
1 Unironically this.VLC is for plebs.
1 And you'd have saved the NHS with it, wouldn't you?
1 Uh why?
23 What’s the problem with sacrificing money to give your users a better experience?
5 There's no problem, it's just that not doing it makes him a great person. 
1 Of course there is no problem, *but*, this is a very different thing where shady people have been trying to put adware/spyware in popular OSS software by buying them off. People like Jean have been effectively protecting us, open source users, from this bullshit for a while.Oh, and even if you don't use VLC directly, it is so widespread you probably used it or parts of it indirectly, very much like other projects like Linux and Curl.
1 Because the VLC icon is a traffic cone
1 You probably downloaded it from CNET or those shady sites. Always download software directly from the provider. 
1 While I agree, MPC has been abandoned and won't get updates anymore (I still use it though), but it's a matter of time until it gets discontinued. 
1 But a very moral one at that
1 Someone doesn't get "internet is free and for everyone", that's why we have freeware, open source and net Neutrality, if you want the opposite get out of internet and use cable and other media. 
12 You can get money in other ways than simply ads

1 Personally or for the non-profit?
1 The first versions where Goldeneye characters, because it was the first DVD we played with VLC. Then we decided to move to DW, because I loved the books and it provided with an infinity of names.

159 Hey man, just wanted to say thanks. Seriously. Incredible, free software is hard to come by. 
47 will you accept a winrar license ?
82 Let me just say you are my hero. Thank you. 
29 I'm down for a beer donation.  VLC is the only software I've used for a decade (is that right?) that didn't become aids for my computer 
30 Just wanted to say thank you for VLC; it's been my go to player for the past 10+ years on every PC I ever owned!
1 So, short story time:2 years ago, for VDD 2015, we decided to brew some VLC beer.As it was a VLC beer, it needed to be special: we plugged a tablet with VLC playing StarWars+StarTrek in loop, with speakers, in order to "excite" the yeast (so they could be impregnated with movies spirit), for the whole maturation. For that, we modified the bucket to be almost transparent at the top and attached the speakers to the bucket to transmit the vibrations.And also, the beer was orange/yellow because of the ingredient we put there.You can find a funny photo here of the result: http://people.videolan.org/~jb/VLC_Beer.jpgUnfortunately, those are the 2 beers left, and the color went away a bit :)
21 Best reddit answer ever.
17 We all would!If you ever in London I'd show you around town. 
16 I just wanted to say thank you so much. You have saved so many evenings where I've had to hunt certain subtitles on certain languages for my friends and fit them to movies! VLC has been such a good programme all this time!
7 Oh my god. Thank you SO MUCH for your work and principles. I would buy you a whole brewery if I could. You deserve all the best <3
13 Dude! You really the guy?

1 I'm pretty sure that if I'd put a slice of cheese into my CD drive, VLC player would still be able to play it. You are awesome man, thanks for being you. 
1 Pretty sure I saw you guys at Fosdem drinking *a lot* of beer :-) 
1 La frontpage de reddit, monsieur ne se refuse rien ! /r/france était trop petit ?Sérieusement, ça fait plaisir de voir ta bobine :)
1 I'm stateside and can't afford to send you beer overseas. Can I drink a delicious local beer in your honor? What is your preferred type? Hell, I hate IPAs and I'd even drink one for you.
1 Tu as un bar habituel ? Que je puisse t'en offrir.
1 Hey man just wanted to say as a guy who ran AV support for 5 years at a popular venue VLC saved my ass countless times when a client would bring in some random file that reufused to play on anything else.  I totally owe you that beer.

1 Long trip to send beer for me, but I sent some beer money along. Thank you!
1 You change the time we live in for the better with your creation, I use it everyday!
1 I would so send you booze or tasty snacks from texas. /r/snackexchange is my jam.Seriously. Best media player ever. The fact that you didn't try to monitize it out the ass when you seriously could have says a lot.Set up a PO box and I will send tribute my liege.
1 Thank you so much for all of your hard work, and for refusing to sell out. I have been using your software for something like 14 years, and nothing comes close to replacing it.I only wish I was skilled enough to contribute to the effort, as a method of payment. Maybe one day!
1 Just adding to it all — I use VLC player every day, thank you for keeping it hassle-free.
1 Si un jour tu viens sur Brest, la murge sera à mes frais :)
1 We can donate their cause!http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html
1 Oh man, I love VLC so much. I'll send you some beer too! It's saved the day dozens of times, as recently as last night. A friend bought a DVD she didn't realize was region locked. Her DVD player wouldn't play it so I just put it in my PC and it played with absolutely no issues. It's my #1 go-to media player, and I've never paid a cent for it. I think it's probably time for me to set up a recurring donation. The folks at VLC deserve every penny. 
1 I’ll send you some money next time I open VLC. Thanks for the good work and fantastic platform. 
1 Le champagne,  ça passe aussi? ^^

1 Upvote so everybody sees this and donate $5.- or more! [Donate here](http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html)
49 As much as I appreciate the program, I think these one-off funding programs are about as effective as the Potemkin incubators and tax benefits have been to promote Silicon Valley start-up culture: not much.American start-up spots developed around academic establishments with strong technical programs, low rent housing and offices, and access to steady financial support . We need to consider that these are people with quality of life needs that stretch years into the future and simply throwing them some scraps isn't going to do.Still, it's better than nothing. And I would vote for anyone that promotes it further, unfortunately I won't be able to vote for someone like Julia Reda for quite awhile unless the European lists are brought into being.
8 > Julia RedaHot damn, this might be the first actual accomplishment involving the German Pirate Party.
8 ALL HAIL THE EU!
19 The internet is dominated by companies running proprietary software and creating walled gardens. The internet, as the Pirate Bay founder pointed out, is broken. IT in  general for the general population is broken.And the people trying to create the next parasite to suck out your data and plug you into another software/product ecosystem are getting millions of euros in one go and media buzz. The people putting in work for open source are in comparison unthanked heroes working in an increasingly hostile technical environment.So, no, I don't think donating freely has done wonders. I think we need to do better, and it's not going to happen by regurgitating the "distributed, decentralised,  voluntary, free" buzzwords rather than implement a societal plan to actually make that work.

1 The extra 200 will come in a future DLC so you can get the full experience. 
1 I just treat it like an accessibility feature - sometimes the media base is just too low OR your situation requires that you deal with the loss and turn it up just to hear what's going on.  I think it's really well implemented and the clipping is unavoidable.  
1 I mean, it’s supposed to be used if audio was given way too much headroom to begin with. It won’t fix shitty audio, but it helps so much with bad mixes if you don’t have any other audio interface. 
1 I don't.  That's why I said "the other day" instead of "every day".
132 because we are proud of you
26 Thanks for this man
17 Merci à toi pour mes heures passées devant VLC.
13 I love you.

1 Maybe because of thishttps://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7hhbdq/european_parliament_has_approved_budget_for_vlc/
1 I think I might be a "maillon de la chaine", there was a post on /r/linux ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7hgukh/european_commission_launches_first_ever_bug/)) about VLC being part of a bug hunt funded by the EU comission (they are using VLC internally and start a bug bunty program -- they choose VLC as a first implementation of it). I remembered the fact that you turned down millions for our sake and casually mentionned it in the thread.Maintenant tu es l'homme le plus classe ~~du monde~~ d'Europe.
1 You're the best!!!!!!!! I remember back in the limewire days your software opened my entire (virus ridden) video library I had downloaded (win media player was trash). Dude you're the best thank you for such a quality piece of software.

1 Work for free then, go be a 'great' person. Even though if he accepted money he could do actual great things, like help the poor and needy, but ay, apparently being *great* just means giving Redditors free shit. Who would have knew.

1 Communist!
1 What side jobs do you do to sustain yourself if vlc is non-profit?
1 We don’t deserve you
1 Do you think it's immoral to profit of something someone creates then? Not trying to argue genuinely curious, I love VLC and I think it's great, but I wouldn't say you were "wrong" or a bad person or something if you tried to make some money off your own invention. 
-4 How come? You put some effort in it, nobody would judge you if you monetized it.
1 Yes, that is also an important point. But people would still go to videolan.org.
1 Not everyone but still far too many people, sadly :(
-1 How does selling a product you created make you a corporate boot lick? It's great that it's free but there would be nothing wrong with charging for it. 
2 People (like /u/kidajske) are so indoctrinated that it doesn't occur to them that you don't *need* to run your product like a massive money printer in order to make a moral sustainable impact on society. Reddit has given me so much insight into how the average businessperson views their "market" that it's almost nauseating. Open source projects such as VLC are the best representation of the human spirit, to spend your time creating something that benefits humanity and only requesting enough support to continue that project.

53 >  free software is hard to come byOnly on commercial operating systems. If you were to use e.g. Linux (which is free itself) you will discover that millions of people use (and contribute to) free software/open source software. And the open source variant often surpasses the commercial competitor in terms of quality.

10 I've used VLC media player for a long time and had no idea that you could get subtitles with the program! Here's an [article](https://www.techworm.net/2016/11/download-subtitles-automatically-vlc-media-player.html) on how to do this.
1 I totally now how you feel. I'm totally that guy for my spanish friends.Also, along with everyone else, thank you for VLC, man, damm good piece of software that one. Totally behind some sort of PayPal donation. Hell, I can't repay you for all the hours I've been using your software for free without ever putting a though about the creator, but if everyone just reading this would drop a tenner to give thanks for your work that might be a different story.Or hey, you wanna be paid in beer we can make that happen too. Just drop a public box address as suggested and make sure to pick the biggest box they have, cause you might have a few cases coming your way.

20 I agree with everything you've said, as a postdoc researcher in a technical field who is painfully aware of the precarious situation we endure, at least in my country. However as you say "still, better than nothing". I hope little by little the ball can start rolling. Agree as well in the European lists, we need them yesterday.
2 Hopefully it won't be a one-off: It's an official pilot project which may become instutionalized if shown to be worthwhile – Erasmus started out just like this.
24 Don't underestimate how much Julia Reda has done for technical sanity in the European Parliament. Also, please vote for her next election, she's pretty much the only lifeline we have to what is actually going on in the committees. 
1 Julia Reda has done amazing stuff in the past and she's currently fighting for a better copyright law! You should read up on her, easily one of the most upright and progressive politicians out there, mostly because she actually knows what she's working on.

56 "Croissant" actually means "growing".(that's not a joke: the word comes from the shape of the moon's waxing crescent, which happens during its "growing" phase, and it is the present participle of the verb "croître" ("to grow"). Also the English "crescent" comes from old French "creissant".)

6 You can't revoke old licenses unless it explicitly says you can. So the old source code would be licensed under the GPL v2 forevermore. That doesn't stop the millions of euro payment having clauses attached to it though, like being barred from working on any project that stems from the original codebase. So /u/Heknarf's idea probably wouldn't work.You could also lose the trademark, so you'd need a new branding. But that wouldn't have been too hard to deal with honestly.
1 He's already released the code under open source licenses though. You can't undo that. He just needs to use the code from his last release, and then work from that. 
4 See, that's what it's all about. If a company wants to give you millions for no good reason you take those damn millions.

8 They exist, just pretty rare. Claire-Louise for girls is one of the more common ones in the UK.
1 Ricky Bobby
1 They have in the Netherlands, but it's uncommon nowadays. Jan-Peter (our previous prime minister), Jan-Willem, Willem-Alexander (our king). 
1 Not just in the south if the US. I live in South Africa and (talking about English speakers here, not Afrikaans) I know a few people with double-barrelled first names. My mother, for example.
1 Its very rare for guys. You may hear names like Ricky Bobby, but that's usually a first name and a middle name used together. My first name is Michael-Paul and people constantly say my first name is Michael and my middle name is Paul when in reality I don't even have a middle name. In fact when I enter my name in online forms it rejects it saying there cant be any special characters in the first name. As a result my id, credit cards and bank card names would never match. Over the years I have had cards say, Michael-Paul, Michael Paul, Michael P, Mike P, M Paul, Mike Paul and MP. It took many years to get them all close to the same. Oh and my birthday is Feb 29 which plenty of places will not accept either. 
1 I thought double names weren't uncommon. Like "Theresa Mary May", "Donald John Trump", etc. Or aren't those double names?

1 > Instead of paying $5 to reddit, I'll make a note to donate it to the project when I get home. Especially since Reddit is not open source and censors contentreaching /r/all to spread a certain political message that the CEO's support.
1 Don't give $5 to reddit ever. This site makes money and is a FOR PROFIT organization. Would you give Walmart $5 periodically because you appreciate the user's product reviews?
1 Blame my parents.
7 Indeed. :)
1 You are welcome.
57 They don't make money as they are a non-profit. They can continue to support and update it because of donations. Wikipedia is a similar example.
1 The non-profit does not.I created a company that does a bit of consulting and spend most of its time improving the core of VLC. (Consulting time is maybe 25% of our time)
1 lol. There is no secret. I am just very lucky.
1 np
1  I cannot judge for others. But for VLC it did not feel right. And it would ruin the player for users.
1 If it’s immoral than capitalism as a concept is immoral. I don’t see how it could be considered ‘wrong’, especially in our current society. People need to make a living, and I’m absolutely sure he has some sort of income (through a second job, or a salary from the non-profit) or did in the past. Not everyone is in a position to essentially work for free, and shouldn’t be shunned for it by saying its wrong. 
3 It would make a worse experience for users. This is a very nice thing to do
1 it's not possible. support for the video player would fall through the floor the second they closed source it, and the second they tried to add advertising code it would just get stripped out by package managers.
1 Monetize, yes. Monetize against the users, no!
19 There's nothing wrong with it being free either. This is the kind of stuff a Star Trekesque, post-scarcity society could produce. Things like VLC shatter the "no one would make anything" argument against UBI. 
6 Do you have any idea, if we tried to chart code contributions, how many people made VLC possible in one way or another? Until you understand the virality of free software (GPL) licensing, you won't be able to grasp the number and what that implies for "intellectual property".I suggest starting by listing every on-board codec VLC has and listing the authors. And the authors they relied on.  Have fun.
1 > the best representation of the human spirit, to spend your time creating something that benefits humanityWhile his work is laudable, have some perspective ffs. He works maintaining a video player so people can watch pirated movies. He’s not working towards feeding the hungry or curing cancer. Best representation of human spirit 😂
1 Are you dumb? I literally said that it's great that it is free. That means I understand it makes a "moral sustainable impact on society", mr IamVerySmart
1 yeah well, its kinda like in that family guy episode when they see that hot news anchor in hd for the first time.some things are fine to be consumed as 720p blocky stream..i have seen things, man ʘ_ʘ

58 Define "often"
26 Linux users always make this argument but the amount of open source software available on Windows completely eclipses the open source software available on Linux. 
22 What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
9 Causes more problems than it solves IME. I use Ubuntu for my web servers and tried it for my PC for a year or so but it's just still not good enough imo, back on Windows now. Windows is a POS but it's still more stable than Ubuntu for me and simply less work, some of the open source offerings are great but I don't really have any issues on Windows in that regard tbh and cracks exist.
1 > Incredible, free softwareBZZZZZZZZT thanks for playing. He wrote "incredible" ... 99% of Linux apps need to die in a flaming dumpster fire.
1 > Incredible, free softwareYou missed a word there bud. Sure, free software is available - but it's not always _good_ software.
1 You are correct. I used Ubuntu for awhile but was deterred. I was too lazy and got uninterested. I should give it another try to be honest. 
1 You are a hero sir

1 yes, send nudes with a caption (I love you 3minman) or else a blatant lie!
1 Yes, have the team make the next verision of VLC player have an easter egg is someone types out "jbkempf" on a blank screen when a video isn't playing. Then **AND ONLY THEN** will I, a rando internet person beleive you.
1 No sir. Just wanted to say thanks for me being able to whack it as a teen. 
1 A small municipality of Austin called Del Valle. I work as the help desk guy at the high school and your software has saved guest speaker presentations, student presentations, it’s shown movies about bullying that brought kiddos to tears, it plays all our spirit stuff, our digital signage is tested in it. Our ASL (American sign language) teacher uses it for lots of accessibility purposes and to share videos she makes with the students and staff. VLC is likely the software I have the most confidence in that it will work properly. There’s a reason VLC is on a flash drive in my bag at all times

5 I think I will. I was just joking, since the German Pirate Party is pretty much a non-entity on a state/national level here. I know they're doing good work in the European Parliament.
7 >IT for the general population is Facebook and Youtube.Which is my point.>Have the European Union pay for products we use?Or create a state funded open-source foundation that works similar to the Max Plank Institute on a European wide level.  >When have "societal plans" ever worked?Oh for fuck sake. The typical "any form of clear organization is evil, only organization done for the sake of pure profit is good". There's way too much of that going around, especially in Eastern Europe.You live in a legal-financial environment which directs everything from corporate management styles, investment behaviours, intellectual property priorities and employee rights regarding private work. The economic system you live in isn't happening in some sort of purist void. The fact that you're letting go of control on that because of a distaste for "societal plans" only means it fall into the hands of corporate lobbyists.
3 > Have the European Union pay for products we use? Yes, a lot via tax evasion used by those company.

36 You'd be surprised how good free and open source software really is. Unless you have some very specific and narrow use-cases, I assume you'd be amazed at how good free software really can be, all without sacrificing usability and privacy.

1 Depends on your preferences. I'm in IT, have been using Linux for 20 years and am forced to use Mac OS until I've "arrived" in my new job. My response would be "always" for now.
11 A larger % of software is open source on Linux, but there definitely aren't more in terms in sheer quantity. 
15 Do you think so?I use both Windows and Linux equally, but am struggling to think of a single example of open source software available on Windows that isn't also available on Linux
6 Just comparing the number of open source packages for each platform is pointless. What matters is the amount of *good* open source software, and you'll find that most of those programs are cross-platform, barring ones that are restricted to one due to architectural problems.
7 Citation required
1 On the plus side, Linux users don't have to use a broken proprietary operating system. You can choose whether you want a bleeding edge crazy fast, crazy unstable operating system or a rock solid 10 ten years uptime but totally boring OS. Plenty of options in the middle, and if you get bored, just change it. Don't like the way it looks, just install a new and completely different desktop environment. To summarise, ner ner ne ner ner.
1 Does it really, though? There's also the consideration that open source windows programs are often Linux ports and integrate poorly, while on Linux you can stick to one ecosystem(Qt or GTK) for near seamless integration. Even if you mix them, it'll be nicer than in Windows.
1 True, if you put in the effort to find it. So the comment I replied to 'hard to come by' is true to a certain extend. For the sake of the argument some made up numbers: if there are on Linux 50k open source software projects available, and 1k commercial ones, then finding commercial software on Linux requires an effort. On the other hand if there are on Windows 2kk commercial ones a 100k open source ones then it's relatively harder to find the open source ones on Windows out of the combined available stack of software projects.
1 Maybe, maybe not. But on Linux I use the software manager for 99% of my needs. It works like a charm and keeps all my software up to date. 
21 please tell me this is a copypasta and you didn’t spend time typing that out
16 What you're referring to as *windows*, is in fact, Microsoft™ Windows™ 10™ Pro™, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Windows+10. Windows is not an operating system, but rather an opening in a wall, door, roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light, sound, and air, and is made from a non-crystalline amorphous solid that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage.

1 > Windows is a POS but it's still more stable than Ubuntu **for me** and simply less workYeah, it really depends on what you're doing with it. I installed Linux Mint for my mother and my grandpa and I no longer have to fix their "issues". There's just so much more unexpected behaviour on Windows. And Linux package managers are way more straightforward than updates and software (un)installation on Windows.
2 I've never had stability issues with Linux Mint.
1 Usually my experience too. About every year I'll tell myself that I'll give Linux an honest chance. Then I run in to some bug that ruins it. I've tried helping package maintainers fix them but it's like I can't get anyone bothered enough to work with me. Then it becomes way too much effort...
1 Maybe if you're used to calling applications "apps". People like you are guilty of Gnome. In reality, it's probably more like 75%. The difference between the two numbers is also the amount of really good Linux applications.

1 Noncompetes are bullshit and hardly enforceable. Imagine spending 10, 20 years of your career in a particular industry, then signing away your right to work in that industry after you leave a job.

1 so what would happen if he wrote the code and gave it to someone else or just told someone how to do it ?
2 Everyone needs millions. 
1 No you won't.
13 Yes it just means that they make no profit as the name implies
1 > A non-profit can still make money to cover expenses like paying its employeesI was gonna use this to ask about the difference between a nonprofit and a not-for-profit organisation, but decided to just google myself, cuz why not?>Nonprofit Versus Not-for-ProfitA not-for-profit organization (NFPO) is a widely based term that encompasses all organizations that are known more specifically as nonprofits, charities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs) and private voluntary organizations (PVOs). It is sometimes more accurate to use the term “not-for-profit” to place emphasis on the organization having the defining criterion of an intention to provide goods and services without seeking profits for private gain. A nonprofit – more broadly a not-for-profit – organization typically makes a profit, either from time-to-time or on a regular basis. This organization uses this profit, however, to further the operations of the organization itself and ultimately to facilitate the provision of benefit to the public at large. The difference between “nonprofit” and “not-for-profit” is largely a matter of semantics. While some groups can use both terms interchangeably, a distinction between the two is that a not-for-profit is an activity that is not intended to generate any profits, such as taking pictures for personal use, while "nonprofit" references an entire organization whose operations/products are not intended to generate a profit (an organization that offers free photography classes).
1 I mean, he explained it though. They are able to work on it and keep it updated due to donations. Obviously it takes money to run a business, even a non-profit, but they don't "make money" off of it per se. There is no profit, hence non-profit. Donations pay wages of the, I am guessing, small team that works on it. 
1 It is not right as it would decrease the quality of a product many people have worked on over the years to create software that millions can enjoy using. Not everything is about money.

1 When is it?  I will come if I'm in Paris.
20 There's so much ridiculously good, free software for media, gaming (emulators etc), graphic design/art, CAD/CAM stuff, animation, the list goes on. That's just on windows too.
1 Actually, if you have very specific and narrow use cases, Linux and OSS is often the way to go. Building an environment around your workflow can be a huge amount of work, but you'll never hit an actual brick wall like with closed source software.
1 OpenOffice?
1 I can easily think of the opposite though.  Darktable *just* got a to-be-maintained Windows port.  If it wasn't for those awesome folks, I'd have to use Windows and pay Adobe for Lightroom.

1 nah it's pretty obvious
1 I think that's the issue for most people when it comes to Linux. Most people don't "get bored" of their OS and don't really care how it looks. Like, at all. As long as it runs the few business and entertainment programs it needs that's really all that matters.

1 > The general population doesn't need anything but those two and the occassional job search website. When they do need it the service they desire is usually easily found on www.google.com with their trusty Internet Explorer.I guess you don't realise that universities are being flooded by private companies trying to get specialists to use their proprietary tools as the foundation of their education. Or that open-source is getting out-competed in government contracts for things from word processors to tax management because a company that repackages  their own supermarket software as "whatever you want" has more money to spend on presentation. You can't possibly know that, because then you wouldn't be completely ignorant of how much proprietary software has a stranglehold on every section of your life from your electrical bills, to the wifi you connect to in the coffee shop, to the employee management systems sold to HR departments. And all of them are leaking data, despite best attempts to stop it.>Yes, we must do everything possible and take it away from the corporate lobbyists, if we are to return to the glory of the 80's!Why don't we privatise the health services and the army, clearly that's also a stepping stone to communism. The American government shoves billions of DARPA and shits out SpaceX and Boston Dynamics. Meanwhile people like you abhor such things and turn our countries into Africa, because the idea that maybe the problem with communism was the autocratic management not the principle of state organisation in itself doesn't seem to strike.

3 Apparently not. 
1 non-profit only means that the company can't make money for its owners (shareholders).but they of course are allowed to make a profit as a company.one of the most lucrative non-profits i know is the highly corrupt fifa. they basically print money. all the profits are not payed out to owners, but redirected into an internal rainy day fund that is worth billions. and i'm guessing that fund got a lot bigger because of the world cups in russia and quatar.
1 Which most people don’t understand at all. A company like amazon could be non-profit if they just invested all their money back into the company in the form of infrastructure or higher salaries. Big businesses do this already anyways, to reduce their tax liability (though they claim some profits). 
1 > Yes it just means that they make no profit as the name impliesThe entity which own's Rolex is a charity/Not-for-profit and does not pay corporate tax !
1 Well, their goal isn't to make a profit.
1 I guess that depends on what they meant by "you" then. VideoLan the organization might not make money (read: profit), but the individual team members still can.

1 I was mostly thinking about stuff like games that don't work well on Wine/Lutris, design stuff like Photoshop, video editing etc. I don't think its controversial to say free/open source software is lacking here, although progress is being made.
1 OpenOffice is depreceated. Have a look at [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) instead. 
1 cooking copypasta surpasses Carnot Efficiency
0 oh thank god. I was really concerned tbh. 
1 The reason propriety software is outcompeting freeware, is because propriety software can afford to hire full-time professionals. [Bill Gates addressed this in 1976](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists) It's not just "presentation". All of them are leaking that, because nothing is secure and free or not, the data shall be leaked. Still, it has allowed companies to compete in creating the best service available, where "quality" has never really been much a requirement for a government project.>Why don't we privatise the health servicesWouldn't make our healthcare any worse tbh. >America shoves billions of DARPA Actually I support DARPA - as well as ESA / CERN - but that's R&D. 
1 I'm not using VLC. 
1 Does he accept dogecoin tho

1 will do. thanks for the link
1 Yup, did this myself a few months ago.
1 What's supposedly shady with Paypal?..
1 So I've been told 4 times.
1 I was talking about yours. Makes more sense than someone physically sending you beer.
1 €10,000,00.  Drunk european him doesn't notice. 
1 Not yet!
8 Office software is lacking too.
4 Yeah it's doubtful, but that's why those are £££ and the free ones are free. I just like how people have more opportunities to try out different things before they have to spend a boatload on software.
1 I see. Those are actually the reasons I still mainly stick to Windows, but I don't find gaming and photoshopping very specific and narrow use cases.But I've found automating frequent tasks much nicer to set up on Linux rather than Windows, and there's a ton of variety in everyday programs like music players and so forth. On Windows you have MusicBee and Foobar2000 as customisable players, on Linux there's a dozen projects which are similar in scope, not to mention mpd. As such I could organise and enjoy my music just the way I wanted on Linux, while on Windows I just stick to Spotify and kinda cope with it... Though at least I can run beets on Windows.
1 For games you are right, although you can run many Windows games on Linux. But it requires a bit of an effort.As for Video/Graphical software: there are amazing open source alternatives available that are often used by professionals (e.g. the Gimp, blender, ...).

1 >Actually I support DARPA - as well as ESA / CERN - but that's R&D.And what do you think an publicly founded open-source foundation providing and updating software libraries for public use would be? Nothing would prevent you taking those libraries, slapping a GUI over it, and then charging a customer a fee for providing tailored support and customisation for their use-case. It isn't socialism or some sort of tyrannical monopoly on software development. It's just common sense in a field that works on mathematical and algorithmic concepts stolen from publicly funded research and benefits from locking in customers by limiting compatibility, not just between software but between software/hardware versions (looking at you Siemens!).  The alternative to 80's communism isn't some cyberpunk-like notion of corporate oligarchy. And trust me they do not "compete in creating the best service available", the word is always "lock-in", and their software is completely inscrutable unlike public work so fuck quality. You have an unhealthy amount of trust in private companies, you should try your hand in software development, that'll shake the illusion quick.
1 >A 2013 meme currency is [reaching all time highs](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Dogecoin-DOGE).What on earth is happening with crypto this year?
1 I have a real life physical doge coin
1 no one accepts that trash
1 Always tell the address currency. A shit ton of crypto get lost because of wrong addresses
1 Thanks for the address, and a Segwit address too! I'm going to make a mental note to contribute soon.A quick Google shows me this is in fact their address:https://www.videolan.org/contribute.html
1 Oh sweet summer child...
1 LOL
1 One thing is that they hold people’s money for various lengths of time before depositing it into their bank accounts, making unknown sums of profit on all the money held in such a way at any given moment.Another is that they have been known to close people’s accounts without warning and without recourse, taking any money in the account.All issues with PayPal are compounded by their virtually non-existent customer support that is incredibly difficult and time consuming to navigate.
1 Short version, they aren't regulated like banks, but people use them like a bank, so there have been a *lot* of cases of people just not having access to their own money.     Another really shitty thing is that they just don't like the adult entertainment industry, to the point that if you're a porn star, cam girl, etc, they will just close your account and ban you. Had money in there? lol, not any more, it's theirs now. Weren't even using the account for adult stuff? Too bad, there's no recourse. They just don't consider adult entertainers to be people who should have access to financial services.     There's also a lot of incidents of people who have had increases in usage suddenly find their accounts locked for an undetermined amount of time. People using it as a payment option to start their small business suddenly find they have no access to their only source of income for months at a time, with no idea when they might see their own money. Obviously when a business starts up, they see an increase in cashflow, and if it gets frozen for any amount of time, the business is completely fucked. Lots of small businesses have been destroyed by this. 
1 I think he meant Bitcoin, which easily can be used for money laundering.Edit: uh-oh I said this in the middle of large cryptocurrency circle jerk group.. Edit 2: pls send help
1 That really depends on your needs. In my business everything happens in LibreOffice, and there might be features I'm not familiar with in MS Office, but not sure what that could be. Btw, the Gimp comes pretty close to Photoshop for many users.
1 > I see. Those are actually the reasons I still mainly stick to Windows, but I don't find gaming and photoshopping very specific and narrow use cases.Well, for most people I assume they mostly consume content and not create it so in that perspective, its kind of narrow. Even still there exists entirely good alternatives to photoshop and various video editors, but for advanced users this software might be lacking (thus a narrow use case). 
1 You should check out Solus, as I've said. The Steam integration is really, really good making Steam a hassle-free experience on Solus. In addition, it includes Lutris which comes with Wine pre-configured so that many Windows-only games also run; Overwatch for example has its own Lutris config but sadly I cannot run that as AMD GPU's and Wine apparently don't mix that well
1 I'm not an anarchist, a minarchist or a libertarian. I just see no reason for the government to start financing personal operation - least of which is VLC. Not to mention that this is going to end in nepotism and buddy-buddy deals - as always. Just because the government can, doesn't mean it should. Because of this right now VLC competitors - one of which I am using - are going to have to compete with a government funded operation. I would also like to point out that video players is one of the few instances where freeware won out, so having big government contracts flying around is a massive step back. >And what do you think an publicly founded open-source foundation providing and updating software libraries for public use would be? But that is not what is happening (and frankly, is it that bad that it should be happening?), what is going on is that the E.U. is paying VLC to improve its service. Bugs found in it wouldn't necessarily translate to other services. 
1 I may get downvoted to hell but we may be witnessing a speculative bubble. Will it pop? 
1 to the moon!
1 Steps towards mainstream acceptance - the downside is people who experience massive FOMO and/or want massive returns investing in shit-tier stuff/scams - like Bitconnect.
1 Anticipating that bubble burst
1 I do
1 I think you will find that meme traders keep some for when they travel to Kekistani establishments.
1 Good point, updated. 
1 That clears it up, very helpful, thank you.
1 But didn't dear leader Elon Musk create paypal?
1 PayPal freezes accounts and uses funds for their own interest returns 
1 Dollar is used for money laundering, terro funding, human trafficking, war financing, weapon sales, etc. Stop this bullshit ignorant stuff about bitcoin and cryptos! 
1 Because Bitcoin is a shady corporation.
1 Dollars and euros too... 
1 RIP
1 > Edit: uh-oh I said this in the middle of large cryptocurrency circle jerk group.. It's more that you were just talking out of your ass...
1 I think the only really irreplaceable MS Office program is Excel. Haven't found a free variant that I can use for financial spreadsheets yet.
1 You see the problem with using open source in an enterprise scenario is you're generally lacking in support, there's missing features that some users require etc etcI try to utilise as much open source software as possible in my role (Testing) but often there is no alternative to something like HP UFT, in the testing space. Or perhaps a better, and more common, example is Excel. There's so many features in Excel that are so integral for many large businesses that there really is no alternative.
1 And you think private companies don't involve nepotism and buddy-buddy deals? Listen, I'm not saying that it would a divine place lacking in corruption, but the Max Plank institute works, as does ICANN, W3C,  IANA, and many other organizations making the world you know work without asking for anything but running-money in return.  The whole software development industry is founded on government funded software, research and standard organisations and that stops just short of the public that is supposedly supposed to benefit from it.And VLC is not a personal operation. It's open source, meaning anyone can contribute to it,verify it and profit from using it. It's a public operation done for the public good. And they have to fight off patent trolls trying to sink them, pay for their own operational expenses and try to beg for money from their minuscule aware community while the owners of Windows Media Player are having champagne on the beach.>But that is not what is happening (and frankly, is it that bad that it should be happening?), what is going on is that the E.U. is paying VLC to improve its service. Bugs found in it wouldn't necessarily translate to other services. Consider for a moment, that of those "other services" it might include: People using VLC to look at endoscopy videos, schools using it to show examples in class or play recorded lectures, basically any use of video in society. And yes, it's definitely "that bad".  My field is automation where a few companies have completely taken over and developments are worrying. Security holes aren't being plugged, millions are wasted dealing with their software  compatibility issues, they push their way by bundling their products together and undercutting competition, and they poach some of the brightest people young so they can use them up before they have any idea what they want to do with their lives. We will likely never replace them, because they're so embedded into the industry that they can force any competitor out by obfuscating their hardware specs and communication protocols, causing compatibility issues with open source software,  getting government support over their security issues because they run nuclear power plants and water treatment with their stuff, and generally being a giant tick on the body economic.Like I said, IT is broken. 
1 Yea. Imagine a world were penny stocks did not exists and then almost over night they came into existence but nobody knew what they were. Some people caught on early and were able to buy massive amounts of them and prop up the market when demand surged. The new cool thing is these new pump and dumps (the other cryptos) are taking off and riding the "next" Bitcoin hype train until they fizzle.This is just my opinion of course. But cryptocurrency looks a lot like most pump and dump penny stocks with the million reasons why it is going to be the next big thing and the little info-graphics they make about them etc.
1 that's the helpful reddit spirit at work
1 I mean, it takes literally 5 seconds to use Google.But here you go: [PayPal fined $25 million for shady business practices.](https://news.avclub.com/paypal-fined-25-million-for-shady-business-practices-1798279810)
1 Not really, no. He created x.com, which merged with the company that became known as PayPal. He was ousted as CEO in 2000 due to fighting with other directors. Maybe he took issue with PayPal's horrendous business practices.
1 They also pretty quickly get shady law firms involved if there's something wrong with your account. 
1 Isn't that every bank (but to an lesser extend).
1 Bitcoin the corporation and 4chan the hacker right?
1 Ye I agree, especially if you are using it on an advanced level.
1 I've done pretty serious financial stuff in LO, never missed anything, though some functions are named differently. Do you have any specific functions on your mind that are missing?
1 "X is Y""I haven't heard that, how is X Y?""Ha, this idiot doesn't think X is Y! I'm so much smarter than him!"Redditors are in no way more concerned with one-upping each-other than with actually communicating, I promise.
1 It took you literally 5 seconds to post a smug non-answer too.I have more sympathy for the guy that asks a question instead of googling than I do for the guy that knows the answer but chooses to mock the guy asking the question instead of answering it.  If you feel like answering a simple question is beneath you, why did you feel it was crucial to respond at all?
1 They freeze accounts at random  for months at a time and invest those funds ... banks don’t freeze at random Also they always favour the buyer so easy to defraud the seller d with PayPal If want to
1 *Now i'm gonna downvote you for no reason whatsoever! * - a redditor probably
1 Someone piss in your cheerios there, mate? 
1 Look, it's simple, Reddit Karma is an objective metric of your value as a person, and if you don't know a thing that someone else knows, regardless of how obscure or inconsequential that thing may be, you are beneath them, and your Karma score will reflect that.If karma was about 'Participating in a Discussion' the person asking a question would be up-voted, and the person smugly not answering it would be down-voted. Since "HURR GO GOOGLE IT" is a karmic goldmine of a comment, then Karma must really be about who has the largest collection of 'facts' on hand!
1 Well, you have more comment karma than me so you must be right.
1 It's OK, sometimes I have to commiserate with the little people to keep myself grounded.
