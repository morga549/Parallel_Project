1 There we go, that's what I want to see from Jones. Maybe it backfires, maybe not but it's a deserved attack.I've been saying for weeks now, Jones attacks on Moore have been too professionally courteous. It normalizes Moore's behavior down to a political disagreement.Sexual Misconduct and 32 year olds dating teenagers is not a political disagreement it's creepy as fuck at best, and criminal at worst.Conventional wisdom is getting personal with the attacks will backfire but I'm not so sure with conservative voters. But even if it doesn't get votes, at the very least you beat Moore up so bad , that nationally he becomes an albatross for the GOP.
1 Just in case some of you or people you know are confusing the issue and think the only accusations include Moore dating willing teenagers while just barely over the legal consent age in Alabama I ask you read this:>Instead of taking her home, Nelson said Moore pulled his car behind the restaurant and began to attack her.>"Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me and putting his hands on my breasts," Nelson said.>She said she tried to open the car door to leave, but Moore locked it and continued to grab her.>"He began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch. I continued to struggle," Nelson said. "I thought that he was going to rape me.">She said she began to cry and beg him to stop and that eventually he did relent before telling her not to speak.>"At some point he gave up, and he then looked at me," Nelson said. "He said, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you.'"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/politics/gloria-allred-roy-moore-alabama/index.html
1 Apparently this position is considered "radically liberal" in Alabama?
1 A reminder:> “I tried fighting [Roy Moore] off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch,” Ms. Nelson said, growing emotional as she described the assault, which she said happened one night after her shift ended at a local restaurant, where she was a waitress.McConnell already said he believes this happened (when Beverly Nelson was 16). But now, thanks to President Pussygrabber's endorsement, McConnell and the RNC are okay with having a child molester in the Senate. Their fecklessness is disgraceful.
1 My wife and I started having kids about three years ago. We joke, all the time, about things we have to say to our toddler that we never thought we'd have to say to *anyone*. Things like, "don't eat french fries that you find behind the TV," or, "don't poke the dog with your fork."I feel like half the shit people say about the Republican party is exactly like that, these days. "Don't elect credibly accused child predators to the Senate," and, "don't pass historically unpopular tax bills that stand to hurt your own constituents." These are not things that we should have to tell them. 
1 > "I damn sure believe and have done my part to ensure that men who hurt little girls should go to jail, and not the United States Senate,"You sure have, Doug Jones. [You sure have.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ngPEIAXd5Q) 
1 Dear Ivanka,There is a special place for men who prey on children, but it's not hell, its the GOP Senate after being endorsed by your daddy.
1 Funny that the GOP still claims to be the party of family values while electing a child predator to the Senate.
1 Good. Attack him with the truth.But also make sure you explain why you're the best candidate.Stop letting these wackos be the whole point of the conversation."My opponent belongs in jail for physically and emotionally injuring little girls. I also want you to know that I am the best representative for Alabama's economy for the following reasons, which I will advocate for in the Senate _____. My opponent will vote against your own interests."
1 I prefer Senators who are allowed in EVERY mall. 
1 The GOP is disgusting. 
1 Good. Maintaining your dignity and refusing to mud-sling does not mean letting the other side walk all over you. You don't have to fight dirty-that's what they do. But fight, for fuck's sake. Do not go down without a fight.
1 Only in Alabama would a guy who prosecuted KKK members for killing girls at a church be the "greater of two evils"
1 Every time Jones refers to his opponent, he should refer to him as "Child Predator Roy Moore." All these nuanced moral arguments aren't nearly as effective as name calling in the Trump Era. 
1 I just donated $50 to Doug Jones campaign. I can't believe I feel the need to send money to an Alabama Senate campaign. WTF is wrong with this country?
1 If he does win, democrats should start referring to the Senate as hell.
1 Alabama: America's Afghanistan.
1 It's sad.  I think Moore's gonna win.  It's fuckin sad.  Like... why does this need to be said.  One candidate being a credibly accused child molester and attempted rapist doesn't make Jones a saint.  But...Have you no decency...  There is no message here that is decent. It's ok to do these things... just don't get caught for long enough?  Then you can become a Republican Senator?  I guess I can say I expected better from the GOP in the deep red... but we'll see what happens.  
1 *"Men who hurt little girls should go to jail, not the Senate."*Things you wouldn't have ever expected to say to adult Republicans in 2017, basically.
1 Sherman should have marched to Mobile. 
1 Should have an ad that says "This is a 32 yo man" *pictures of 32 yo men*...."This is a 14 yo girl" *pictures of 14 yo girls*
1 Feels good to see a Dem fight with some teeth! Way to go Doug Jones! Pull no punches!
1 Republican canned responses:"Whatever, they're all lying!"Or"Whatever, they weren't *that* young!"Or"Whatever, he's been forgiven by God!"Or"Whatever, they were all asking for it!"Or"Whatever, Hilary did it, too!"Or"Whatever, at least he's not a Democrat!"
1 But but but he didn't date *all* the preteens in Alabama. Take that liberals
1 Glad he went there!! Evangelical Christians really are such utter hypocrites. If Roy Moore becomes the new Junior Senator for Alabama then he'll be an albatross around the necks of all Republicans in Congress. I hope he helps sink their House majority and damages GOP chances to increase their Senate majority.
1 Alabama should be fucking ashamed of itself. 
1 This is this the first time he's said anything snappy to slam Moore since he first appeared on the scene. I hope he picks up the fucking pace and inspires some more support, he's not got much time left.
1 It seems like I see new signs for Jones everyday now, it's great.
1 **G**(ross)  **O**(ld)  **P**(edophiles) 
1 Welcome to 2017, Jones. My liquor of choice is bleach.
1 How the FUCK are we holding Hollywood to a higher standard than potential Senators? This chomo fondled CHILDREN, and LIED about knowing any of his accusers. This shit is fucking INSANE. 
1 Republicans are playing a dangerous game enabling the alt-right, neo-nazis, child rapists, and white supremacists. History will not think kindly of them.PS: FU%K'EM!!!
1 Roy Moore is a predator, Doug Jones used to put predators like Moore in jail. Yet, according to Trump, people should vote for Moore because he's "tough on crime". I'm starting to think that "tough on crime" might be code for something else among Trump and his supporters...
1 So, Jones is Oberin Martell and Moore is The Mountain.
1 Holy shit, I didn't expect him to get this aggressive. I think this will sway different voters into different directions, it's hard to say.
1 Jones is hitting the right notes here. He needs to fire up the Democratic base in Alabama, and rally disaffected GOP voters to his side. I really hope turnout in urban centers and suburban counties will be high. This will be key for Jones. High urban turnout could potentially cancel out Moores strength in rural area. Jones could be swamped there by Moore supporters. Anyone from Alabama here? How does it look on the ground?
1 Does anyone remember Republicans freaking out saying if Obama legalized gay marriage  pedophilia would be next on his list? Or did I just wake up from a coma and dream that? 
1 These people already elected a bigoted rapist to the White House. It's not a surprise that they're going to elect a pedophile to the Senate. Republican voters keep telling us who they are. We should believe them.
1 Keep it comin jonesy. Call him a coward and take his hat off his head. 
1 Republicans: Blah blah abortion right before birth blah blahMoore wins in a landslide.
1 Who would have thought this would even be up for debate in 2017?
1 I would like to propose we change "sweet home Alabama" to "what's your name" as the unofficial song for Alabama.
1 They elected a man who admitted to sexually assaulting women as a flirty strategy. They don't care.
1 Once upon a time, this was not a controversial statement. 
1 The amount of child rape apologists in this thread is fucking hilarious. 
1 I hope people always remember how corrupt and vile our current GOP establishment is.  Decades from now kids will read about this in history textbooks and ask their teacher how people could have allowed this to happen.
1 Men who rape 13 year olds shouldn’t be President. 
1 Roy moore wants to protect unborn children from abortion so that he can rape them 14 years later.
1 From his book"I knew Kayla was going to be a special person in my life," Moore wrote about when he first saw her when she was 15 years old. He wrote he began dating her when she was 23, a year before they married, according to the memoir."Anxious to meet her, I began with the line, 'Haven't we met somewhere before?' 'I don't think so,' she replied," he said, recalling the moment they met at a church Christmas party.
1 This is America, men who diddle go to senate, men who smoke oz of weed go to jail. 
1 good. democrats need to grow a spine if they want to compete in american politics. 
1 > About one-third of respondents, 34 percent, said they don't believe the allegations, while 24 percent were undecided.Interestingly enough that's EXACTLY the figure that supports Donald Trump Nationally.  Trump has a 1/3rd approval rating nationally and appears to have hit rock bottom with his approval ratings .. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/Which goes to show, 1/3rd of America has been literally brainwashed.  Been told anything they hear that comes out of the media that is badmouthing a republican is "Fake News".  There's absolutely no way to get through to these people, they have their demigod and they believe his word like they believe in Jesus.Anything he says is Gospel.  He could say one thing and then say the complete opposite the next day.  You could have television recordings of him saying the first thing and they would claim it's MSM bias and its fake news.I have no idea how you can get through to this 1/3rd, but it's frustrating to watch from another country while I have family in Southern states of the US ...
1 But Congress needs him to help Tow the party line. 
1 Being an elected official for the GOP appears to be merely a detour to prison now.
1 ...or the Presidency.
1 How could you not make a commercial against this guy with nothing but testimonials about his predatory actions?"Paid for by humans."
1 Men who hurt ~~little~~ girls should go to jail, not the Senate.FTFY
1 Sadly, Moore is still the front runner here. If Reddit wants to see how Alabama is reacting to this, head over to some conservative subs.
1 This one looks to be going to the senate thanks to Donald J Trump Billionaire he's owns a mansion and a yacht, his the GOP, their enablers, funders and voters.Party Above All Else!
1 Modern American politics is so disgusting.
1 Being an Alabamian is a fucking embarrassment at this point.
1 Said Jones, to the wall.
1 As someone who grew up in Alabama (and all my family still lives there) none of these accusations or reports matter at all to conservatives there. They literally do not believe anything at all from these stories are true (I guess except for those people who have been trying to justify it with Joseph & Mary stories??).  They’ve been told this is a left wing ploy and that Jones supports abortion for any reason up until the day of birth (my family has told me this plenty) so therefore murderer vs republican in their eyes. No concerns in voting for Moore with that logic for them. Abortion is literally all that matters. 
1 Think about this for a moment. When Breitbart learned that Milo was supporting pedophilia on hangouts and podcasts, they made him resign. As much as it sickens me to say this, Breitbart actually has more integrity than the GOP. Not much more, mind you.
1 The problem is that people in Alabama don't care. I can't believe this is even a debate in the US. To quote your president: "The American dream is dead." 
1 Sure doesn't sound soft on crime.
1 if i lived in alabama i would just move. those people are beyond help.
1 If Moore wins, and I lived in Alabama and had a teenage daughter, I'd be pretty frightened about her going to a mall or any other public place.  I'd leave Alabama too.
1 Completely unfounded speculation on my part: Eventually Moore will get caught with kiddie porn on his computer.  He's too much of a predator to resist the urges.
1 can we, the other 49 states petition to KICK ALABAMA OUT OF THE FUCKING UNION FOR THIS?pretty please? this is a disgrace. 
1 The fact that this needs to be said at all is such a sad commentary on where we are right now in politics. 
1 That's true, but it won't go nearly as far with that electorate as announcing "btw I'm pro-life, even though I'm a democrat."
1 This should have been Jones’ approach from the beginning, although I get why he was cautious. But you need to really make voters FEEL the pedophelia.
1 Hey the GOP has made their stance clear and its why even as an independent I say its beyond time for the Republican party to die. They are lost and are too fucked in the head to fix. This is a time where voting really matters and I know there are enough people in Alabama to make sure Moore doesn't win. Alabamans, get the fuck out and vote. This is NOT an election you can sit out. I really don't even know why you would. The day of not caring about politics are over. Voting matters. Period. Make sure the lunatics don't represent your whole state. They are a loud minority now show them that at the polls dammit!
1 This whole thing has really bothered me on a couple of levels, not the least of which is the hypocrisy of this whole fiasco. I don't know what else to do but shake my head and never spend a penny in Alabama or any business headquartered there. Even if Jones manages a miracle it's scary and disheartening to know a possible majority of people in AL are hopelessly stupid, indoctrinated, or enablers of this bullshit culture.
1 And little boys. 
1 Jones: I have never and will never molest or rape your daughters. Vote Jones!
1 How's everyone so surprised that Alabama sucks? The jokes didn't write themselves.
1 I just heard on the news this morning that something like 71% of Alabamans surveyed think that the charges against Roy Moore are made up.Another win for Fox News!
1 Roy Moore and supporters of child marriage are animals - nothing more. A cage is the best place for them.
1 The movie that Mystery Science Theater 3000 wouldn't do?  Was "Child Bride of the Ozarks."  And they made the right decision.
1 Individuals elected to office shouldn't sexually harass the staff and settle with a taxpayer fund.
1 That's the US voting population for you.
1 Fair warning to any senators or other politicians who are buddy buddy with Moore after he gets elected: I will only ever refer to you as First Name Last Name, the child molester lover.  I'm going to put all over Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook.  That is how your name shall be written henceforth. I'm going to take every opportunity I can to do it, and I'm going to encourage everyone else to do it too.  
1 I was not aware that Jones was involved in the prosecution of the killers of the four little girls in Birmingham. Man, what a horror if he loses to a monster. It’s just gross to even have Roy be his opponent.
1 As an Alabama resident, the biggest complaint i see about Jones on social media is “he’s a baby killer!” because he’s pro choice. He isn’t campaigning enough and Moore won’t debate him so i am starting to get worried about this election 
1 Last night the republican national committee reinstated it's endorsement of Roy Moore.  Today, after 32 years as a Republican, including working on multiple campaigns for state and federal elections, running caucuses for my precinct twice, and serving on multiple central county committees, I went to the court house and changed my registration to Democrat.  I still firmly believe that the party left me, not the other way around.
1 It completely blows my mind that this is even a question.
1 Alabama...let's see:  A 2011 find - 'The survey also found that 21 percent of likely GOP voters polled in Alabama believe that interracial marriage should be illegal'...more good stuff : Federal court orders in two cases took effect on February 9, 2015, and 47 of the state's 67 counties began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples that day or shortly thereafter, despite an order from Alabama Supreme Court Chief Judge Roy Moore not to do so. I wish I could say I'm surprised he's still even a candidate at this point, but this is a country the elected a guy who said, and I quote " Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.Bush: Whatever you want.Trump: Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything. " 
1 Don’t waste your gold on here!!! DONATE TO DOUG JONES!!!
1 I was a boy who was molested.  Fuck you.   
1 How’s the education system in Alabama? 
1 If this country wasn't populated by maniac evangelicals and controlled by a Republican party that puts their party over the country, we wouldn't even be having the conversation about whether Moore is qualified
1 This is literally the first picture and quote I've seen from Doug Jones since this race began. This deep state liberal media conspiracy isn't very efficient. Edit: I didn't really think I needed to explain that this was sarcasm. Sorry Reddit, I'll strive to do better.
1 Alabama : Men who are pro-choice hurt little girls.
1 It's true, but is it tru?
1 I’m okay with most of the Senate going to jail, too
1 Who is this Jones guy? It's the first I've heard of him. /s  Seriously, it is.  The media has been all covering Moore non-stop because there is no bad press, right? All press is good press. They should have been highlighting Jones since the start of this whole thing instead of covering Moore's misdeeds.
1 Thank you.
1 This should be what you might call a "no brainer", for fucks sake
1 Just more of Doug Jones being soft on crime. Alabama needs a senator twice removed from their Supreme Court to truly get tough on crime.
1 ...unless you're in Alabama. In which case, I'm pretty sure she's legally obligated to marry him, or have his father trade him an equivalent value of livestock. 
1 Doesn’t he know that being a Democrat hurts everyone, not just little girls?  /s  :( because it’s Alabama true. 
1 lol right to the jugular
1 Amen.
1 Alabama: “We’ll just see about that!
1 Fucking gottem.
1 That state is going to vote Moore in. Count on it.
1 No shit?
1 Amen and amen. Incredible that it even needs to be said.
1 Sucks this is a "hot take" in USA.
1 That kind of logic should apply to presidents too, but Americans didnt seem to care recently and elected an asshole.Can't feel sorry for them.
1 That audio needs more jpeg
1 I guess in Alabama it’s okay to be a pedophile...not bringing my kid to that state any time soon
1 Meanwhile, Georgia's wondering what the hell's going on next door.
1 You mean sentenced to flogging at the stake and then burned? 
1 Well yeah, but we're now living in the upside down where that logic isn't used.
1 aids mobile app redirect >.>
1 This is a political statement in today’s America :(
1 I am the Senate!
1 Roll Tide
1 If it were my way they'd go to hell.. Real quick. Don't waste our air. 
1 Who’s running against him? Is he a really weak candidate?
1 Sounds like a good campaign slogan to run with.
1 /nottheonion 
1 “Not little anymore though!” -next defense 
1 > President Trump on Monday offered his support for Moore, saying in a tweet that the Democrats' refusal to "give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts **for the super-wealthy** is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama."FTFY
1 Hell yes. Call it what it is. No apologies.
1 That would be true if Republicans were sane these days. 
1 2017 - the year where politicians are having to give their stance on if it is cool or not to HAVE SEX WITH LITTLE CHILDREN... JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, REPUBLICANS.
1 This is why the centrist Democrats will always have an uphill battle in getting my vote. Why the hell are you tip-toeing around this, you should have been yelling people who pursue middle-schoolers shouldn’t be in the senate a month ago... now it’s like please don’t elect him. It’s pathetic. 
1 But he’s 4 God. 
1 Honest question I'd love some feedback on:What can someone (like me) do in regards to *this* particular election when I don't live in the state and my congressperson and senators have all already publicly condemned Moore?I feel so helpless with so much in this country since my vote (even at the most local level) is already going towards a very progressive/liberal candidate in office.TLDR; I'm in Los Angeles, how can I help?
1 I mean he’s absolutely right. They should indeed go to jail.  Why haven’t charged been filed against Moore? Is it past the statue of limitations? 
1 Agreed, but what would be the best method of achieving that?
1 Agreed!! Anyone who sexually assaults and has proof and credible allegations should not be in Congress.  It’s so black and white to me.  Moores allegations are far worse than franklin but let’s set some standards of conduct!   It’s sad we all can’t agree on this!
1 Couldn't agree more.What is Jones position on Men and Women who use abortion to kill unborn baby girls for Gender Selection ?
1 So, your confessed sexual predator of a president called a proven pedophile candidate for the senate to endorse him. All of this because they need majority to pass a tax cut law which piggy-backs amendments for drilling artic reserves and determine conception as a legal human being.>According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Moore has a slim lead over Jones in the race.Holy fucking shit your country 
1 Democrats need to take off the gloves and drop the GOP in their own filth
1 It's crazy how Republicans are willing to throw morals out of the window just to serve some damn political agenda.
1 Inbreeding.....Seriously tho it is an example of the old boys will be boys shit and the south is always late for dinner.
1 But if they make it to the senate, they should stay and not be questioned and be treated like a hero, unless they're Democrats.
1 I love (read: I'm disappointed but unsurprised) that this discussion turned to discussing religion
1 Jones: If we don't get back the majority in Congress we are all going to hang.
1 Hey Jones, try having a more unique last name
1  *“Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over."*
1 Only a disgusting pervert would vote for a disgusting pervert.  
1 For a second I thought it was Alex Jones 
1 If you support Roy Moore, would you leave your child (hypothetical or otherwise) with him? The same question goes to Trump supporters.
1 Where is the criminal or civil case against him? 
1 His voters don’t know these things. Redditors know. So what can you do? Find 5 random people from Alabama on Facebook and talk to them about it! 
1 I agree. If they can prove in front of a court of law that he hurt little girls, he shouldn't be allowed in senate. As of right now, that hasn't happened. As of right now we still just have allegations
1 People who hurt little people should go to the morgue, not jail.
1 There's going to be so much salt here when he gets elected.
1 To characterize the 'accusations' against Roy Moore as well founded is a blatant misrepresentation.What the Washington Post did was to report on the FACT that Moore dated much younger women after he came back to Alabama after spending more than a decade at West Point, the Military, Vietnam, and then one year as a ranch hand in Australia, and finally law school. By the time he got back to Alabama, the vast majority of women his age were long ago married off.At that time, it was NOT uncommon for men to date and marry much younger women, this was an established practice in America, particularly the South which hewed to tradition. Marrying older, especially when the average age of marriage for women was 19, was not a bad idea. The facts are that Moore always asked permission from the parents of the young women he dated, and the parents were fine with their ‘of age’ daughters dating a gentleman who had already distinguished himself with great accomplishments. Moore was now a practicing lawyer, and one woman interviewed by WAPO said her mother told her that Moore was a good catch. Young women at that time were more mature than young men their age. Women were not looking for careers, but rather, a good husband. And, Moore, a West Point graduate would have been considered head and shoulders above the young men the same age as their daughter. And, Moore being in his early 30’s, was hardly an ‘old man’. Physically, there isn’t much difference between 18 and 30.WAPO took a TRUE FACT, that Moore dated much younger women [he DID marry one of them, his wife of many years]. These women have attested to the fact that they dated Moore, and each and every one related that the most ‘sexual’ thing that happened was consensual kissing. Though WAPO does NOT point this out, these women’s combined testimony is that Moore had always acted as a perfect gentleman, taking them home when they asked, breaking off relationships with no problems, asking permission from their parents. But, WAPO doesn’t present Moore’s dating history with these women in this manner. Instead, they try to blacken Moore’s reputation with stories that Moore was some sort of stalker, frequenting malls and football games, searching for women. Even if this is true, how else is a young man looking for a mate supposed to proceed?To this FACT about Moore dating young women, WAPO searched and found TWO lone women willing to relate stories of sexual molestation and assault. Both of these women have histories as being liars. One, Corfman, had previously accused a number of pastors of churches she attended of sexual improprieties, and I heard it stated that she has said that her accusations would be dropped….for money. The other woman, Nelson, claims she met Moore at a restaurant she worked at, where Moore was a frequent customer, who leered at the waitresses, making them uncomfortable. Yet, another women who worked at that restaurant for three years during that time frame, states that she does not recall Moore ever being at the restaurant, and certainly not as a regular. Nor does she remember Nelson ever having worked there.Both these women are know to have reputations as liars, and their stories have many ludicrous holes in their accusations. Mo Brooks, the well loved congressman from Northern Alabama, and one of the three prominent candidates in the primary for the senate which Moore won, is a former prosecutor. He said he has reviewed these women’s stories, and as a prosecutor, simply does not believe their stories. Brooks is an outspoken critic of president Trump, and presumibly , not a huge fan of Moore. Possibly, he is simply a man of character and is standing up for a man whose reputation is being grossly, vilely SMEARED by the Leftist Cult Movement political machine. ‘Thou Shalt NOT Bear False Witness’ is still a key commandment, and breaking it is a Mortal Sin.Thus, what we have heah, is a failya ta commoonicate…...What WAPO is doing is taking TRUE story...that Moore dated, and married, much younger women. Then they are EMBELLISHING this narrative with fabrications from two, known liars. They refuse to allow Beverly Nelson’s yearbook to be examined by handwriting experts to verify the innocuous signature which Nelson claims is Moore’s signature, yet contains some very curious aspects, in that the signature matches the signature Judge Moore signed in her divorce decree from 2006. Why would Nelson and her lawyer, Gloria Alred REFUSE to allow the yearbook to be examined.Thus, your article on CBS is BLATANTLY presenting this story by asserting that the accusations are quite solid and believable, when, in fact, there are HUGE questions surrounding these two LONE women, both with reputations of being serious liars, whose accusations are from 40 years ago, where there are no witnesses, and where their stories have holes in them wide enough to drive the proverbial truck through. In other words, this story with it’s blatant disregard of the likely falsehood of these two women’s stories, is just one more Left Wing Media Hit piece.Frankly, this story of this incredible SMEAR campaign by the Leftist Cult Movement against an honorable man, a man with a reputation of honor over his entire life, truly needs a many page expose written about it. This episode DESERVES an expose story written, as such VILE tactics used by the Leftist Cult Movement are beyond disgraceful.The Leftist Movement and it’s VILE, EVIL tactics needs to be exposed in full to the American People.
1 What about those trying to subvert the democratic process with BS accusations?
1 GET FUCKED ROY (no, not by a little kid, mr. Moore, “get fucked” is more of an expression, not something to put on your redneck “to do” list.(Also, your crimson pedophiles didn’t deserve that playoff spot).
1 The headline's just a giant "duh". Of course they do. Now, to play the devil's advocate for a second (and likely get downvoted to oblivion), aren't these still only **accusations**? Whatever happened to "innocent until **proven** guilty"? I say open up formal investigations into all accusations and *then* remove him from office (if he wins election, of course). It's just... there's so many people who automatically equate accusation with guilt and refuse to go any further, particularly if the accusations are against someone they dislike. To this end, it's no different than the wackos accusing Obama of not being a natural-born citizen due to the birth certificate nonsense. Passing a blanket judgement on GOP members and the people of Alabama is the same blind & ignorant intolerance we claim to be against. Stop it.
1 Everyone has to drop this immediately. Whether or not Roy Moore did what the allegations are against him if this campaign 2 remove him from the contention of a seat and government works there will be a precedent for this. Every last person running for office that looks like they're going to win will miraculously have someone come out against them with sexual allegations from God knows how far back regardless of party affiliation. You know this will be true I know this is only true everyone knows this will be true if this works then this will happen again and again and again and again and again to the point of where nobody knows what will be true or false on the sexual allegations.
1 FIRST OFF, I think he's a creep after watching many videos and reading on him extensively don't get me wrong but we should be fighting for an investigation and yelling look into this immediately not fighting for instant jail time and you're guilty immediately. We saw Republicans doing this to Democrats extensively now we are doing the same. Seeing this in Hollywood and all over and it's sickening because most all of it points to truth and wrong doing for these people in powerful positions and they need to be gutted asap.No matter how opposite someone's views are from our own, due process and innocent until proven guilty should remain a very important part of our society over quick burn the witch hunts after someone points a finger. I'm not saying he's innocent or guilty I don't know more than I've read or heard but guilty till proven otherwise is a terrifying road to go down and it's been a major problem on both sides for quite awhile. If he did what he's accused of I hope he gets what's coming too him, if he didn't and is innocent i still hope he doesn't win, but I hate how convinced people are of wrong doing right off the bat. We've seen plenty of false accusations come to light way after the damage is done and even more proven true and horrifying. I just wish the rhetoric would switch back to yelling for an immediate investigation and not to just a screaming of guilty guilty with no real proof. 
1 Ok, whatever Star Wars fan.
1 HOW IS THIS NEWS.God I hate 2017.
1 I support Trump! 
1 Innocent until proven guilty, amirite?
1 If there was any evidence he hurt little girls that's exactly where he would be.
1 Is he talking about Clinton?Or is this just more daily fake news garbage? Oh right.. they don't even try anymore to be credible, justs spread fake garbage for the few idiots left who actually believe the mainstream swamp media.
1 Women who falsely accuse should go to jail, too. 
1 Agreed. Here's the thing though, you need evidence of this. Otherwise any accusation euqls immediate disqualification. Which is heinous. 
1 Regardless of the illegal nature of the claimed actions or their moral wrongness,  a 14 year old is a *teenager*, a "little girl" would be a 6 year old. Sloppy titling.
1 Jones is sure confident about his background.tick tock.
1 Any proof?  Proof that Moore is a pedophile?
1 “Guilty until proven innocent”-this sub, *still*
1  the left won't have a leg to stand on in this argument as long as Al Franken is still holding office
1 Hilarious. It's like liberals live in a different reality. Roy Moore didn't hurt any girls. Doug Jones supports the murder of baby girls and boys en masse.
1 Where's the yearbook?
1 Proof?...guilty conviction? Jury? Judge? Innocent till proven guilty? Muh senate seat doe? Do facts matter?
1 Alex Jones?
1 You mean like children in the process of being born who are hacked apart? 
1 I agree with this! I absolutely hate Moore and am deeply upset with my president for reaffirming his support for this man.However, liberals really don't have a leg to stand on in this argument. Democrats have just started to take sexual assault allegations seriously, and are still giving politically relevant figures a free ride. Where are the calls for Franken to step down? There's photographic evidence of Franken groping a sleeping woman, but liberals have no issue with him. Dems protected Bill Clinton straight through his wife's election and only started to go against him once the Clintons ceased to be politically relevant.Sexual assault and molestation are disgusting. But so is pretending to care about sexual assault because it's convenient for your agenda.
1 If only Democrats could apply this same type of "logic" to, say, prophets of major religions and those who are taught to emulate and revere that prophet.  Just sayin'
1 [deleted]
1 And Democrats should stay far away from the Senate, just like Jones will.  We need more anti-establishment candidates in the Senate rather than the bought and paid for Dems. 
1 Why is it just men and little Girls? People hurting children in anyway should go to jail. The above statement is extremely sexist.
1 what about Women who hurt little boys should go to jail?
1 Like bill Clinton?
1 Joe Biden, the clinton crime family. Ted Kennedy let a women drown if that's a big deal or not. Jared Fogle is beloved progressuve. Schumer sex scandal
1 Absolutely.Those who murder baby girls in the womb for no reason other than "oh i just didn't feel like it, it was an accident" should go to prison. Not only do people who do so get elected to the Senate, but there's even a lot of politicians out there who outright campaign for the right to kill babies for any reason you want. 
1 Al Franken must resign. 
1 I have a controversial opinion of this:What he did - or was accused of doing - was 30 years ago (or more).  It has come to light, and the voting public is aware of the allegations against him.  What needs to be determined is whether you value his Republican perspective over that of his Democratic opponent by such a margin that you can overlook something highly highly questionable 30 years ago.In the end, I actually agree with Trump and McConnell's opinion that this is a matter for the voters of Alabama.  Further, if they vote him in, I think it would be abhorrent to NOT seat him in the Senate - as this is quite actually the will of the people.  As insane as that is.
1 what's the difference ?
1 Well Gen. Eisenhower murdered woman,kids, Old people,prisoner and he became president 
1 Good thing Roy Moore doesn't hurt little girls. He hasn't even been accused of hurting anyone. He was basically accused of "courting" three girls who were btw within the legal age of consent in Alabama at the time. But hey... inb4 Doug Jones actually did abuse someone.
1 There are thousands of hurt little girls in Libya, but the DNC didn't give a fuck when they helped the EU get cheap oil.
1 But fuck children in the womb, am I right? Kill the shit out of them!
1 So why isn't Bill Clinton in jail?
1 THEN WHY IS HE BEATING YOU!?!I woild vote for DJ too. But this is weird. He must be very uncharismatic. 
1 Girls who lie in court several times should go to jail.
1 I agree, let's his democratic colleagues out 
1 lol fake newsSee you libs in 2024
1 Can liberals/democrats do a single thing without virtue signaling?
1 Maybe he should work on removing the currently sitting senators that have committed sexual misconduct and kiddy diddling then instead of running his mouth about an opponent.
1 Agreed.  It's crazy how Al Franken with 5 girls hurt by him is still allowed in the Senate.I'm just glad Conyers stepped down after hurting all those girls.
1 Do you guys seriously not see that this is just propaganda. Whether he did it or not is besides the point.  Why did she just so happen to come forward when he wants to run for senate? Seems a little fishy to me. 
1 Where was he when Hillary was running for Senate, after getting a child rapist acquitted by attacking his 12 year old accuser, and then laughing about it in an interview?
1 yay lets push these fake accusations even harder!
1 Says the man who supports murdering little girls in the womb.
1 >I've been saying for weeks now, Jones attacks on Moore have been too professionally courteous. It normalizes Moore's behavior down to a political disagreement.That's the same mistake everyone made with Trump during the campaign, and look where it got us.
1 I understand the principle but honestly find it hard to believe, especially in this case.Is there someone out there who was going to vote for Doug Jones, but decided to stay home after he calls out his opponent for child molestation?Is there an Alabama voter who was on the fence about whether to vote for Moore, what with the pedophilia and all, but then hears Doug Jones make a comment like this and decides "that's just not right, I'm gonna go vote for Moore!"Voters on the left don't respond as positively to negative campaigning as voters on the right... but that doesn't mean politicians on the right should get to go unchallenged when things are this egregious.
1 Jones refused to go negative against Moore because it's what lost the election for Strange. Strange kept breaking out the negative ads about Moore having to be removed twice. This allowed Moore to bring out his wife for an ad with the "he got fired for what he believes in" sob story. Couple that with the fact that most Republicans view Strange as corrupt for how he got the senate seat and it was an easy win for Moore. If Jones had done the same thing, he would be losing in a landslide.
1 Bingo. Jones needs to go on the attack. For weeks it's been Roy Moore this and Roy Moore that. Sure it's mostly negative stuff but Democrats in particular want someone who they can vote FOR. Simply voting against Moore is not enough. Honest Jones needs to be more visible and show that he's a fighter - who can take on not just Moore, but also the corrupt McConnell. We know he can, his record says he can, now he just needs to show it.HIT THEM HARD DOUG!
1 It seems like a solid strategy to me. Voters on the left won't suddenly prefer a child molester just because his opponent is more aggressively attacking said molester.
1 i had a co worker in his mid 30s who was dating this 17 year old girl, and had apparently been with her for a few years. He'd brag about it and then wonder why we'd all avoid him and never hang out with him. that shit is creepy, i was 19 then and was grossed out, now that i'm in my mid 30s and have a daughter i'm horrified by the thought of these kinds of guys running around. 
1 He's obviously right, but you will still get much further if you spend your time telling people why they should vote for you instead of why they shouldn't vote for the other guy.  Doing the later has the effect of them not voting at all and you still lose. 
1 Jones should be fire and brimstone on TV every chance he gets about this, demanding that Moore debate him and calling him a pedophile.
1 Hell no it won't backfire. No offense, but it's this bullshit tiptoeing and political correctness, yes I said it, that keeps burying dems in every election. Doug Jones should be getting on TV in front of rallies every night nailing this son of a bitch to the ground. All we fucking hear these days is Moore's denials. Every time Moore denies he touches little girls, Doug Jones needs to come out fucking swinging HARD against this sick pedophile. People in Alabama need to WAKE THE FUCK UP. And sometimes, the only way to do that is to drop the decorum and call out this insanity for what it is. 
1 The problem with my shithole of a family is not that they think that they were willing teenagers, ***they don't believe any of this happened at all***. It's so hard to go home and have to deal with every electronic device blaring Fox News.
1 That's just locker room talk, all guys do that.
1 Shouldn't they be playing ads with these women telling their stories?  That's some awful stuff.
1 That last part about no one believing her makes me sick. That’s what a movie villain would say and I hate that he’s right for the most part.  Obviously there are people who believe these victims, but there’s so many republicans who don’t, or who don’t care, and obviously he’s not in jail, so there’s that. 
1 My heart stopped and I am speechless
1 Holy shit. And to think he might still win.
1 Alabama has an opportunity to set a tone in this country.                                                                                                                                                                      I was 13 years old when a man twice my age sexually assaulted me.  I was terrified and confused but lucky my mother and other people believed me.  My assailant did not hold a position of power and in my case the perpetrator was not found, therefore he was not stopped and held accountable.  I have wondered if the man continued to assault underage  girls or did his assaults worsen to rape, kidnap or murder.  Many people have come forward concerning the male republican running for the US Senate in Alabama.  He has held positions of power in the past, apparently he did he use his power to keep his victims silent.  Will the people of Alabama have the courage it will take to not reward this man with a seat in the US Senate?
1 wearable everyday cameras are going to become a thing, mark my words, people are going to document their lives in order to protect themselves.
1 I don't believe any of that. 
1 Is that the fake signature yearbook one with the same lawyer who had the fake armrest airplane trump girl?
1 http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/child_marriage_is_still_legal.html>Just over 8,600 of those child marriages took place in Alabama. The youngest was 13 and the biggest age divide between spouses was 60 years. A 14 year old girl married a 74 year old man, according to the Frontline data.>Alabama ranks as the 4th highest in the country for total child marriages since 2000. Over that time, Texas has allowed more than 40,000 child marriages, highest in the country.So does Alabama culture pride themselves on child marriages?  
1 I would imagine anything not pro-right is considered *extreme*.
1 The Secretary of State in AL said that a Jones campaign ad that amounted to "people will know if you voted, you can't sit this one out" is voter intimidation. I'll be surprised if we don't see polling precincts in Birmingham and other major population centers get moved or shut down all over the day before voting.   
1 And "weak on crime" by Trump and his fellow congressional republicans.Maybe it's not a dog whistle after all and when Trump says he wants someone who is "strong on crime" he's just taking it the opposite direction. He wants a strong criminal.
1 See this shouldn't be anything political. Even if you're a republican you should be looking at this guy, saying "Oh hell no" and voting against him. But that goes for most of our government right now.This why it's so important that if you live in AL and can vote, you do everything you can to get out and vote. Hell, this goes for the entire country. There's no reason we should be seeing 40-50% voter turnout in 2017-2018, or ever again. I don't care if gerrymandering is fucking over your state, get out, vote, and show those numbers.
1 Anything that isn't pure Christsharia law is a communist coup on Jesus and his Constitution of the US.
1 I hear reality has a very liberal bias.
1 Don't forget weak on crime!
1 Not when you think every news report contrary to your personal beliefs is “fake”.
1 It's considered radically liberal among _republicans_. Don't blame this on Alabama and let the republican party off the hook. Roy Moore represents the GOP. He was endorsed by trump. He is not just an Alabama phenomenon, and he'd get very substantial GOP support no matter what state he was in. 
1 The real issue is according to a recent survey something like 71% of Republicans don't believe a word of the allegations. After seeing those numbers Moore has walked back on his previous statements about him being a gentleman since he was getting approval to see these girls to doubling down on not knowing any of them and everything being false/made up. Seems to be working since he has since received a full endorsement from Trump, the turtle has walked back his statement on Moore needing to step down, and the RNC is back to openly funding him. They thought he was going to lose after all the allegations came out but now that they see such a large majority don't believe them to begin with, they're all good with supporting him openly again.
1 That depends on whether a democrat is saying it, or a republican. Whatever the republican says isn't radically liberal. 
1 Only for Republicans.
1 "first they came for the child molesters.."
1 Or family values apparently :/
1 I can’t get over the notes he wrote to the girls as they graduated from high school. One even called him a mentor. He was such a sick egomaniac that he needed children to serve in the role of supplicant for him. 
1 Roll Tide!
1 Can we just kick Alabama out?
1 It's really not - it's pretty clear they're sabotaging eachother with rape allegations. It's not like this is anything new.
1 Have a d next to your name is radically liberal, however having your d in a 14 year old girl is just good old fashioned values.
1 Apparently this position is considered "radically liberal" in ~~Alabama~~ America according to the President and RNC.FTFY
1 Anything that disagrees with the mainstream authority is radical.
1 The fact that he isn't for straight up banning abortion means he's a "murderer" and people will vote for the child molester over the "murderer".. Ugh
1 I wouldn't mind if Alabama seceded from the US. On the grounds that we keep "Sweet Home Alabama."
1 > Apparently this position is considered "radically liberal" in **America**?
1 Conservatives have no principles.
1 Massachusetts elected a man for decades who murdered a woman and covered it up. 
1 Right along with learnin' yer letters and wearing shoes in public. 
1 Any position that's not missionary is considered "radically liberal" in Alabama.
1 Traitors never change. They never believed in the laws of America in the first place beyond "Fuck you I get to own people"
1 Same reasoning as 'it's okay to be white' is seen as radically republican.
1 Punishing people for allegations and nothing more absolutely is. And that's not just Alabama that thinks that. 
1 Apparently innocent until proven guilty when evidence has already been faked is "radically conservative". Lul. r/politics 
1 The whole situation is politically framed. Before this, it was Strange vs Moore with lots of people weighing in. Then it was Jones vs Moore with lots of people weighing in, with lots of articles about how Moore wasn't fit for the Senate. Then the sexual assault allegations came about with lots of people weighing in. There was never a break in the whole "We can't let Moore get elected" conversation. It just segued right into "Now Moore shouldn't be elected because of the allegations". It's natural for people to be skeptical or double down on their original decisions. 
1 It’s probably more of “innocent until proven guilty”.
1 I was just thinking what a Twilight Zone this puts McConnell in. Okay, so you believe the women that Moore is a serial child molestor, but the head of your party has endorsed him and the fundraising organ of your party is back in the tank for him. 
1 None of them ever gave a shit about the allegations. They only gave a shit about losing the seat. Three weeks ago condemning Moore was the best way to keep the seat so that's what they did. Now that the race is closer the best way to keep the seat is to support him so that's what they're doing. It's gross. They're gross.*clarified my point and added that they're gross
1 Grand Old Pedophiles
1 I think it's opposite. Mitchturtle and the donors decided he needed the senate vote, so he told Trump to pretend to be in charge.
1 And even if, like the comment above, you are ok with the age being 16 because that's just how it is in Alabama, his behavior is still reprehensible regardless of age. The age just makes it worse. 
1 Plus, there was another woman who flat out said he pretended to be her father to take her out of trigonometry class.  Like, wow.
1 If the democrats had 1% the win at all cost attitude the GoP does they may actually win something. Don't talk to me about Virginia, it's a northeast blue state.
1 Man, a full out revolution would do us some good right about now.  
1 Which is why i thought the posts story came way too early, imagine if it came around this time. The senate won’t need him because their tax plan passed (ugh) and trump has a lot more on his plate to deal with mueller and Flynn etc to address it initially
1 Don't drag my name is to their mess.
1 Didn't McConnell say wait for after the election then we'll deal with this appropriately? 
1 Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the organization of Republican Senators that is in charge of helping get new Republicans elected is still withholding their funding to Moore's campaign.  So even though I want almost nothing more than for Senate Majority leader Yertle the Turtle to go back to his private life forever, I don't think he supports Moore whatsoever. 
1 And people are trying to defend him too. That's the sickest part... Those same people who probably used to post on Facebook articles about "suspected pedophiles" with phrases like "a bullet is cheaper", "just hang him", and "no need for a trial just take him out back and put a bullet in his head to save taxpayers" are now the people yelling "Innocent until proven guilty!!" 
1 Can you imagine the brainwashing that must be occurring to get to this place? This is way beyond religious indoctrination to hate a group so badly you'll take a child predator over one. 
1 i have two boys. "stop body slamming your brother". "the dog is not a horse!!"  I dread the teenage years where they will be as big as me and probably stronger. Dad strength has its limits. 
1 In the case of Republicans I'm discovering it's easier to give them lessons in a way they can understand: "Stick your tongue in the electrical socket." "Touch the hot stove. Now, touch it again." Honestly, it's the only way they can learn.
1 >things we have to say to our toddler that we never thought we'd have to say to anyone"Get Lucifer out of your mouth!" - My wifeOur eldest daughter was chewing on a [Lucifer the Cat toy](https://www.fantasiescometrue.com/images/medium/fct_c67f9db61373767.jpg) 
1 I also have a toddler: it’s sad that we are in a world where these predators thrive and that we will have to find ways to explain these actions to our children.
1 I have a seven year old son, and we work constantly on consent and respect. We also spend time making sure that we don’t use slang terms for male/female bodies/parts. I don’t want to hear my son use the word “pussy” unless he’s calling one of our cats “pussy cats”. But even then, the cats are assholes and probably won’t tolerate that either. 
1 Be sure to tell your kids not to take candy from strangers and don't talk to Republicans! 
1 “Don’t grab the cat’s butthole”
1 Thing is they don't care.
1 "Stop hitting your brother with the guitar" was one for us the other day.
1 This article is originally from August, but it's been updated regularly since then:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/21/the-trump-as-toddler-thread-explained-and-curated/> White House aides can’t stop talking about President Trump like he’s a toddler
1 I agree whole heartedly except for one thing that bothers me....why are there French fries behind the TV?Hmmmm....
1 hahs so true. you'd think all these things were common sense.
1 All I could think of was "how did the french fries end up behind the television in the first place", but then again you do have a toddler.
1 i literally just had this conversation with someone. when did the republican party become one laboratory accident away from being super villains?
1 So what you're saying is democrats are the adults in the room?
1 is your wife your cousin? 
1 Yep.  They're morally bankrupt and exist for no purpose other than to continue gaining and maintaining power.
1 There is the possibility that you've been lied to and you formed your opinion on those lies. 
1 man its shame that only has 11k views.......but, pro jones comments are maybe 5 to 1 to pro moore comments, pretty good for youtube.  Love the 1 guy saying its all lies because he has a 14 year old girl and he would never let an older man date her.    Like yea, and I'm sure you'd never molest your own child, does that mean no child ever has been molested by their parent?  the lack of logic....
1 Let's get this video viral!!
1 How.  The Fuck.  Is this man possibly losing to Roy Fucking Moore?
1 [Yep, Doug Jones prosecuted people who bombed a church and killed teenage girls.](https://imgur.com/pJf8Urw)*Please spread this and [other](https://imgur.com/a/CPjbl) images about the election everywhere. It's one week away, so it's crunch time. Voter turnout will be very important.*
1 This should be higher. I was worried you were being sarcastic. Now I'm looking for onions. I hope he gets elected... I need a little faith in humanity.
1 > Dear Ivanka,> > There is a special place for men who prey on children, but it's not hell, its the white house FTFY
1 Maybe the Senate is that special place. Sigh.
1 "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!"
1 Do you really think she had moore in mind when she said that?
1 There were never the party of family values, they just claimed it.  Not really sure how they can do that now.
1 They value families. Young families, with supple children.
1 People really need to stop telling us to play nice with voters who are still supporting this president and his party. Unfriend them on Facebook. Tell them to their face how fucked up they are. Don't date them. Don't buy shit from their Etsy page. It's time for people to get fucking shunned if they want policies that benefit the rich, and hurt the most vulnerable in society, so bad that they'll put up with or defend this.
1 They should be reminded of it anytime abortion comes up. Dems need to stop playing nice when it comes to Republican hypocrisy.
1 Not family values, it's the "father's" values that matter.
1 We have the malls, the best malls.
1 If only they were capable of feeling shame in any capacity.
1 Jones needs to start going low in this shit. Go right to the line. They will play dirty when it comes down to it, everyone knows they will smear jones so jones needs to start attacking now. 
1 Yeah but what's the alternative, affordable healthcare?????!?!!!??!?!!????!!!??!!!!!!??????!!!!?!??!!
1 How is it that I've yet to see a single "Grand Old Pedophiles" comment?
1 Yes... and when we as a group will also call out the DNC for not firing and sending to jail those within the party for their multiple instances of sexual abuse... (something happening far more frequently than within the GOP)... then we can demand such things and actually hold the moral high ground on this issue.
1 Nothing dirty about the truth
1 They probably see that as persecution of states’ rights advocates.
1 Are people really that surprised?  When I think incest, I think Alabama...or Mississippi, I guess. I know I am stereotyping here, but c'mon....a lot of stereotypes don't just appear out of thin air.Q: Why don't they solve a lot of murders in Alabama? A: Because there are no dental records and all the DNA matches.
1 As nice as that would be, he could easily be sued, and lose. It's easier to prove slander, and liable than it is to prove any acts of pedophilia from 30+ years ago. Yeah, we live in a fucked up time.
1 We need all the help we can get down here. Thanks from Alabama!
1 Well they are definitely going to cancel bring your daughter to work day
1 So there *is* a special place in Hell for child molesters?
1 I'm convinced it's one of the circles.  Wasn't there one for those that bore false witness?

1 > I can say I expected better from the GOP in the deep redI remember saying "There's no way the GOP will really go for Trump."I no longer give Republican voters the benefit of the doubt. They can earn it back. 
1 Jones is polling well in a situation that is very tough to poll. The DNC needs to be fully mobilized immediately all over the state. Offering rides to the polls etc. This is a huge seat that just potentially fell in their lap.
1 to be fair alabama might be the most useless, backwards state in the union 
1 Let's also not forget that Moore is just a terrible candidate, having violated his duties as a judge badly enough to *twice* be removed from office. He has shown that he has no respect for our system of law if it conflicts with what he personally believes.
1 > Have you no decencyStop there: No. > expected better from the GOPThe central mistakes of the Democratic party right here. 
1 Evangelical Christians don't have any decency. They're the most vile and disgusting pieces of shit to ever infect our country. They have no morals or ethics and indeed they actively seek to defile and degrade goodness. Fuck them all.

1 The GOP needs to be very careful that they don't mistake a Roy Moore victory as tacit support of sexual assault from the voters. They are voting against Jones because they KNOW the senate will replace Moore with someone more acceptable the second he wins. No evangelical Alabaman ACTUALLY thinks what Moore did was acceptable and very few people are speaking out saying it didn't happen. They know it happened. He's had this reputation for DECADES.The risk is that the GOP assumes evangelicals will support sexual assault, the same way the Whigs assumed voters supported slavery, and finds itself completely unrepresented in the next election cycle, usurped by one of the other parties presently hiding within the GOP just waiting to succeed them.
1 *Should* being the operative word.
1 Unfortunately my friend, that would depend on who gets to write the history...
1 More like Jones is Arya Stark and Moore is Meryn Trant.
1 Definitely poked the bear. Let that righteous indignation flow, Doug!
1 I live in Birmingham and I can tell you that Jones's support is extremely high here. Even richer areas like Mountain Brook that voted overwhelmingly for Trump are full of Jones signs. His campaign has taken him throughout the state and they are very optimistic about their chances.
1 Moore will win. Probably by double digits. It's not going to be as close as people think it will be. Moore's base is fired up and many of them have actually said that the more the media talks about these "phony allegations" the more they actually WANT to vote for him. And then there are people like my mother who would NEVER admit to voting for or supporting Moore, but will still vote for him. Just like she did with Trump.Moore's ads here in Alabama claim that these allegations are a conspiracy by Liberals AND Establishment Republicans. This entire campaign has been really bizarre to me.
1 In Mobile here. Jones has a ton of support in the city but i fear that turnout will be low. He isn’t campaigning enough. 
1 Please vote and tell your decent friends to vote...
1 I would never have imagined it in 2015. But after 2016, I'm just wondering how far the GOP will go.Putting a child molester in the senate is a new height of depravity, but I'm sure they'll find a way to top it. 
1 I second the motion.
1 people should protest outside the white house saying signs that say "trump condones child rape"
1 Too bad both candidates from last year have multiple people accusing them of just that so you can't win either way...and I'm not talking about Bill even
1 True
1 if i could give you reddit gold i would.  you win reddit.  
1 I'm surprised he waited that long.
1 *black men who smoke oz of weedFTFY
1 If that ever happened they might start adapting conservative policies.
1 It's ironic, that Trump wants him in the senate to be a vote for Trump. So, Trumps lap dog. At the same time Moore touts himself as an independent person, independent from everyone, especially from Mitch McConnell. At the same time Moore is fawning over Trumps endorsement.Moore is sending out mixed messages...
1 You can thank the internet for that. In the past it would likely have been the reaction, mood, outrage, etc *in Alabama* that dictated whether the person was shunned, avoided, removed from the running over *accusations* unless there was actual evidence and an investigation at which point it *might* have made it to national news, particularly if he was the incumbent.
1 How's that exactly? It's hardly your fault if others elect reprehensible candidates.
1 If you still live there and/or can influence others of sound intellect and character to make sure they vote according to those tenets, then you're empowered to help keep Alabama from embarrassing itself. 
1 Your right. Now that its been found out, its been handledhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7hr7uz/conyers_resigns_setting_up_a_stark_contrast/
1 > I was not aware that Jones was involved in the killing of the four little girls in Birmingham.Might want to reword that one...
1 Yay

1 Normally I’d save this reservation for TD but some of these posters are a little dense...
1 Sarcasm is haaaaarrrd to convey in 2016-2017
1 Yeah, libs made Moore fuck underage girls 30 years ago so they could use this against him when it matters the most.Keeping  defending pedophiles pal...
1 Tru if big
1 No, seriously... Who is Jones? 
1 If they do we should vote to remove Alabama from the USA.  (Yes I know we can't, but dangit I wish we could).
1 As if it was a top destination before this.
1 Jones is running against him.  No, he's not a weak candidate; he's just not a republican and he's in Alabama. 
1 > TLDR; I'm in Los Angeles, how can I help?Leave Los Angelas. Maybe a few weeks living outside of your completely detached from reality bubble will knock some sense back into you.
1 abortion isn't any of your business.  it's the business of the family or woman who wants to have it done.  you dont get any right to tell someone what to do with their body.  
1 It's the first page of the playbook from what I've seen.
1 *Laughs in UK*
1 I wasn't aware that a criminal or civil case was required to choose not to vote for a person.
1 I think at this point the statute of limitations have expired and there is no prosecutable criminal issue here. This is part of the larger movement recently, where women are finally feeling empowered to come forward and talk about their assaults. It seems to have really ignited when Terry Crews came forward about his assault. I think people really woke up and realized it can happen to ANYONE.I was concerned at first that this would end up being a partisan attack by the left against folks on the right, but it's blossomed into a nation wide, non-partisan thing with abusers on all sides getting taken down. Truly it seems only "pro-pedo-bama" that hasn't caught on and is still trying to elect sexual predators instead of removing them. Alabama seems super evangelical though, and sexual abuse seems to be a BIG part of christian culture.
1 I agree that Moore should not go to prison until he is found guilty in a criminal trial. And he should not have to pay any damages without being found liable in a civil trial. But that’s not what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about whether we believe he is fit to serve in the US Senate. Voters are free to base that decision on all of the available information. 
1 There isn't one but apparently an allegation is enough to attempt to destroy a man's political career. Whatever it takes for that blue wave, right? I'm just surprised they didn't choose a state that would be a little easier to manipulate. 
1 Better to just donate to Jones' campaign.Clearly Alabamans hate Democrats more than child molesters, so confronting them about it would likely do more harm than good. 
1 >We elected a pedophile for the librulz tears lulz lmao rofl -- Modern Conservatives
1 I mean is having a pedophile in the US Senate worth it for all those librul tears?
1 Modern rebuplicans:Pedophiles > democrat victory You guys are some kind of twisted. 
1 Well, people tend to not like pedophiles very much.
1 Are you kidding me? The only thing that would make me happier than a Democrat winning an Alabama senate seat is the GOP electing a child molester to the senate.Can you even get lower than that? Y'all will keep harping on about "Trump won because liberals look down on us :'(" then turn around and elect a child molester to the senate.Then every GOP senator will have to decide whether to vote with a child molester and pretend he's innocent or expel him from the senate on the grounds that Republicans from Alabama voted in a child molester.I love that catch 22. Let an alleged kiddie diddler into your ranks or forever go down in history as the party who elected a kiddie diddler. The GOP lost in Alabama regardless of who wins the seat.
1 There probably should be. Everyone should be salty about a group of people so married to their political party they're rather vote in a dude who fucks around with teenagers then vote against their party.
1 Not really. I'm not expecting anything less to be honest. Wouldnt surprise me if Trump's not in there until 2024.
1 Well yeah.  Alabama electing a pedophile is something to be concerned about.  
1 eagerly looking forward to harvesting some, myself. i'm just grateful that the hypocrisy and double-standard is on full display here; though i sometimes feel bad about the impressionable nature of these poor idiots, and the sheer *naivete*, it's just fucking *sad* sometimes."oh, someone accused a democrat of sexual misconduct? FAKE NEWS! didn't happen! there's no proof! LOL conspiracy theory!" and in the next breath: "BUT PEOPLE CAME FORWARD, HE'S GUILTY IT'S SO OBVIOUS, FUCKING PEDO TRASH. IT'S BASICALLY CONFIRMED. WHAT, NO THERE'S NO CRIMINAL CHARGES OR ANYTHING BUT IT'S TRUE OKAY THERE'S A YEARBOOK LOL GOOGLE IT. WHY WOULD SOMEONE LIE ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT DURING AN ELECTION??? BELIEVE VICTIMS (unless they're conservative)"anyways, i cannot fucking wait. i'm ecstatic! it won't quite be like election night 2016, but damn, it'll still be good! edit: fucking top jej. progressives get so mad when you mock their breathless hysteria and impotent screeching. 
1 > I heard it stated that she has said that her accusations would be dropped….for money.Well if you say so it must be true.> The other woman, Nelson, claims she met Moore at a restaurant she worked at, where Moore was a frequent customer, who leered at the waitresses, making them uncomfortable. Yet, another women who worked at that restaurant for three years during that time frame, states that she does not recall Moore ever being at the restaurant, and certainly not as a regular. Nor does she remember Nelson ever having worked there.Are you willing to acknowledge your bias/logical fallacy here? - Nelson makes accusation = "This is clearly bullshit"- Anon disputes accusation = "This clearly proves Nelson is bullshit"
1 Roy Moore was banned from a mall for trolling for pubescent girls. You support a pedophile. 
1 Wow that was a lot of words to say "it's okay to sexually assault children because Alabama."
1 Holy guacamole. You okay? Too much Alex Jones for you. 
1 Yeah that's not true though. Victims have come forward about Moore forcing himself on them, and doing more than kissing. So, this is all a lie. 
1 >At that time, it was NOT uncommon for men to date and marry much younger women, this was an established practice in America, particularly the South which hewed to tradition.This is completely untrue in the time period we're talking about, in many cases we're talking about sexual assault, not innocent dating, and you are intellectually dishonest or in deep denial if you think that the argument you are making holds together.From Wikipedia:>A former colleague who worked with Moore at the Etowah County District Attorney's office from 1982 to 1985 stated, "It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls, **everyone we knew thought it was weird [...] We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall**".->On November 9, 2017, The Washington Post outlined an account of a woman, Leigh Corfman, who said that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, **when she was 14** and he was 32 years old. Corfman said that Moore met her and her mother in the hallway of the county courthouse, where Moore was working as an assistant district attorney, and offered to sit with Corfman while her mother went into a courtroom to testify. Corfman said that during that discussion he asked for her phone number which she gave him, they later went on two dates, for each date he picked her up in his car around the corner from her house and drove her to his house, and on the first date he "told her how pretty she was and kissed her". On a second date, Moore allegedly **"took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes ... touched her over her bra and underpants ... and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear"**. The alleged sexual contact between Moore and the 14 year old **would be a felony under Alabama law**, punishable by up to ten years in prison. In a November 2017 Today Show interview, **Corfman said she is proud that telling her story has encouraged others to do the same**.->Beverly Young Nelson, appearing with lawyer Gloria Allred, said she had received unwanted attention from Moore **when she was 15 years old**, and said that—in December 1977 or January 1978—when she was 16 Moore sexually assaulted her. Nelson accepted a ride from Moore after she finished work because she "trusted him because he was the District Attorney". She said that Moore stopped the car, began groping her and then **tried to force her head into his crotch**. She said that when she fought him off, he eventually gave up, but told her, "**You're just a child, I'm the district attorney; if you tell anyone about this no one will ever believe you.**"->Faye Gray, a retired detective, who is a 37 year veteran of the Gadsden police force, stated that **in the 1980s she was told to look out for Roy Moore due to his known harassment of cheerleaders** at local school athletic events. The detective said that she also had heard that **Moore had been banned from the Gadsden Mall** and also said that both in the police department and at the Gadsden courthouse there were frequent mentions of Moore liking young girls. She said "I didn’t realize until sometime later that when they said he liked young girls, I just thought he liked young ladies, you know, maybe in their 20s. I had no idea, or **we had no idea, that we were talking about 14-year-olds.**"-You are trying to justify pedophilia because of your affiliation with a political party. That's disgusting. Stop what you are doing immediately.
1 😴😴😴tldr 
1 tldr: he's a child molester and sexual predator.
1 That is alot of bs text just to be a pedophile supporter...
1 You forgot to spin him being banned from a shopping mall in the area.
1 Until now, I'd never seen a wall made entirely of horseshit. Nice job!Maybe you can help Donnie build that wall!
1 So many straw men. Don't light a match. 
1 You just wrote the longest novel in support of a pedophile since Lolita. You must be so proud :)
1 You can say whatever you want about Roy Moore. Here's what I have to say. Fuck Roy Moore. And fuck Alabama for likely electing this piece of shit.  Accusations of child touching aside his politics are terrible.
1 Well you know what they say about excuses. 
1 > Mo Brooks, the well loved congressman from Northern Alabama,Ah, yes, the same Brooks that claimed the Democrats are launching a race war against white people.
1 Lol that's a lot of words to defend a child fucker. 
1 I can't wait until the day Special Counsel Robert Mueller hands out his last and final indictment.Related: Stay away from my child by a distance of at least thousand miles, at all times.
1 Your finessed, nuanced use of CAPS tells me I should listen closely to what you have to say.  Please sir, continue.
1 What the fuck are you talking about? This happened in the late 70's. It wasn't fucking 1832. Also there isn't much difference between 18 and 30?!? Apparently you've never been 30 cause there's a shitload of difference physically. But what's even more important is the mental changes, not physical. A guy in his 30's mind works very differently than a teenager. My God the amount of bullshit you just put out is astounding.
1 Too long. Unlike your dad. His dick is too short.
1 >subvert the democratic process with BS accusations     "BUT HER EMAILS" ring any bells?
1 We still talking about Uranium One?
1 We still talking about Benghazi?
1 Now rightists care about the democratic process. 
1 Is there any of that that's relevant here?  Keeping in mind Moore is guilty as sin.
1 Does Moore dispute the allegations?
1 I mean if you want to talk about Franken we can, but this thread is about Roy Moore
1 Hi Dmitri 
1 I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean: Elections are literally a contest of moral character and experience. Cruising a mall for girls ten years younger than you may not be illegal, but it certainly is not morally defensible.
1 You seem to be making a number of mistakes so obvious that it's surprising you could make them at all.First of all, this isn't a trial.  It's an election.  Voters can consider and weigh allegations.  Second of all, in actual trials, strong convincing witness testimony is often accepted a proof by a jury.  If Roy Moore were on trial, he might very well be found guilty.  
1 I hope you understand that that's a standard for court. Rational people can make their own conclusions about guilt or innocence outside of the judicial system.
1 in the court of law yes.. but I think the statute of limitations applies here. there are likely no claims of assault recent enough to bring charges against. In the court of public opinion (which decides elections) there is no such promise of innocence until proven guilty. Folks are free to make up their own mind and vote accordingly. And the court of public opinion has already tarred and feathered him for it, there isn't really any room for nuance like "did he really do it" there.It's precisely because there is no promise of "innocence until proven guilty" in the eye of the public, that such a protection was constructed for legal proceedings. 
1 Clinton, innocent until proven guilty, amiright? 
1 hurt or had relationships with them when they were very young - are you really going to draw a line between the two?
1 you don't believe that Jones actually said this? 
1 >Is he talking about Clinton?When has anyone ever accused Clinton of molesting underage girls?
1 Multiple named sources have come out, and there are corroborating witnesses to some of them. What more do you want?
1 So Jones didn't say this? What is exactly fake about this?
1 Keep going, I almost got a bingo!
1 You're an interesting kind of special.
1 > Is he talking about Clinton?PIZZAGATE! PIZZAGATE! PIZZAGATE!
1 Who is Clinton?As far as I can see there are no Clintons running for office?Just a pedophile. 
1 Which they do..Not relevant to this at all. 
1 http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/05/woman-jailed-for-lying-that-shed-been-raped-by-detective-destroying-his-life-7132951/They do. Pedophile predators should go to jail too. 
1 What do you want, an audio recording of Moore bragging about it to Billy Bush?
1 Its not one though.  Its like, 9 different women, and 2 dozen corroborations.  
1 It's a quote...
1 Doesn't matter if she's 6 or 14, a child molester is a child molester.
1 Only a week left. I bet all Alabaman Republicans are right there with you praying for something to come out that makes Doug Jones somehow worse than a child molester.Odds are they will vote Moore anyway when that inevitably doesn't happen because you don't have to  carry the burden of electing a child molester when you can just pretend it's fake news. 
1 yeah, Jones is on video saying it
1 the testimony of the women.  they all corroborate the same things.  they were assaulted when they were young or harassed.  unless it's "fake news" as trump puts it 
1 > You seem to be making a number of mistakes so obvious that it's surprising you could make them at all.> First of all, this isn't a trial. It's an election. Voters can consider and weigh allegations.> Second of all, in actual trials, strong convincing witness testimony is often accepted a proof by a jury. If Roy Moore were on trial, he might very well be found guilty.
1 Hillary Clinton, the dude in California, and Obama, all innocent until proven guilty, right? 
1 you understand the election isn't held in a court right? If there is an allegation recent enough to actually bring charges against he will absolutely be considered "innocent until proven guilty" in the court he is tried in.. But there is NO such protection in the "court of public opinion" (which decides elections). It's for this very reason that such a protection exists in legal proceedings. 
1 False equivocation. 
1 Did Al Franken have sex with underage girls too...?
1 What the hell does the left have to do with whether or not this child sexual assaulter should be put into office?Stop deflecting. Although I know it's basically a reflex for Trump supporters at this point.
1 Al Franken is not an excuse for putting a child molester in the senate. 
1 You equate a stolen kiss between two adults with the rape of a child?Now there's your republican. 
1 In his defense, they weren't children... He's not quite good enough anymore, and doggone it people are starting not to like him.
1 You mean the guy who admitted to it and called for an investigation into his actions? Yeah, totally the same thing.
1 Al Franken apologized and the victim forgave him.
1 Al Franken took an inappropriate photo pretending to grope a woman. Al Franken wrote a kiss into a script and she agreed to it. What Al Franken did was inappropriate and he should be embarrassed and apologize for it. He should not be removed from office for a joke in bad taste he never actually groped her and she agreed to kiss him for a skit. He never raped or molested anyone... especially not a minor like someone else. 
1 yep there's whataboutism #3 that i've found.  typical 
1 > Instead of taking her home, Nelson said Moore pulled his car behind the restaurant and began to attack her."Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me and putting his hands on my breasts," Nelson said.She said she tried to open the car door to leave, but Moore locked it and continued to grab her."He began squeezing my neck, attempting to force my head onto his crotch. I continued to struggle," Nelson said. "I thought that he was going to rape me."She said she began to cry and beg him to stop and that eventually he did relent before telling her not to speak."At some point he gave up, and he then looked at me," Nelson said. "He said, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you.'"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/politics/gloria-allred-roy-moore-alabama/index.htmlEDIT: [Bonus.](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/937799838082781186?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
1 Doug Jones got a conviction on the Klansmen who killed four young girls.
1 Yes, we live in a "different reality" where fucking 14 year old girls is weird to us.I have no problem continuing to exist in my "different reality" while you continue to advocate in favor of pedophilia.Also I would loveee for you to explain to me who supports murdering babies. You know a fetus and a **fucking baby** aren't the same thing... right?
1 Hilarious. You right-wing nutjobs are so delusional.. Your minds work like this "Doug Jones wants to kill babies. Roy Moore just wants to fuck them."
1 Hilarious.  Pede is so close to pedo, we should have known this would happen all along!
1 So you're one of these idiots who thinks a zygote is the same as "baby girls and boys."Get off the computer and get back in your cave.
1 You're lying through your buck-teeth. Almost 20 accusers have come out against Moore with even more witnesses. But no, "it's all mainstream media lies". Try to use some ounce of critical thinking...
1 Embryos aren't boys or girls. Jesus fucking Christ....
1 > Doug Jones supports ~~the murder of baby girls and boys en masse~~ a woman's right to chose what to do with her own body.You may resume your pearl-clutching over unwanted fetuses now.
1 I support your agenda to enslave women to the state. 
1 Wow. Cool ethics. Pedophilia > pro-choice. 
1 > Hilarious. It's like liberals live in a different reality. Yup, we share the same reality as the rest of the developed world. American conservatives live in the reality where their ideology is superior, yet for some strange reason their policies result in lower economic growth, lower educational attainment, and higher teen pregnancy rates, to name just a few things.
1 > Doug Jones supports the murder of baby girls and boys en masse.if abortion is murder, masturbation is genocide. think of all the potential children!
1 you are still doubting all of these accusers?  He's actually now denying even knowing any of them, despite the fact that they have signed cards and yearbooks from him...you do realize that, right?
1 now he means a person, a living breathing person who was only 14 years old when he touched her inappropriately 
1 Al Franken isn't an excuse to let a child molester in the senate. 
1 > Dems protected Bill Clintonnext time Bill Clinton is running for office, I'll be sure not to vote for him.
1 If Mohammed runs for a senate seat in my state, I'll vote against him.Only a vile human being would elect a child molester.
1 There are no witnesses??? There are none so blind.
1 Imagine actually believing child molesters are better suited for the US Senate than Democrats 
1 But Moore is consistently pro-establishment  in his works, just not his words. 
1 > We need more anti-establishment candidatesnothing says *anti-establishment* like tax cuts for the wealthy elite and ending net neutrality. > bought and paid for Dems.Grrr, those Dems. Bought and paid by big solar and those public school lobbyists. 
1 ...Because he is referring specifically to a man who is doing that...this isn't just a hypothetical statement.
1 not even a lil bit sexist when you are describing your male opponent 
1 He was referring to his record bringing the murderer of a group of little girls to justice during his tenure at the Alabama state house.
1 Because his opponent is credibly accused of molesting girls and Jones himself sent people who murdered little girls to prison.
1 Ironically I think if he were accused of molesting boys he'd be in jail already. 
1 Did the case facts and massive over representation of men abusing girls in terms of child molestation trigger you?All children’s bodies matter right?? 
1 Is a woman who molested a little boy running for national office?
1 Of course.  No one is arguing against that, but there's not a Senate race involving a woman accused of assaulting boys at this time.
1 Yes 
1 Something your mom did?
1 Yes exactly like Bill fucking Clinton. Now stop being a pussy and defend it without deflecting
1 So..you approve of what Clinton did then?
1 Bill Clinton is not an excuse for putting a child molester in the senate. 
1 You're right!, I'm certainly not voting for Bill Clinton this year!
1 They're so out of arguments, they're bringing up Chappaquiddick again. Wow.
1 Who has accused Biden of molesting or assaulting them?
1 Abortion has been legal for 40 years.Deal with it. 
1 so you're an advocate for free birth control then? universal healthcare for all children? 
1 I'm not going to argue whether or not the fetus is a child. I feel that this argument is just philosophical opinion. Rather, I argue that being pro-choice is the correct way simply due to the reality that abortions will happen anyways, except when illegal they will be far more dangerous to the women and some "doctors" will take advantage of their perilous situation. I don't know why conservatives think that they can just make things illegal and that will make the problem go away. It doesn't work for drugs. It doesn't work for abortion. It doesn't work to stop LGBT people from having relationships. Additionally, I find that Republicans are not nearly as "small government " as they claim to be. When they say small government- they simply mean don't regulate/tax my businesses. As for private citizens, they are incredibly authoritarian and a "nanny state" as they like to spout. This isn't really relevant to abortion, but the hypocrisy really makes me mad. 
1 If republicans care so much about abortion, why don't they do something simple to save tens of thousands of fetuses every year from getting aborted in their state?Something like actual sex education and easy/free access to contraception?It works literally everywhere.
1 > Those who murder baby girls in the wombbabies don't inhabit women's wombs, you're thinking of zygotes and fetuses.You might as well say that jizzing anywhere other than a fertile vagina is killing millions of babies.
1 This is about Moore. Franken didn't diddle kids.
1 How's that orange dick taste? 
1 If you're going that hard on Franken I'd love to know what you think of Moore and Trump.  Oh and by the way, he wasn't a politician at the time.  Isn't that how you guys defended Trump's disgusting actions?  Sucks when the snake turns around and bites you huh?
1 And this has what to do with anything, exactly?
1 Sure, right after Trump.
1 Ah, the whataboutists are here!Save it for threads related to Al Franken.
1 The problem is that if his voters actually believed the truth, they wouldn't vote for him.  It's not that they think a child molester is worthy of their vote; it's that they believe 100% that all the different people chiming in are making it up out of whole cloth.
1 This isn't pussy grabbing. This is child pussy grabbing. Big difference.
1 Pretty sure him getting banned from the mall wasn't 30 years ago but much more recent.
1 Yep, if Alabama approves of pedophiles, right-wing extremists, religious nut jobs... and the Republican party as a whole accepts the sexual predator whacko as a leader in their party, that's on them and they should suffer the consequences of going down that path.
1 The best the republicans can come up with in Alabama is a man with credible sexual assault allegations including children, but at least he isn’t a democrat speaks more loudly to the party than it does the accused. If Moore is the best candidate they can muster, maybe people should switch their political views. It’s not like conservatives have done well for Alabama. They are bottom of the barrel in nearly every measurable mark. 
1 > What he did - or was accused of doing - was 30 years ago (or more).If he's not repentant, then it's not about 30 years ago - he still thinks this behavior is okay *now*, and will continue to do so when in the Senate. >In the end, I actually agree with Trump and McConnell's opinion that this is a matter for the voters of Alabama. That's a silly cop-out. Every election is a matter for the voters. People still can and should, and do, weigh in. Trump isn't staying out of the election, he's endorsing Moore and attacking Jones; he's not leaving it just up to the voters of Alabama. >Further, if they vote him in, I think it would be abhorrent to NOT seat him in the Senate - as this is quite actually the will of the people.You're suggesting that there shouldn't even exist the power to remove elected individuals - that impeachment should not be legal, or anything like it. That's not how this works. Our democracy isn't unlimited - this ain't Athens. 
1 the problem with that assessment is that the story broke after a majority of Alabama votes had been mailed in. Alabaman's won't get a chance to speak on the matter with their votes until next election.edit: the GOP has also very shrewdly let the Alabama voters know that the senate won't allow Moore to serve, so they can safely vote red, knowing they aren't supporting Moore, and will like just keep Luther Strange in the seat. 
1 no he hasn't been accused of courting them.  he's being accused of sexually assaulting and harassing women.  nice attempt at spinning the truth.  
1  enjoying a cup of whataboutism I see.
1 People supporting abortion doesn’t change the fact that Roy Moore abused underage girls. 
1 "children in the womb" is an oxymoron. 
1 It's pretty funny that you think this fools anybody.  First of all, if you care about embryos and fetuses you'd be in favor of nutrition and health care for pregnant teenagers, sex education that prevents unwanted pregnancies, figuring out how to deal with cases where the fetus has too many congenital abnormalities to survive outside the womb or the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, etc.  And you'd care what happens to them after they're born.  But you don't.  I'm so tired of amoral sociopaths trying to disguise their evil with cheap, intelligence-insulting soundbites about "abortion".  
1 Are you exercising later? Because this is quite the stretch.
1 It finally makes sense. Republicans want children born so they can molest them 
1 Yes. Abortions should absolutely be legal but that has nothing to do with any of this. Keep throwing shit though, something will stick I'm sure, kid.
1 I'm not going to argue whether or not the fetus is a child. I feel that this argument is just philosophical opinion. Rather, I argue that being pro-choice is the correct way simply due to the reality that abortions will happen anyways, except when illegal they will be far more dangerous to the women and some "doctors" will take advantage of their perilous situation. I don't know why conservatives think that they can just make things illegal and that will make the problem go away. It does work for drugs. It doesn't work for abortion.

This isn't really relevant to abortion, but the hypocrisy really makes me mad. 
1 Liberal social policies result in fewer abortions.  Nobody is pro-abortion.  
1 Roy Moore was clearly only molesting little girls to prevent harm to their mothers.
1 People who want fewer abortions should vote Democrat.  People who want women to suffer for having sex should vote Republican.
1 Exactly. They need to be born. And then when they're 13 - molested by Roy Moore! 
1 You just like to fuck them right after they leave the womb!
1  apparently no proof apparently no justice department they win against you your argument is what about ISM that has no relevance to the present day argument and observation
1 whataboutism.  nice try

1 Just wait until the Roy Moore abortion story drops.  Lol.
1 since when is being against kids getting raped "virtue signaling"? are you really about to make pedophilia a partisan issue? 
1 How would he do that? He's not in office. 
1 Al Franken isn't an excuse to elect a child molester to the senate. 
1 It's not just one girl, there are over a dozen allegations from different women. Many more victims have come forward about crimes that happened many years ago this year because of the Weinstein allegations. People are starting to be punished for their behavior, victims see this, and they are more willing to come forward. It's the people that don't believe them that keep people from coming forward. When your reaction to allegations is, "She must be lying since he is running for Senate" why would a victim want to go through the embarrassment and harassment of telling the story?
1 Whether he did or did not molest girls is “besides the point”? Are you just attempting to irk people or do you actually have that vile perspective? 
1 Um - whether he did it or not IS the point. Unless you're cool with electing child molesters. Why she (and all of the other women) just so happened to come forward now, is BESIDES THE POINT.
1 Moore should use that as his campaign slogan."Whether I am a child molester or not is beside the point! Moore 2017"
1 Perhaps it is because SINCE he is running for national office, national reporters went and investigated for the first time and convinced these women to come forward. 
1 First, she nor the multitude of other women came forward. They were found by journalists covering the race. Second, when would you like these victims to come forward? What's most convenient for you? When he was first running for office and they were teenagers living in a very conservative state? When he we an established politician and they feared ramifications from their conservative professional and social circle and state? Or now when you discredit them for bad timing?
1 Let’s say it’s all a lie.  Roy Moore is still a racist, bigoted, sexist homophobe that has twice been removed as a judge.  The man’s simply not fit for the Dante no matter how you look at it.  
1 You don't think seeing the guy who sexually abused you when you were a teenager attempting to gain greater power over others might not inspire a few victims to come out, despite the sham and danger of doing so?
1 Stupid people still believe that shit?
1 Debunked.
1 The only thing fake here is your account. Go back to Russia. 
1 hey, so why was Moore banned from that mall again? 
1 How dare he deprive Moore of a potential victim. 
1 I guess by that logic you support child pimping. Why are you such an evil child pimp? 
1 So you support the killing and permanent maiming of women? Banning abortion did nothing to reduce the number of abortions in this country. They just guaranteed they would be done in the most unsanitary conditions possible. thousands of women each year died or were permanently disabled because of unsterile abortions. Let me guess: you are against sex ed, or giving birth control to teenagers. 
1 if abortion is murder, masturbation is genocide. If you're going to remain ignorant, at least be consistent in your flawed logic.
1 The only reason Jones has a shot at all is because Moore is a pedophile.  There's no way a Democrat wins in Alabama under normal circumstances.  No way.  I agree with agentup, it's best to remind everyone what a demon Moore is.
1 That’s the same mistake we *continue* to make. Obviously, Trump voters broke no laws, so I am not in favor of government reprisal, but the fact that these things are allowed to sit in cubicles and have boring office conversations without being treated with horror and revulsion is not to the credit of the US.
1 > That's the same mistake everyone made with Trump during the campaign, and look where it got us.People call Hillary a harpy, but she treated Trump with that same behind-the-times professorial attitude that lost Kerry the election to Dubya.
1 >  same mistake everyone made with Trump during the campaignBullshit. The theme of the Clinton campaign was pretty much solely based on being anti-trump. Her fucking slogan was "Love trumps hate."Relying on purely attacking without building yourself up was the mistake made with Trump. Jones isn't making any mistakes, he's handled this beautifully.The fact that he has no chance of winning doesn't mean that he didn't play the game well. The deck was just stacked too high against him to be overcome.
1 Why didn't one person stand up and tell him, "Shut the fuck up you racist, fraudulent piece of human garbage"? 
1 Believe it or not, there's been some polls/studies done on certain extremely radical congressmen that have found that their constituents don't believe a bunch of things about them that are true.For example, remember the really racist Iowa congressman who among other things said illegal immigrants are cantaloupe shouldered drug mules? A lot of his constituents don't believe he actually said or advocated for such crazy blatantly racist stuff.
1 It's about reinforcing the cognitive dissonance and holding the voters' feet to the fire.  OP is right.  As long as Jones keeps focusing on professional attacks, voters can see it as a political disagreement (that Moore will almost always win because of political tribalism) rather than a fundamental failing of morals and character on the part of his opponent.  Democrats have a tendency to focus too much on logos and not enough on ethos.  Character matters to the trust we place in our elected officials, especially to conservative voters.  At least it used to.  Still probably Jones' best shot, though.
1 It makes Jones look like he is standing up for decency rather than just being the blue guy vs the red guy.
1 Statements/reminders like these are great because they arm the average voter with better rhetoric. Now, at the dinner table when Allie Bama’s crazy Uncle Red says “Jones isn’t tough on crime!”, Allie will be more likely to respond - “Doug Jones sent real criminals to jail!” This MIGHT make Red reconsider his position, but at least prevents him from instilling self-doubt in Allie, and prevents him from winning over all the other people at the dinner tablemore personal example: my uncle is a climate denier. I studied climate science. I will never be able to convince my uncle that climate change is real, but I CAN stop him from convincing the rest of my family by shutting down all of his arguments
1 The South is a bit different though. Jones could gain support by calling Moore out. I'd keep pushing him for a debate and then call him a coward when he doesn't show. 
1 > "he got fired for what he believes in" sob story....and he believes in fucking over the law. Bastard childfucker that he is.
1 Although that was a R primary, so it's basically a contest to see who can fool the most rubes on a first pass. Disagree entirely. People hate the Democrats because Dems refuse to be candid, ever. They think any little slip will crucify them and they'll lose. Turns out, all you have to do is not give a fuck what your opponents try to get you for, and it doesn't matter what they say. Which is an easily defensible moral position when your opponents are/endorse a ***fucking child rapist***
1 if it was just a case of abortions vs no abortions kind of stuff sure. But this is pedophile vs politician.If you go out and tell people why you're awesome and your policies are the bomb.com that implies that pedophilia is just a political issue to be discussed at a round table.
1 Last argument I got into, I started pointing out that former LAW ENFORCEMENT officers claim they were told to keep Moore away from young girls at certain events. Try that line and watch their heads spin with the cognitive dissonance.
1 Idk if your life situation would make this impossible, but if not, seriously consider getting yourself out of that situation. I've cut off all contact with one half of my family because it got to the point where keeping up appearances with these horrible, hypocritical people was simply not worth it. It sucks knowing that I won't get to experience all the kids on my dad's side of the family growing up and whatnot, but dealing with the delusion and hatefulness any longer wasn't something I was prepared to handle.
1 I'm in the same ship. Family believes Trump is savior and all of this is just a hoax. No mater how much proof I give them.
1 Do they seriously think WaPo and NYT just make this shit up? As if some crack team of fiction writers is just inventing these stories and slapping a real person's name on it. Or they hear some random person's story and sprint down the hallway to the printer because they're so eager to print gossip in their newspaper?
1 McConnell believes the women. Is he part of the conspiracy?
1 Not all of my family are this way, but a majority of them are, and I can’t stand it. Just one example: my grandmother has become so thoroughly brainwashed by Fox News that once she accused her daughter of being the evil liberal media since she works at CNN. Another time she cried because I told her I wouldn’t honor my Confederate ancestors...that kind of stuff. It’s amazing to me how quickly they all discredit Moore’s or Trump’s accusers as horrible, gold-digging liars, and any sort of comment otherwise means you’re just a brainwashed liberal. I know exactly how you feel.And then people wonder why victims of sexual assault are so reluctant to come forward.
1 Man, I remember an argument one guy had. He genuinely didn't believe Kansas had budget issues due to the republican admin. He said he only heard about it from the "Liberal Media,"  so Kansas is really doing great.
1 I've had someone say that too.  I asked them if they'd be fine with their underage daughter having relations with a 32 year old professional and they told me of course not but this was a different time.
1 They all just dismiss it as liberal propaganda and lies. Extremism is fermenting in this country and it’s scary
1 I am sorry brother that is rough. It will all come out in the wash tho. I don't understand this is out there and yet people support him.
1 Ugh me to its Making me sick. My guy friend goes on about how pedos should have their dicks cut off. Totally believes the Hollywood stories. But ohhhh when a story comes out about Moore. It's. "Honey they're allegations" the hypocrisy is giving me chest pains.
1 You're such a fucking prude if you haven't raped a child
1 I can understand why some victims wouldn't want to have even more of a target plastered on them like that.  The backlash for victims accusing powerful people of sex crimes (especially with all the tribalism in our current political situation) is vicious.
1 They have to be careful. If they push on it too hard, it might look more and more like a partisan hack job. By having the Democrats mention the story without forcing it out there, they avoid the appearance of partisanship.What they SHOULD do is get a generic sounding third party to run clips of the Republicans who have condemned him. 
1 That's because you believe only right wing trash:>Those woman are being paid to do that to Moore. The Washington Post offered a girl 1k just to say that. Now his wife is going sue about it. -youSo, you believe a random Twitter user but not this woman. Gee wonder why??https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2017-11-15/washington-post-didnt-pay-roy-moore-accusers
1 That’s because you don’ actually give a shit about protecting children. Basically you’re scum.
1 That's because it's Gloria Allred.
1 These are the same people who handwave and clutch their pearls at the imagined threat of Sharia Law.
1 > A 14 year old girl married a 74 year old man, according to the Frontline data.WHAT
1 > So does Alabama culture pride themselves on child marriages?here's the problem: the more liberal america hates something, the more the right seems to embrace it.for example, air pollution wasn't part of conservative pride until the american left started driving priuses.  but now they are *for air pollution.*  likewise if "being against pedophilia" somehow becomes a liberal position, which weirdly seems to be becoming the case, then the right will take the opposite view in reaction.
1 Wait, Child marriages are legal in the USA?How is this allowed?
1 I'm immensely confused by this. Is this like some fucked up loophole to get around child molestation charges? Why are so many people marying children?
1 Alabama is 1/5 the population of Texas.  So, in a per capita sense, Alabama outpaces Texas by a bit.
1 Wait. You can still marry kids in the US? That’s fucked. 
1 Lol. I remember a bunch of fake images of Muslims marrying child brides floating around the Donald and other right wing communities. Funny that they aren't saying anything about this! Jesus Christ. 
1 All this normalizing is bullshit.  Remember they banned Moore from the local mall for creeping on teenagers, so it's clearly considered unacceptable to them.
1 Roll tide?
1 And poisoning trees in the name of college football rivalries.
1 >So does Alabama culture pride themselves on child marriages?Apparently it's their commodity.
1 No, and it sickens me that my former state would sink this low.Liberals in Alabama always expect stupidity from Republicans and it sucks but for the most part we could deal with it because there are pockets of liberalism in Alabama.But Doug Jones isn't even liberal.  If he were running in Vermont or Oregon or California, he would be considered a traditional republican.  He literally just doesn't believe that gays are evil and maybe taxes should be a little higher on the rich.
1 Wait they actually allow them?!
1 .. Alabama "culture".. 
1 Honestly, I live in Alabama and have my whole life, and I do know of one child marriage, but it was a 15 year old to a 17 year old, which was just a poor decision on the parents part, but whatever. It was weird being in tenth grade and having a friend get married. Other than that I literally have never heard of this and am actually shocked at that. Like, where the FUCK is that going on? 
1 Child marriage is an older custom, and based on the idea that women are baby making factories, thus they should get started as soon as possible. It's an oddly pragmatic approach, however, it ignores the happiness of the girls. We've decided as a society that girls should enjoy their teenage years and delay having children. 
1 How is this legal? Does marriage allow for underage sexual contact? 
1 This is some ancient shit though, right?Or? ELICalifornian, anyone ? 
1 ...God damn Alabama is Fuuuuuc........Fuck...
1 They're going to vote for Moore, so yes.  People vote for those they can relate to most.
1 God damn it Texas, again?
1 That's absurd. I didn't think that happened at all here, let alone so recently. Wtf US
1 Roll Fucking Tide?
1 It's one of those things you say you don't support, but in practice you do.Kinda like when Alabamians say they believe Jesus was right when he said we should help the poor, but they don't actually support the practice of that.It's basically "opposite state", or AKA, "backwards".
1 Not dissimilar to the Islamic religion they purportedly detest because of, partially, child marriages.   ahaha
1 These same people got very upset about fabricated allegations that the Clintons were running a child sex trafficking ring out of the basement of a pizza parlor. One guy was so upset that he drove up there and started shooting it up until he saw there wasn’t even a physical basement in the pizza parlor. But when their guy has a past of molesting children, they don’t care. 
1 Al' Abama is only #4 in child brides?!
1 Not defending Alabama, but wouldn't a "child marriage" also include two 16/17-year-olds having a shotgun marriage? 
1 It's amazing what blinders with crosses on them can do.
1 Nah, we really don’t man... though I can definitely see how it comes across that way. Here’s the real issue, folks around my generation (I’m 35) and younger are ready for a change. We get on social media, we meet up at bars, and we talk around our dinner tables about how fucked this is. But come Dec 12 we don’t fucking show up to vote. I don’t understand our apathy. 
1 It takes a lot for me to realize that there is a state shittier than Idaho. Holy hell, a meteor could wipe out Alabama and nothing of value would be lost.
1 I'm from Alabama and this is the first time I'm hearing about all this, but I moved to Hollyweird like 6 years ago. I'm honestly disgusted about all this. I love Alabama and I wish my home was better. 
1 Holy shit man... Woah.
1 And not a single person in the country is surprised this happens in red states. Not even conservatives. They can justify child rape by marrying their victims, I suppose. You know, family values.
1 in the vast majority of these marriages the child is also not allowed to initiate a divorce or annulment because they are not an adult yet
1 If you could view the average Alabama wank bank.It would be filled with memories of seeing their young cousin in her bathing suit.
1 Not as much as Texas does, apparently.
1 Wait what the fuck child marriage is an actual thing that happens on a regular basis in the South?And these people cry out about Sharia law holy fucking hell.
1 You know... Alabama doesn't seem so bad compared to Texas. How come Alabama gets the rap that it does but not Texas?
1 I wouldn't be surprised if they're not getting pedophile sex tourism with those numbers. Imagine THAT come to Alabama commercial. Robert Trent Jones golf trail be damned.
1 They do. They also have a lot of inbreeding!
1 **BUT MUSLIMS** /s
1 It’s really hard being a liberal yankee living in Alabama surrounded by all this insanity. My representatives do not represent my views, which is why I’m voting on dec 12. 
1 Wait. I'm from Texas. I thought the legal marrying age was 18. How does this happen?
1 >So does Alabama culture pride themselves on child marriages?I'm not from Alabama, but I am from a neighboring state. It's not "Alabama culture" per se, although people certainly make fun of rednecks on that point. Rather, when you dig into the details you see child marriages in a small subset of hardcore evangelical christian communities.  Certain baptist churches, certain Pentecostal churches, certain other fundamentalist bible churches and the like. Churches that emphasize the dominance of the man in the household, and the idea that women should be subservient. These communities tend to live in rural areas and tend to keep among themselves to a certain degree. Someone who lives in a large city like Mobile or Birmingham may not even have ever met anyone that married a teenager. But on the other hand, it is frighteningly common in certain rural areas. 
1 No. It's Evangelical Christian culture.
1 More than 3,800 children were married between 2000 and 2010 in the state of New York.
1 Jesus Christ in a chicken basket.When Moore stood up at his church's pulpit and gave his address that liberals don't represent Alabama's supposed values, I actually agree with him wholeheartedly. I would take gay Socialism over hurting children very day of every week forever. Alabama is so far removed from my own personal sense of civilization, they may as well be a completely different nation. The GOP Tax Bill effectively makes church pulpits fundamentally no different than political podiums now.
1 ive never been married but isnt there like a legal process you have to go threw?like who ever is in charge of making things offical.. did they just see a 70yr and a 14yr and keep going..like if i worked at a place that did marriage liscense or whatever and that couple walked in the door id call the cops.. 
1 Do they have the data on per capita? They might be 4th overall but Texas has near 6 times the population. 
1 >Back in May 2001, a bill was introduced into the Alabama Senate that sought to raise the age a person can marry from 14 years-old to 16. But during a late night filibuster, the bill failed to passWTF?!?!?!?!?!??
1 Southern pride 
1 This may very well get buried simply bc so many have posted, but oh well.I'm a pastor of a mainline denomination church in a big city in Alabama. Many in our congregation are against Moore, including those who are predominately republican (which is a significant number of the congregation).  However, city Alabama and rural Alabama are very different places.A good friend of mine took a job as a pastor in a very small, very poor town in an extremely rural part of Alabama.  He was in his mid 20's and single. Within 2 months of him being there, he had 2 families come and try to set him up with their daughters, who were both under 18. He quickly, and definitively shut it down. Told them and many others that was a dangerous and destructive mindset not just for their daughters but for their church and their town. I say all of that to hopefully let people know that Alabama, for all our faults, is still filled with a lot of rational, level-headed people who are trying to break years of cultural decisions that have allowed horrible practices and beliefs to grab hold and do serious damage. Breaking any type of cultural cycle is incredibly difficult and it takes years. We have great people all over our state doing great things. Hopefully those things will start to catch on and push out the other junk.
1 Can we just get rid of Alabama and other states that do this? I don't want to be associated with Alabama Americans as a NYer, we don't do this weird fucked up shit. Go to Saudi Arabia if you wanna be a weird creepy fuck. 
1 Holy shit, that was between 2005 and 2015. That's Warren Jeffs territory. Jesus.
1 Oh fuck me. Texas. My home state. Back to 0 days without a national embarassment.
1 It's more of a "I believe in this thing and I will twist and force reality into the shape it needs to be to conform to this belief."I've lived in Alabama for 12 years now and I love living here. There are so many good things about this state, but there are problems and they're not small. They eclipse and mask ALL the good and the spot light that the senate race has cast has made so many people around here double down on weird ideas that cast the whole state in a bad light.   Because it's easier to both their minds and hearts (and pride) to blame the northern elitist left. They would rather put their time, energy, money, and faith into the idea that the Roy Moore's accusers are a leftist conspiracy than to admit that they share ideological similarities to a man who is accused of sexual misconduct and that better he be in the senate than a Democrat.     
1 Roll Tide 
1 What's that middle eastern country that also does this? 
1 40,000. That’s like half the population. 
1 Marrying a child provides a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
1 These days, even conservatives like Mitt Romney are considered too liberal. The guy they nominated to be their candidate just five years ago.
1 And anything not overtly racist is considered "out of the mainstream" in Alabama
1 This is the state where they bombed an abortion clinic.So, to answer your question, Yes.
1 Apparently this position is considered "not pro-right" in Alabama?
1 I'm sure there will be non-partisan "poll watchers" in Black precincts who fly confederate flags and may or may not just straight up be state troopers.
1 Oh yeah, that's why I'm still sadly cynical of the Dems chances despite close polling. There is going to be ALL sorts of election day fuckery to depress turnout in Black and liberal areas.
1 > The Secretary of State in AL said that a Jones campaign ad that amounted to "people will know if you voted, you can't sit this one out" is voter intimidation.Oh FFS. 
1 Eh, reminds me of [confessions of a republican](https://youtu.be/LiG0AE8zdTU?t=230)
1 Oh hell yea, I remember a couple of years ago when AL shut down a lot of DMVs so people couldn't get IDs to vote.
1 > I'll be surprised if we don't see polling precincts in Birmingham and other major population centers get moved or shut down all over the day before voting.and when it doesnt happen?
1 You may have a point.Just look at his cabinet members
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNMQqh1ovlM
1 “Strong on crime” literally just means arrest minorities.
1 But to them, better a pedophile than a Democrat. 
1 The only thing worse than a child molester is a democrat
1 What happened to our old fashioned values!!
1 None of the people credited with writing "Sweet Home Alabama" are actually from Alabama. (In the unlikely event that that needed to be said.)
1 Yes, a majority of Americans support child molestation. You're correct. Congratulations, you must feel smart.
1 >when evidence has already been fakedYou made this up. And we both know he molested these girls. The thing is, you don't see a problem with a 30+ year old man raping children.And "innocent until proven guilty" applies to the courtroom. Personal opinion is an entirely different matter. Would you honestly leave your little girl with Roy Moore?But anyway, were you thinking about "innocent until proven guilty" when you were yelling "Lock her up!"?
1 You know, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but every time I do that for the GOP I get turned over a barrel. 
1 The evidence is very persuasive. It's impossible for Moore to be "proven" guilty since these allegations are beyond the statute of limitations, so voters have to make their choices based on the information available. 
1 Which is why we aren't saying he should go to jail, but that the GOP shouldn't be endorsing him. Hell, we would even take GOP senators calling for an investigation. The fact is, there would be slander and/or libel lawsuits if these things were not true, but Moore, nor his Party or campaign, has done that. Instead they have been going with narratives such as, "He likes innocence..." or "Jesus' mom was underage too," and of course, lets not forget their favorite, "It is all a liberal conspiracy."
1 that's just utter bullshit. there have been plenty of sexual harassment  accuers in hollywood lately, and they're more than happen to go "SEE? SEE? before the person responds with an apology. what makes moore any different? these women have legit stories, and i forget what other details i read, but it all just added to moore's behavior. i think it was sheriff being warned to not let moore near the cheerleaders or some shit? yeah here it is: http://uproxx.com/news/roy-moore-kept-away-from-cheerleaders/
1 I might feel bad for McConnell if he wasn't a sociopath.
1 Party before country has never been more right.
1 Mitch McConnell has no soul
1 They'll boot him once they have the seat secure. 
1 He doesn't care. He's secretly thrilled to have one more vote in his senate.
1 They only pretended to care when they thought it would cost him the race. Now that his poll numbers are bouncing back they're eager to welcome him into the fold.
1 Greedy Old Pedophiles
1 yeah, it's everything to do with their ability to WIN. the tax scam sent a very clear message, that the GOP doesn't have any driving political or moral agenda. they're not trying to steer america in the right direction. they're purely after political victories. even if that means voting millions off healthcare or welcoming child molesters into their ranks, it doesn't matter to them. whatever gives them more WINs
1 Yesterday (December 4th): [Mitch McConnell flips on Roy Moore, saying Alabama voters will determine his fate](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-flips-on-roy-moore-saying-alabama-voters-will-determine-his-fate/).
1 The saddest part is that it isn't new. We've studied this stuff *extensively* since the 1940s. We know how this works. Guys like Sartre wrote extensively about the etiology of hate. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Jewish and European intellectuals wrote about the development of hate in Europe through the 1930s. We're just ignoring literal *volumes* of history. 
1 Their news isn't telling them it's credible. Their news is saying it's just liberal propaganda come to take their rights away.
1 IMO the only really bad one was the 14 year old. The rest is "culture."What I truly don't get is why we haven't changed age of consent laws. If everyone's moral sensibilities are offended to this extent, why the fuck is it still legal to marry a 16 year old?Everyone keeps bringing up how bad the behavior is, but no one speaks up about the legalities. 
1 The big issue I’ve seen is what Jon Oliver pointed out “whataboutism”.I asked my friend what he thought about Paul Manaforts charges and multiple passports under false identities as well as his multiple trips overseas under those false identities.His response? “Seems odd, but what about x, y, z”Conservatives realize their party is corrupt but when they think the liberals are ten times worse.They’ll point to the Weinstein’s, the Charlie Roses, Bill Clinton, etc as examples.But with democrats/liberals they at least seem to address the issue these days.Their pious false morality is just that and they believe the left are hypocrites for trying to hold Moore responsible.It’s made our politics completely broken where both sides are taking past each other and predators like Moore get to sneak past all the outrage.It’s left me feeling completely hopeless for the future of the US.People like Susan Yates, Mueller and to a lesser extent Comey at least give me some hope that there are a few adults left in DC. Well at least one now.
1 That's exactly it: they've had a heavily, consistently funded megaphone of a machine blasting brainwashing noise at them for a long while now. Many fear and hate others who don't align with them. Some can easily justify a pedophile by saying that the democrat will support abortion (even though Jones is on record saying he supports not changing the current Alabama law that people are "fairly comfortable" with). Constant brainwashing that's heavily funded.
1 No, this is textbook religious indoctrination. There are a disturbing amount of cults that end up with child predators.
1 You'll just have to find new ways to keep them afraid once brute strength stops working. Fortunately, once they're bigger than you, they like things like money and girls (or boys, to be fair)--so there's a weakness that can be exploited. 
1 It lasts long enough to civilize them.
1 I got taller and stronger than my dad when I was 17. But then he realized he could pinch me and apparently that's my achilles heal. So yah. Just find a way to hurt them that doesn't involve brute force and you'll continue to control them well into their 30's.
1 Why not hit the gym? You can be jacked as hell in that time.
1 Dad strength may have it's limits, but psychological warfare is always effective. When I was 19 and came home for the summer, my dad ambushed me at the front door. Grabbed me by the collar and lifted me clear up against the wall.To be clear, my dad has never once hit me in anger, he's an amazing father. And I had done judo since I was 9 years old.Stunned, I said hello and asked what was going on. He smiled and just said "Just proving I still can!" We both laughed.Thing is, I am now 30. I know I could kick my dad's ass. But I think about that moment and how he scared the shit out of me. He wins.... again.
1 Dad here to let you know that Dad-strengths has no limits.
1 I was 16 when I wrestled my dad and he said "the day has come...the son is stronger then the father." So you got a few good years left. Get your body slams in now before it's too late.
1 Hit the gym and get some gains, bro.
1 Yeah, but dads tend to be able to take a punch better than juvenile males.
1 Martial arts, gymnastics.  Make them appreciate and responsibly use that strength.
1 > I dread the teenage years where they will be as big as me and probably stronger. Dad strength has its limits.Start getting buff now so you can never not kick the shit out of them #ProTip
1 It's called pepper spray or a taser /s
1 Piece of advice... actually more like using you as an experiment, but whatever!I read that playing "The Opposites Game" is a fun way to train kids to think before they act (executive function). Like read a book with them, then ask questions about the book as if its opposites day... if its day, they say its night, etc. Its a headache if you do it too much, but it flexes that part of the brain that kids need to flex before they become grown.A lot of the crazy stuff you have to warn them about is probably stuff they already know... they just act before they think much. Flipping that behavior is apparently not hard, and pays HUGE dividends long term.
1 Start hitting the gym. Just takes a few years of strength training to get to a pretty high level.

1 You have until they turn 18 to turn your body and mind into weapons with the sole purpose of preventing them from beating you at anything. After that, you can rest.

1 "Obama said not to stick your tongue in the electrical socket."
1 > "Touch the hot stove. *Now listen to Rush Limbaugh tell you it was really the freezer that burned you from across the room.* Now, touch it again."FTFY.
1 The problem here is that the “democratic electrical socket” needs to be the voters and if the republicans are sticking their tounge on us all the time... we have to shock them or they will never learn.
1 My hope is that we can make sure they *don't* thrive by the time they're old enough to understand. The youth vote has no tolerance for this shit. We just need time. 
1 And yet a conservative FB friend would rather turn off the TV than explain why those two men on TV are married.
1 Nothing in this world teaches children the meaning of consent like a cat. I'm bummed for kids that grow up without one.
1 "Dad, Bobby is being a vulva again!"
1 Likely because said toddler put them there in the first place and nobody noticed.
1 Just one of life's many, daily, toddler-related mysteries.
1 "Any functioning adult 2020!"
1 Yep!
1 I, like most adults, tend not to form my opinion based on what I'm *told* by just anyone. The fact that Moore's accusations are credible and the tax bill will hurt Republican constituents are as factually sound as anything you'll find regarding public policy. That's why the *only* sources of information which reject those facts are sources with a history of factually unsupported reporting and strong ideological bias. But those sources aren't actually reporting to me--they're reporting for people who are looking for a reason, *any* reason, to reject what everyone else is saying.Sources still insist that the earth is flat, too. But I have the intelligence to disregard that noise, as well.
1 It's a lack of empathy. Conservatives are literally (not figuratively) incapable of understanding that other people might act/be different than them.
1 Make it go viral.  We could use social media to find some Dems in Alabama to start sharing it.If anything, this is what the debate should be about at this point.  With as many women as have come forward and as much digging as I'm sure all the press has done, it's all but established fact that Moore is a serial sexual abuser.  We should be talking about Jones at this point.  In any rational debate, you would be, because Moore's history of sexual abuse would automatically disqualify him.  But in this current social/political climate, I think people fear that it would hurt Jones' chances to talk about his policies, voting history, etc, because it would remind the moderate right wing voters of all the things they don't like that Jones supports.  And apparently those things are more important that his REPEATED SEXUAL ABUSE.
1 It's like it didn't even occur to him that the 14 year old met with Moore without her mother's knowledge. Despite that being exactly how she described it.
1 Which still doesn't work because Roy Moore preyed on daughters of single mothers in the midst of custody battles. Outside his DA office!
1 Exactly... The difference is virtually unbelievable. I'm having a hard time grasping it as well. I assume it has a lot to do with religion in some manner, but it's damned odd. 
1 As an Alabamian, it's not all that surprising TBH.
1 Because it's Alabama
1 Because the Democrats have so much misplaced faith in the "process" that they fail to honestly express their views. If Jones actually called him a rapist pedophile in those exact words, it'd do more for him. 
1 Republicans have no standards and liberals vote for people in a vacuum. If the average American could be trusted show up and vote their preference, the GOP would cease to exist.
1 People would rather have a pedophile than a Democrat in office.
1 It's because of fake news making them believe it's not credible. They think it's all lies. Also Doug Jones needs the black vote and they might not be motivated enough to get out and vote.
1 One word: Alabama 
1 Because he hates babies and he's "weak on crime", despite literally being a successful prosecutor. 
1 Alabama is a shit hole.
1 Because Republicans belong to a tribe. They do not vote for who is best. They vote for their tribe. 
1 Moore ended up in that special place after touching her in her special place.
1 It was in direct response to Moore.http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/ivanka-trump-roy-moore/index.html
1 they can claim a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut for the rich is helping the poor, and that food stamps are somehow stealing money from hardworking blue collar people. They'll just keep spouting off lies and doublethink, they don't care what's right and wrong
1 Their family values don't apply to same sex families, poor families, non-Christian families not in the process of conversion (praise God!), single parent families, or families not conforming to a traditional patriarchal hierarchy.  When they say family values, they really mean two-parent middle to upper class white protestant cisgender heterosexual Christian family values.
1 Family values just means anti-gay.
1 Of course they can, and they will, because facts don't matter. 
1 I agree.  I want to pull them all into a public square and publicly ridicule them.  When I go to Walmart or am stopped at a traffic light, when I'm outside the city, I'm primed for it.  Talk about a powder keg.  Just light it already.
1 shame gets in the way of profits 
1 The only shame they feel is when they think about voting Democrat and their neighbors finding out
1 Sociopaths don't feel shame. 
1 "You wouldn't want Roy Moore in a voting booth with your underage daughter. So when you go in a voting booth next week, consider rather or not you really want him in the Senate."
1 YES.I've been saying this for MONTHS now. Democrats need to take the kid gloves off. Stop treating these people like they deserve respect. They don't. Treat them like the fucking disgusting child-molester apologists they are. Get dirty. Call them out. Don't be polite about it. Taking the high road only works when your opponents are capable of feeling shame. 
1 My wife is from Alabama...But yeah, that's pretty much it.
1 I am certainly not a lawyer, but the way I understand libel law in the US is that it would be incumbent on Child Predator Roy Moore to prove that he was not a Child Predator. And the bar for child predation isn't necessarily a conviction. Jones could say that a ban from a local mall for child predation is suffient proof that the claim is based on evidence. Moore would also have to go through the Discovery process in a civil suit which would just drag up all the evidence against him. I think it would be unlikely that Moore would file suit. Dems have to play dirtier if they are going to appeal to the modern electorate. 
1 Let Moore sue him. Let's see Moore lie about all this shit under oath. Yeah that's what I thought. He won't sue.  
1 > They can earn it back.Don't hold your breath.
1 It's an opportunity, sure.But the GOP vote like a motherfucker.  It's like a zombie swarm every election, every time.  I wish the dems luck (not a democrat myself) because this entire fiasco is just heartbreaking. 
1 I hate to say it but the difference in winning really is the abortion issue. It's the one thing Alabama conservative women cling to like men cling to their guns. If Jones was pro-life, he'd actually pull it off. 
1 We are! We've been canvassing like crazy and are offering rides to the polls. This past week everyone's really stepped up, we might actually have a chance and people are feeling that.  Let me know if you want a yard sign. 
1 > The DNC needs to be fully mobilized immediately all over the state.They tried that with Ossof in a much less Republican district and it backfired. People hate it when national parties interfere in their local elections. You do not want to turn this into a Republicans vs Democrats fight. Not in Alabama.
1 given the DNC's apathy for races that aren't president, it would not surprise me if they're only half trying here because they see it as more ammunition to go nuts in 2018.

1 I keep "joking" about it: we need to be burned down. All of it. Plant some trees once the fire burns out.Leave a trail of gasoline to Mississippi and the upper part of Florida before you light the match.
1 Exactly. "Was your daughter ever at the mall with Roy Moore?"
1 Valar Morghulis.
1 The difference is that you knew that Arya was always going to win. I'm not so sure that Jones is going to.
1 [Rare video of Roy Moore viewing the 1980 high school graduates](https://imgur.com/axfy5jy.mp4)
1 Nice to hear that. I hope as many previous Strange voters cross over as possible. Strange did well in rich, predominately white suburbs.
1 Well, he has been shoring up the AA vote in the black belt. Jones was in Selma a couple of days ago. Well, also, it is impossible to be everywhere. He was in Baldwin county back in October. Maybe he visited Mobile then too. 
1 They're already decent because voting is a thing they do without needing to be told.
1 Murder on Fifth Avenue
1 Uh... what?
1 You uh... Have any evidence of that or are you just making a things up? 
1 Poor people, also.  White trash like me are not very protected.
1 Basically, dont call pedophiles people who deserve to be in jail because then you'll turn into a pedophile and give tax payer money to rich people and dismantle healthcare? A+ logic.
1 A dozen accusers and nearly 100 corroborating witnesses, including police officers, plus his creepy messages on year books from the time period is PLENTY of evidence. It's a metric ton of evidence.  It's far more evidence than you have in most criminal convictions.  If you won't accept any evidence except going back in time 40 years to administer a rape kit to a 14 year old, you're being completely unreasonable. 
1 The sad part is he endorsed his son to replace him on his death bed and said this too shall pass. 
1 Oh no! Thank you
1 That was pretty much my point... how in the world anyone could think this was a serious post is beyond me.
1 It's intentional. [Number 8 on the list in this essay.](http://marker.to/at3Phb)
1 Try reading that post again...
1 Careful, I'm from Texas and I know people say the same thing ;)
1 There's a reason virtually all of the major vacation destinations in the US are in blue states (or blue cities in red states).
1 nice trolling.  reported 
1 You are dead wrong. How did Cosby end up in court? I'll tell you why there are no charges, the accusations are entirely unfounded and the man is innocent.
1 A(n) allegation- At least 5 independent allegations with over a dozen corroborating testimonials.
1 it's as if it wasn't chosen at all, it just so happens the republican candidate is well-known as a pedophile.
1 > an allegationMore than half a dozen, backed by documents and court records, with reports of this same behavior from a lot of people, including local police.The documents haven't been verified, to the extent that 40 year old yearbooks and cards could, and the court records just show that the first (14 year old) victim's story checks out chronologically, but it's not as if this is some made-up, crazy conspiracy. 
1 Yup just your everyday guy gets banned from a Mall of stalking underage girls conspiracy theory right?
1 Trump supporters: "These are just allegations! Stop ruining this man's life for political standing!"Also Trump supporters: "A pizza restaurant is actually a secret headquarters for a Clinton-controlled deep state pedophile, child smuggling, and child murder ring. The Clintons personally had Seth Rich murdered to prevent this from coming to light. Also, they're all Satan worshippers and blood magic users."
1 One allegation is questionable. 5 is a little more damning. 
1 Listen - since you seem to be on the republican side of partisanship ; this is what i'll say.  Why the actual fuck, does it matter if someone is republican, or democrat, or libertarian or independent?  Why the shit can't people just work together, and if someone has made an ALLEGATION then look into it before either A.) Dismissing it, or B.) Accepting an allegation as fact.  The issue with Moore and a few others is the following ; they're long political career and the fact that there is multiple accusers.  The thing I don't get is this,  why does it fucking matter if someone is democrat and saying this?  That should literally not matter two shits.  Care about a person's humanity and not about their fucking political affiliation.  Off my soap box. 
1 Yeah, i mean there's an easy way to avoid multiple allegations of child molestation - don't molest children.  That probably would've solved Roy's problem. 
1 It’s more than just an allegation. Republicans need better candidates. 
1 Mmmhm. And tell me how you feel about Senator Franken?
1 Probably because the allegations are true.
1 Are you sure Alabama's problems aren't their own? Kind of a big accusation to throw at Democrats, implying they'd be manipulating politics in a region they can barely touch when there's better targets around. By your own logic it doesn't make any sense. As an aside, it's honestly more probable Russia tampered with the general election than Democrats messing with Alabama's anything. Sounds crazy to read right? Because that's exactly where we're at now in this madness. Reality's finally stranger than fiction, and damn if the story isn't absolutely moronic. But no yeah, it's definitely those free health care, public education touting, demoshills. Yeah those guys are the ones ruining it for the rest of us, and especially for this sincere, and upstanding politician... who has no track record of this type of behavior whatsoever. He's a total peach, preferably unripened in his case though.
1 You may want to do a little further reading it's more than one and it's clear he's guilty.  It's messed up that you think it's a blue/red thing, Moore prayed on these girls, that's the issue you should be focusing on.  Nuts.
1 I'm a conservative and a Trump supporter, its very likely he did it the circumstantial evidence is just to much. It sucks because Jones's view on abortion is extremely fucked up, but I don't live in Alabama so I wont even get to vote. Its a tough one for sure if you are pro life. One way to look at it is if Moore lines up with your values policy-wise he can be voted out of the senate in 4 years.  
1 Solaire would be very disappointed in you.
1 Pretending that all the nonsense you just said is true, does that actually make it okay in your head that Roy Moore gets elected, even though it's almost a certainty he sexually assaulted young girls?
1 > eagerly looking forward to harvesting some, myselfYet you lot are always baffled when we accuse you of being fueled by hate and spitefulness...
1 What a fucking embarrassing display of pettiness and ignorance this comment is
1 >"oh, someone accused a democrat of sexual misconduct? FAKE NEWS!You can keep trying to sell this lie, but it's still a lie. When Democrats are accused of sexual misconduct, other Democrats rapidly censure them. When the same happens to the GOP, they hem and haw about credibility and presumption of innocence.
1 "It's OK because it was normal back then"
1 Dating younger women was normal back then and legally allowed by the law.  Many of the stories are from serial liars and have huge holes in their stories that are being passed off as 100% fact.
1 Wow the left knows about Slick Willy's lolita express?
1 What of it?  Another case of Hillary engaging in crime and the media helping her get away with it.  Just as this is a case of the media creating some perception of Moore being guilty when they have nothing.
1 No, sillly ... we're talking about Benghazi. Or emails or something.
1 Without a shred of evidence? That's unusual to say the least.
1 There's proof? 
1 Found guilty of what? Every "evidence" against him has fallen apart. Just the old trick of pulling out some woman from 40 years ago that will accuse someone of sexual harassment/rape, and it always happen just before an election, what a coincidence right? But voters are not buying this anymore, democrats have tried this trick one too many times.
1 And rational people will decide that they won't sacrifice the Constitution just because Democrats have turned to their old trick of pulling out some woman from 40 years ago that will accuse the conservative candidate of rape, and it always happens just before an election, amazing coincidence right?
1 Well one being illegal and one being legal there already exists a very big line between the two. 
1 Never.  But trump said he's a rapist and I don't think for myself and just parrot trump so that's what I believe
1 Clinton is Satan to them, so he's guilty of everything
1 If there’s an allegation out there, some nut job somewhere has leveled it against a Clinton 
1 I’m willing to bet he won’t even reply, and definitely not with some sort of proof backing his claim.
1 He's talking about pizzagate. Seriously. Unironically. 
1 He was a frequent flyer on that sketchy dude's private sex jet.  Which /supposedly/ had underage girls on it all the time.
1 What world do you live in where letting someone do something doesn't equal consent? 
1 I suppose but maybe quotes should be left to the article and not used to make clickbait titles.
1 If there is anything on Jones, I am certain WaPo isn't going to report it.
1 Can you give me a specific woman?
1 Guess we'll see what the court sa- oh wait, none of their stories would hold up in court, hence why no one has even tried. Oh, and the lawyer representing the only case with "evidence" (a year book with a fake signature that they won't turn over for examination) is under investigation and has dropped off the face of the earth. Crazy how that works out, huh
1 You do know that a fetus and a baby ARE the same thing, right?  You just play mental gymnastics to justify your guilt and ease your conscience from the fact that you are murdering babies.
1 Remember "Pizzagate"?  Yeah...you're arguing with someone who believed in motherfucking "PIZZA....GATE."
1 They had their pet handwriting analysis guy (the same one who “debunked” Obama’s birth certificate, I think) come out and say that the signatures are fake. 
1 How old are you?  If you're 20-30, yeah, the HS memories are fresh. 60-70? try remembering everyone you knew in high school and everything you signed.Wanna tell me where he 'hurt' people
1 I agree! And Roy Moore isn't an excuse to back a Franken 2020 run. I want both parties to call out all sex criminals all the time. Not just when it's politically convenient. Notice how in the beginning I said I'm upset that President Trump supports him.
1 That is exactly the toxic hypocritical mentality that I'm trying to call out. Now that Bill Clinton is not seeking office, you are okay with disavowing his actions. Last year, however, I'm assuming you had no problem pulling the lever for Hillary who, in several situations, coerced Bill's victims into silence.Also, you seem to be implying that I was advising people to vote for Moore. However, if you review my original post, you'll note that I agreed with the title of the article which stated that the Senate is no place for child predators. The same standards need to be applied across the board for predators and criminals in both parties. Every time.
1 "Only a vile human being would elect a child molester."    Sorry, our two party system only allows for the realistic election of one of two evils.    Most if not all of the "child molestor''s voters will either not believe that he's done anything that he's accused of, or they'll choose what they view as the lesser of two evils.  That doesn't make them vile, that makes them normal American voters.    Maybe if people would stop supporting their one party so strongly, we could have other parties.  But the lines are drawn.  
1 No one's a child molester.  Or do you honestly believe clear fake news allegations?  It doesn't matter:  Only one candidate would provide tax cuts, anti-abortion and hard on crime, and Democrats are against all three, ergo, Alabama needs to vote against Jones. 
1 Who knows. If there were more women running for office there would certainly be at least slightly higher odds.
1 You're fucking stupid if you think that's what I was getting at
1 It's old as balls, but aside from that, is there any reason its not relevant? 
1 Yeah the left has been out of arguments for a few years now, we know.
1 *Slavery has been legal for hundreds of years.**Deal with it.* 
1 It’s typical republicanism: *Rules for thee but not for me*.The right only demands accountability for dems.
1 My understanding is that they know the senate won't allow him to serve and so are instead voting to keep the seat red, and are willing to accept whoever senate republicans decide to put in the seat (probably just keep Luther Strange in it).There is also the other problem, where most of alabama had already mailed in their votes when the story broke.. So this election won't provide Alabama voters with an opportunity to speak on the matter with their votes. 
1 It isn't different to the victim. 
1 textbook case.  it's the trumpster way 
1 You're absolutely right. It could end up being a Volvo. You never know!
1 No way! I'm with you! I also hate the little brats. I say kill 'em all!
1 No! If I could I would abort all children!  Hell, I wish you could be aborted!
1 Then the question becomes, "Why is it even close?"
1 That's my point.  None of this is acceptable.  None of them should be in Senate.  Roy Moore included.Downvote?  I guess people really want Roy Moore elected.
1 I am not saying the allegations are untrue. I just find it odd that they said nothing about this until this year. Which happens to be the year he runs for senate. When I question this, I am not choosing a side. I am looking at it from a neutral perspective. I see the victims side. "This guy is making a name for himself, perfect time to call him out and get justice." While I also see the opposing politicians side. "We don't like what this guy is going to do,so lets do something that will ruin him." I just don't like it when people jump on the bandwagon and hate on someone for something that isn't even proven to be true. We are supposed to live by innocent until proven guilty, but so many people are hating on this guy when there is no proof. If there was actual evidence of this man doing anything with these girls, then I could see people doing the same thing they are now. But I'm sorry, telling someone something happened is not proof. Again not saying he is innocent or these girls are lying, or vice versa. There just not enough evidence to even make assumptions yet.   
1 When I said "besides the point" I meant it as, whether he did it or not, the media is just using this as propaganda at this point. 
1 Then people should attack him for what he has already done, not something that has yet to be proven.
1 They're yelling about shit from 1975...when Hillary Clinton was still a defense attorney.  Like...there is *literally nothing* left for them to use for ammunition as the entire current republican machine erodes from the inside.
1 [Yeah.](https://youtu.be/e2f13f2awK4)
1 Link please, I want to broaden my horizons
1 [Nope.](https://youtu.be/e2f13f2awK4)
1 you should tighten up your tinfoil hatxenophobic bigot
1 logic doesnt apply to the alt right or christian conservatives.  no wonder barry goldwater hated them so much
1 He was actually polling with about a 13% tail before the allegations of pedophilia hit. Surprisingly decent for alabama
1 Yup. Make it shameful to openly support him. People will still vote for him, but you want to target those people on the fence. He will have 40% of the votes no matter what it seems. But the way the polls have been going, there is about 5-10% that's really undecided.
1 Kill those who disagree
1 Yeah, I think the other guy saw a different Clinton campaign than we did.
1 Cantaloupe shouldered?  Was that an auto correct fuck up, or is that some weird racial epithet I'm not privy to?
1 Yep and I want Jones to hold their feet to the fire on this. If you're going to elect a pedophile, by God your state is going to have to own it. I don't care if it does make GOP voters dig in more, at least the vote won't be about liberal and conservative differences. It will be about whether you're voting for a man who hurt little girls or the democrat.
1 Completely agree with this, and I've always viewed political arguments this way.  It's extremely rare that you're going to convince the person you're arguing with to abandon their position and come over to your side.  But if you acquit yourself well, the people observing the exchange may be swayed in your direction.  And that's just as worthwhile.
1 That's a good statement to try out. *"Who do we believe, a republican or law enforcement?"*
1 > I started pointing out that former LAW ENFORCEMENT officers claim they were told to keep Moore away from young girls at certain events.But it was a different time! People from that era were totally okay with this behavior!  That's why so many people were skeeved out, actively hiding it from the public, or taking deliberate actions to stop him. 
1 I can hear my father saying, “well just because he was kinda creepy doesn’t mean he’s a molester! Things were different back then!” It’s hopeless, there’s no argument that can win against the brainwashing that is Fox News and Trumpism. 
1 Fake news. Paid Soros shills. <insert whatever nonsense you want here>.
1 It wont matter. They'll believe you heard it from a news channel like CNN or MSNBC... which means it's completely made up.If a document appears that has this on record then it will be fabricated just like the School Yearbook was forged by Democrats.etc. etc. etc. It won't matter
1 Better than what I've been dealing with. It quickly went from "Why were they quiet so long, and only bring it up now" to "Well he has redeemed himself by how he has lived his life since".     Quickly followed by an assertion that "had it been my daughter he would not have seen another sunrise".    Goddamn mental gymnastics needed to make these arguments are mind boggling. How the hell do you speak reason to that?
1 Source?
1 They won't believe YOU that the cops really said that, or will believe they're not 'real' cops.
1 And I could say Obama grabbed my dick when I met him. Does that suddenly make it true? People seem to be so quick to forget that people lie. You think I couldnt pull 20 witnesses to back up my claim? It would easy, because it pushes an agenda certain people can get behind. Liars dont exist as long as we like the lies.
1 Like being banned from the mall and ymca where the mall owner said he wasnt banned from the mall and saw him regularly at the ymca.......
1 Same with Biden. Face it the government is full of sexual predators and people only care if it is the opposition being targeted. Nothing will change if it didn’t when Clinton was front and center for the world to watch. 
1 I leave for basic training in January. I was kicked out of my grandmother's place, so now I live with my mother's parents, who are extremely religious, extremely pro-Trump and anti-anything-else. I have to act like I agree with everything they say, I have nowhere else to go right now. But after training, I'm not coming back.
1 I agree. If at all possible you should cut ties with anyone that acts in such a way.   One of the many lessons I’ve learned growing up is to not relay on family and to never be afraid to cut certain family members out.   For years my father would pressure me and guilt me into showing support to family members that drove drunk and killed people, Had affairs and made scandals at the very school I went too, and wife beaters. Don’t ever succumb to the pressure of society to support family no matter what.   Do what’s best for you. 
1 You refuse to talk to your family because you don't agree with their politics. That's so fucking petty.
1 Of course. All proof was fabricated by the gay liberals to try to get rid of Trump before he drains the swamp.
1 MSM is under the pay of one Mr. George Soros, of course. Don't be stupid.
1 The crazy part is that their one news source *makes shit up all the time*! It's all fucked.
1 Anyone who wasn't handpicked by Trump is, yes.
1 Of course. If any media outlet reports it other than Fox News, it’s fake. 
1 Exactly. How can you get *so* brainwashed?
1 I mean who hasn't interrupted a high school trig class to pick up some chicks? Edit: I feel dirty just writing that.
1 Thinking about what thise women have gone through makes me want to cry. Not only were they assaulted, but when they spoke out about it they have vast swathes of the population calling them liars. I think its a more extreme example of the things victins have to deal with
1 >He’s throwing shade on the male led Republican Party for their current round of general incompetence.So all men should suffer the consequences then? See how this works?
1 It doesn't matter. The fake yearbook seals the deal for me.They're doing this to get a democrat in office in Alabama, which is a long shot just by that sentence. But the people of Alabama know what's going on and they aren't about to let this shit happen. Roy Moore is going to revitalize the state, and serve the country well. It's just the "resistance" scared of making the country great again grasping at straws to do whatever they can to impede progress in the community. Alabama is a strong state, they aren't going to fall for shit like this.
1 > Sharia LawIf anything the people of Alabama will try to claim an infringement on their patent.
1 > the imagined threat of Sharia Law.Keep in mind, these are also the same people that want all laws based off the bible as well.
1 Careful, every time I say that like half a dozen people come out of the woodwork to tell me how bad Islam is, totally missing the point.It's fun, but annoying.
1 And complain that Muhammad was a pedophile.
1 Don't forget the imagined menace of transgenders in our daughters' bathrooms. That's worth worrying about, but not Roy Moore?
1 Shakira Law, dem hips don't lie, ya'll.
1 and they blame "black culture" for economic disparity. 
1 That's because they've got no problem with living in a theocracy, they just insist that it be *their*religious law that governs society.
1 They are indeed the American Taliban 
1 They are afraid Muslims will do it because it's exactly what they want.
1 >  imagined threat of Sharia Law"Sharia Law" = brown people to Alabamaniacs.
1 Thank you for this. It drives me crazy to no end that so many people are horrified at the thought of 'sharia law' when religious wackos are already hijacking our legal and political system. 
1 That's why Sharia Law seems like such a plausible threat to them. They know they'd do the same damn thing given the chance. 
1 they hate competition
1 Exactly what I was thinking. They're exactly the same and they act like they aren't afraid of muslims because most of them are brown. 
1 All while imagining just how great it would be to live in the Christian version of Iran.
1 > These are the same people who handwave and clutch their pearls at the imagined threat of Sharia Law.Speaking of Sharia Law, Roy Moore thought there was Sharia Law in parts of Chicago and Indiana. Probably heard it in a chain email and didn't bother to verify.

1 > the imagined threat of Sharia LawWell of course the closest competition is always seen as the biggest threat, like Scientology's view toward psychiatry (the competition for damaged psyches).
1 While doing all they can to usher in their own wonder bread version of it.
1 Something's tells me if sharia law comes along they won't notice any difference.......
1 Shakira Law**
1 > clutch their pearlsDo they wear pearls? what would rednecks clutch anyway?
1 Y'all Qaeda 
1 > imagined threat of Sharia Law.I believe the term they (Alabamans) use is 'Muslamic law'.
1 How many Alabamans have pearls?
1 Yes, there are literally zero people who are critical of both.It's just not possible to find fault with Christian *and* Muslim fundamentalists!
1 stop being xenophobic bigots
1 To be fair there was some extreme leftist "feminist" woman who was trying to convince American woman that Sharia Law was good and beneficial towards women. She wouldn't say they couldn't drive but she would say that loans wouldn't have interest. I'll edit my post once I find it.  She had a decent sized following. 
1 *Something something* Mary, *Something something* Joseph
1 That is absolutely fucking sick. Those parents should be locked up. I can't believe there was *one* instance of this in the US since 2000. I can't believe that's fucking *legal* anywhere in this country. OMFG, it's so much worse.>The youngest children to marry were three 10-year-old girls in Tennessee in 2001, who were married to men ages 24, 25 and 31, according to state data. 
1 Guessing she was impregnated by her rapist and the marriage happened to keep things quiet and "legit" in the eyes of fucked-up fundies. That's the context behind for many teenage brides (including those who marry boys of the same age) in religious communities.
1 > for example, air pollution wasn't part of conservative pride until the american left started driving priuses. but now they are for air pollution.For those here who don't realize it, [this is actually, literally the case amongst a number of people in the US, and is referred to as "rolling coal."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal)  It isn't even a matter of air pollution as a consequence of, say, industry or better performance, it is air pollution for the sake of air pollution.
1 > the more liberal america hates something, the more the right seems to embrace it.I really hate voting for democrats. Grrr, voting for democrats is the worst...Is it working?
1 Is it time yet for liberals to start their awareness campaign on how awesome oxygen is, and how much everyone should make sure to continuously breathe each and every day and night? 
1 The Democrats needs to start a massive campaign against suicide. 
1 we should start denying global warming is real and start supporting the KKK then. Wait.... didn't South Park already do something like this?
1 Rolling coal. Ugh.
1 So the right is just straight up evil? They choose the worst things just for the sake of being the bad guy? I mean, I always assumed they were just morally bankrupt and stupid, but them actively trying to ruin the world seems more likely. 
1 > likewise if "being against pedophilia" somehow becomes a liberal position, which weirdly seems to be becoming the case, then the right will take the opposite view in reaction.Wasn't it always understood by everyone that diddling kids was wrong? I mean, you didn't have to come out against it because it's fundamental! Somehow it became an issue like Global Warming where there are two positions, despite the one being batshit insane.
1 Enter "rolling coal"
1 I think it's more that they value actions more than words or thought.You notice how conservative protesters are basically baiting offended liberals into violent confrontations so they can say, "see? Look how peaceful and caring the left is!" But I think that's the only way people like that will receive a message.
1 That's because they think that Liberals love nature to stick it to the Republicans trying to make money.It's very odd, but they are like drone bees around their Talk Radio queen.
1 I've said it before,If President Obama came out in favor of breathing, you would have seen some republicans/right wingers jumping up and down claiming he was lying and that breathing was bad for you, then they would hold their breath until they passed out. 
1 boy do i hate free health care and education!!
1 Hmmmm you right. 
1 >the more the right seems to embrace it.  This is something I never want to have to explain to a very well-read and very liberal friend of mine simply because he may not be able to accept the fact that he had a hand in Trump winning simply by being the east-coast liberal cliche middle American conservatives villainize. 
1 I feel you, but this downplays how money in politics  is influencing a lot of these positions. 
1 Agreed, but I need to protest the Prius claim. Mainstream liberals have been against pollution since the late 60s at least. Jimmy Carter asked Americans to cut back and the conservative reaction was quite negative, to say the least. The first thing Reagan did when he took office was remove the solar panels that Carter had put on the white house. Talk about sending a message.Here's one [source](http://forgottenhistoryblog.com/the-white-house-sported-solar-panels-until-reagan-removed-them-in-1986/) (admittedly not the best).
1 "Everyday on the news, liberal pundits and politicians portray the wealthy as greedy, while conservative pundits and politicians portray the poor as lazy. Democrats have become so good at denouncing greed, Republicans now defend it. And Republicans are so good at condemning laziness, Democrats are now denying it even exists. It's a never ending dance that gets more contorted by the day."
1 It varies by state. I believe most states require parent's permission to be married below a certain age (like 17 or 18). 
1 I'll just leave this right here.https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/20/afghanistan-has-tougher-law-child-marriage-floridaAlso, Just so you know it's not only fucked up in the southhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/20/us-new-york-governor-signs-anti-child-marriage-law
1 Because if a 16 year old gets pregnant they want the child to be able to be raised by two parents.   That is the simple reason
1 From what I've seen a good chunk of those are 18 year olds marrying their 17 year old SO.  High school sweethearts last forever right? New recruits for the military often get married as it gives them better pay and housing.  While statistically not great for a long term marriage, it's not so bad. I'm willing to bet the next  is underage pregnant teens "made honest". Kids who didn't get a sex education and get an "oops baby." Story time: We have a lot of family down south and they had a poor girl at their church get pregnant at 15 because the only sex ed she got was "When God thinks you are ready he'll give you a baby." Wasn't told about sex at all let alone were babies come from. She ended up married to her 18 year old bf. I know the plural of data isn't anecdote but might be helpful. 
1 Religion. And pregnancy. So basically... shitty parenting. 
1 Ask Ted Nugent!
1 Most of the spouses are also children. Puberty happens regardless of what a government decides is the age of consent. For the ones that aren't, I dunno. Probably?
1 Some backward rural parts of the country still do "shotgun marriages", it's mostly teen boys being made to marry the girl they knocked up.
1 Does it really matter if it's a little bit more/less worse? Biggest TIL today is how much TX likes to rob the cradle.
1 /r/theydidthemath
1 But as a percentage of total marriages, Idaho is the worst offender with 89 child marriages per 10,000
1 I believe so. It is voidable though.
1 [yup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_marriage_in_the_United_States)
1 Kids marry kids a lot in the South. I graduated with 5 boys & girls who were married to someone else under the age of 18.  There were a few more engaged or married to someone over 18, but under 21. They all identified as Christians. 
1 I'm guessing it's mostly teens marrying other teens. Some of the more backward rural areas still have "shotgun marriages", so-called because of the stereotype of the dad going to the boy who got his daughter pregnant and telling him that he's going to marry her.
1 Frankly I think anyone under 21 shouldn't be allowed to get married. Marriage is absolutely insane in general, but at the very least you should be 21 before you decide to sign a literal lifelong contract, one that if you break it, you can fuck up your life for a long, long time. 
1 Projection, projection, projection...
1 They then made him a circuit judge, the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court,  watched him get kicked off the bench for being a theocratic asshat, *voted him in as the Chief Justice again*, watched him get removed a second time for being a theocratic asshat, and now he's running for the Senate. I mean, damn, are they really that worried about it? Cause it doesn't seem like anything else he's ever done wrong has cost him, and he's still right in the thick of the polling. All I've seen proof of is that whoever owned that mall had a better head on their shoulders than about half of the Alabama electorate. 
1 Because he wasn't marrying them.
1 [Also, Doug Jones prosecuted people who bombed a church.](https://imgur.com/pJf8Urw)*Please spread this and [other](https://imgur.com/a/CPjbl) images about the election everywhere. It's one week away, so it's crunch time. Voter turnout will be very important.*
1 at least part of that i'm sure is the mall not wanting to get the shit sued out of them
1 Was that ever proven? I'm not pro-Moore by any means but I thought it was just what his alleged victim said.Downvoted for asking a legit question? Lol
1 With a parent's permission, yeah, you can get married as young as 16. Not sure how they're getting 13 year old's married though, from what I can find even in Alabama that's not legal.
1 Most states allow marriages under 18 with parental consent, and maybe having to appear before a judge or see a pre-marriage counselor for approval.  California’s pretty liberal and actually has no minimum age on the books - age of consent is 18, anything younger requires both parental consent and a court order.  In practice that doesn’t happen especially often over here, but it’s allowed.  Alabama I believe allows marriage at 14 with parental consent.   So I guess more parents are giving that consent in AL than basically anywhere else?
1 In the sense that it's a petri dish, sure.
1 Actually from a scientific and medical perspective child marriage actually means weaker children. From an economic perspective? It's encouraging poverty. It's not pragmatic. It's scientifically proven to be awful. 
1 It doesn't ignore their happiness, it ignores their *humanity*.
1 I was thinking, oh it’s gonna be some shitting southern state, annnnnd it’s my home state.God fucking dammit Texas
1 Fuck you, I'm worth something.
1 Half the population of what? Not Alabama or Texas...
1 well he did inspire the ACA which is the worst thing that has ever happened to this country... so can you really blame them?yes, you can
1 Because they've abandoned the idea of fixed positions entirely.As far as the American right is concerned, to have a stable position at all is leftist. If you aren't aggressively trying to drag the Overton Window further right *regardless* of where it is at the moment, you're basically a communist. It's a battle to prove that you're "more right wing", not an attempt to find any kind of logical defensible stance on an issue.
1 Romney was always seen as a moderate RINO from his days as Governor of Massachusetts, even in 2012. 
1 If only Roy Moore was exposed for having a consensual relationship with a black woman, instead of raping multiple young girls, then maybe the people of Alabama would stop supporting him.
1 I mean, to be fair, anything not overtly racist *is* out of the mainstream in *Alabama.*
1 Why is everyone making this into an Alabama thing?This is the republican party. Moore was endorsed by Donald trump. It's a waste of a scandal to frame this as about Alabama. _Any state_ with enough republicans in it would vote for Moore. 
1 "I know you're in Tuscaloosa but we had to change your precinct to Birmingham. Roll Tide!"
1 hopefully there will be as many Poll drive vans as possible carrying people to the proper places and picking them up afterwards.  transportation is a big issue in these kinds of elections, especially where the poor and disadvantaged are concerned. if the polls aren't within 1 or 2 miles of where they live, they're not going to vote unless they own a car or can drive. 
1 OK. PEOPLE!Alabama needs Pedobear costumes STAT.Trolling the poll watchers on YouTube is probably the only laugh we'll get out of this.Internet ... you know what to do. Make it so!
1 Why dont you come down and poll watch then?
1 Consider making a donation to the jones campaign, so they can fund an effective gotv effort. Every little bit helps.
1 > cynical of the Dems chancesThere are no Dems chances.This is Alabama.The fact that the republican may or may not be a child rapist is nowhere near as important as the fact that he is definitely not a democrat.
1 I also figure you have to bump Moore's numbers up because of people that are embarrassed to admit to a poller that they're going to vote for Moore. 
1 But people going to polling places and open carrying is cool. 
1 [You're goddamn right](https://media.giphy.com/media/U1XhGr8CWqvVC/giphy.gif)
1 Is it fun to argue against statements that were never made?
1 I didn’t yell anything and yeah the yearbook is totally true and real... lul. It’s 2017 and it’s the liberals that want to bring back lynchings based on gut feelings.
1 Could someone link to a list of Republicans who aren’t sociopaths? 
1 That's what so amazing about this. McConnell and the other sociopaths spent decades working on gerrymandering and voter suppression to stay in power, and once they finally get it done the people who benefit are a racist orange conman and a serial rapist. 
1 > I might feel bad for McConnell if he wasn't a ~~sociopath~~ spineless turkeyftfy 
1 There is no possible way to feel bad for McConnell. 
1 Can anthropomorphic tortoises be sociopathic? I'm willing to say yes.
1 See I read that as hes going to let the people decide who to send since they can't get him to quit the race, but once he gets up there if the allegations turn true they'll still bounce his ass right back to Greenbo AlaBAMA
1 No, see, it's not taking place in Germany in the early thirties and no-one has a toothbrush mustache, so there is literally nothing to compare it to in history!
1 It’s not being ignored. It’s being used as a playbook by the right. 
1 Those who learn about history are doomed to watch those who don’t repeat it...
1 I was thinking bear traps. but money works too. 
1 I just hope being "he who controls the wifi" will give me enough of an edge.
1 Age and experience trumps Youth and vigor.
1 My parents gave me a good allowance. They used this to control me. Don't take out the trash, -$1. Don't keep your room clean -$2.... and so forth. 
1 "You just whip out the baby pics.  Here's little Donny getting washed in the sink...  So cute."  "Dad!"  "Here's little Eric getting washed in the sink by his older brother."  "Dad!"
1 Honestly the best strategy is to find an anti-aging clinic NOW and just get loaded on test so you'll have the upper hand when they get older. I recommend a 495 deadlift, 405 squat, and 315 bench minimum (raw, paused)
1 I always told my kids, "when the time comes and I can't kick your ass, I will hire somebody who can" :D
1 That's one fucked up way of parenting.
1 Don't forget that you are legally obligated to do that.  It is your duty as a parent to provide shelter.  Holding the act of putting a roof over their head over their head, IMO, abuses your power as a parent and does nothing but teach a child to wield power recklessly.   
1 >...make sure they don't thrive by the time they're old enough to understandUm..yeah..that's kind of optimistic.  If conservatives are going to behave the way I think they are going to behave in the future, your child and their lil friends my want to practice saying "I offer myself for tribute to the Senate!!"
1 Hahahah!  Though I constantly tell our youngest (8) to put the fat black ball of hate and claws down, she'll still come to me with claw marks to show off that she did not, in fact, listen.  I tell her stupid should hurt.  I also tell her how to clean cat scratches to avoid infection, because though stupid should hurt, it shouldn't cause sepsis.
1 "Mom! The testicle won't stay on his side of the car!"
1 very nice, I like. 
1 [It's not just empathy.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/liberals-care-more-about-empathy-than-conservatives/380404/) Conservatives also value curiosity, tolerance, and creativity lower than liberals when it comes to what they consider important for their children. But they do score higher on religious faith and obedience!Basically their values are completely inverted of what is needed to create psychologically and emotionally healthy people. Other than extreme left-wing economics like unreconstructed Marxism (which no elected official supports currently) you could not come up with a more reliable way to produce inter-generational human misery than social conservatism--which literally hundreds of Republicans support on the Federal level, thousands if you count state and local governments.
1 We are all guilty of that...the difference is being able to think critically about things. My mind can and has been  changed with intelligent discourse. I wish others could be like this on BOTH sides of the political spectrum.
1 “Everyone must like what I like, believe what I believe, hate what I hate, and act like I act.”Instead of treating others the way they’d like to be treated they’re treating themselves the way they’d like others to be treated.
1 No, they understand if, it just scares them.
1 Republicans always, _always_ support republicans. It's one of their defining features. 
1 Shame is definitely an alien concept to Trump and McConnell, so it rubs off on everyone else. You know, like a pervert in the mall...
1 And adolescent children.
1 There was an Alabaman man who said even if his teenage daughter accused Roy Moore, he would still vote for him.Maybe Doug Jones is too good for Alabama.
1 It's okay.  My wife is from New Jersey.
1 > But the GOP vote like a motherfucker. It's like a zombie swarm every electionIts the churches.  The majority of people in the south goes to church, and the church leaders pressure their people to vote.  They make it a social event, and shame people who don't.  They preach about how good the Republican candidate is, and make snide remarks about the Democratic one (usually not explicitly saying "the Democrat" or naming them, but everyone knows what they are talking about).
1 This would be the first major election since the governor giving felons their voting rights back. There could be just enough of a splinter in the GOP voting. Could be interesting.
1 Good to know. Not sure a sign would help in Kansas City but thanks.
1 I can't really blame them.  If there are places where pedophiles can win because they have an R next to their name and not a D...you may want to spend your resources elsewhere.  I like the concept of a 50 state strategy, but you don't have unlimited cash and some places are going to be a lost cause because the people who live there are just that brainwashed.

1 >Plant some treesDon't you guys poison those?
1 Just tell a deranged person who lives closer to Tuscaloosa than Auburn that Cam Newton has planted trees all over Alabama, and they are definitely gonna roll them on January 26th. 
1 Valar Dohaeris.
1 Petyr Baelish
1 Yeah. Everyone needs to prepare themselves for a Jones loss. In a better world this wouldn't be an issue, but thanks to President Pussy-grabber and the Alabama GOP we may be getting a senator that is a child predator

1 No problem, you're technically correct as he caught their murderers, I just found the wording to be rather funny. It made me genuinely laugh, so thank you for making my day a little better. 
1 Because there are folks that seriously have this as a viewpoint. Strange times bud, strange times
1 I'm not sure what this is pointing out, but here's what I found interesting> Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.Assuming the analogy is perfect, #8 kinda implies that those claiming "deep-state!" (those in support of our current administration) are actually on the side of the Fascist government, condemned to lose.
1 Because some of the more recent accusations are still in the statute of limitations. Those are what Cosby went to court for.Google is your friend, and research will help you to look less stupid!
1 Lol. Not only stupid, but stupid so you can in defend a child predator. Nice! How's pizzagate going btw? 
1 Actually the statue of limitation did exist when he committed these crimes and has since ran out. Also, these people have already received death threats and had people stalk them w/of the court case and are probably afraid to continue, even if they could. Right wing nuts are treating their lives and they would rather keep living then press charges.
1 If any of those accusations fell within the statute of limitations, i promise you there would be charges. This is exactly the risk the GOP needs to avoid. If they start to think their voting base is supporting a child molester, they will be replaced by the freedom caucus before the next presidential election cycle. 
1 Yes, and another way to look at is voting for a child molester. 
1 Is there proof that he was banned?
1 You are really making some assumptions about my political beliefs. 
1 Trump has 16.
1 Not as bad as I feel about Moore but not great. 
1 Innocent until proven guilty amirite?
1 Frankenstein has a fucking picture of him doing it. Lol not even the same thing.
1 I'll skip the 'how can you support trump' stuff. I'm glad you accept that there is strong evidence against Moore
1 How is his view fucked up? 
1 > It sucks because Jones's view on abortion is extremely ~~fucked up~~ mainstream and in line with what the majority of Americans believe.FTFY.
1 how the fuck is it a certainty? because of allegations? where were these allegations before? and why the fuck did the only come to light *during an election*? i mean, really? you actually buy that? the timing of everything, and how it has all been portrayed, leads me (and others) to believe that it is entirely politically-motivated theater designed to try and keep one man from being elected. and it won't work.
1 The things you write give an insight into a very twisted reality. You terrify me. 
1 wow dude, with spin that strong, you could be classified as a cat 5 hurricane.    EDIT:  Hurricanes have Categories, not Classes.
1 So any accusation of a liberal is true and any accusation of a conservative is made up.  Have I got the gist of it?
1 Lol you stupid fucks actually think the FBI cares about what reporters say.  What world do you live in?  That's like some 5 year olds view of the world
1 It’s not about crimes. If this was about crimes you would be just as upset with Trump. He’s killing children in Yemen right now. 
1 The accounts of dozens of people is certainly more than a shred of evidence. Perhaps not of non-statutory rape, but certainly of inappropriately trying to mack on young girls.  That's creepy enough for me. 
1 When you have several dozen people all saying he was observed to regularly mack on inappropriately young girls, yeah, there's proof for at least that.Maybe you're fine with the idea of a Senator who's only *accused* of rape and maybe is just *really, really* creepy.  I'm not.
1 Yes. There are like 50 different pieces of proof out there. 
1 Beyond ALL of the people saying he did this shit, and that he was creep, banned from the mall, known to date teens, notes in teen girls year books,  and of course himself - admitting that he dated teenagers, and met his wife when he was a teenager? Beyond all fo that?  No. There's no proof. 
1 Alabama police were directed to make sure he stayed away from high school cheerleaders and he was banned from a mall for stalking underage women. He was also in a relationship with a 14 year old when he was 32. Those are all verified facts, not allegations.
1 lol you are a garbage human being. 50 fucking people came forward and accused him or backed up an accuser. Sworn police statements, your boy is a child predator, and you are defending him. Bet you wouldn't say this shit at your place of employment, that is if you work at all lol.
1 Just to clarify, all the women who have accused Roy Moore of chasing after and/or molesting them as teenagers, as well as all the people who support their stories, such as the people who verified Moore's predation at the shopping mall, as well as Moore himself, who was first attracted to his now wife when she was 15...all of them are lying?
1 Where "he" is Donald Trump, for whom Epstein had something like 15 different phone numbers and a close relationship. 
1 You mean Epstein? Who Donald Trump hung out with for years as well? The guy that one of Donald Trumps rape accusers said set her up with Trump when she was 13? That guy? Fucking bs double standard 
1 That was actually Trump, the guy that was going to be a character witness for Jerry Epstien and consistently flew private flights with the men to child sex hotspots. 
1 So was Donald Trump.  
1 Roy Moore's victims had no choice but to let him do what he wanted. They were alone with him in a secluded place and he was twice their age. That's why statutory rape laws exist; children lack the mental faculties to consent under ordinary circumstances and when propositioned by an adult in the way Roy Moore did it they are put under duress.That's just reality. I invite you to stop defending a child molester and join me in it. 
1 The article is literally about the quote, so I don't know how it's clickbait. If you don't like what Jones said you could just complain about that, but you have nothing to complain about the title. 
1 Alabama Republicans aren't reading WaPo anyway. They're probably not reading at all. But Alex Jones will report on it, and they love him.Still, there's very little that could possibly come out that would make Doug Jones worse than a child molester. 
1 Or the fact they have had their lives threatened by white Wong nut jobs and are being stalked on the streets, that's more then likey the reason they don't want to go forward and didn't want to back then. 
1 Or that pesky statute of limitations.  
1 The storied would easily hold up in court.  The problem is that the statute of limitations ran out years ago.  There could be photographic evidence of it and he still couldn't be tried.
1 They aren’t the same thing. You want to put women in jail
1 And what of some of us genially don’t feel guilty but relieved?
1 Then why did you call them two different things if they are the same thing? 
1 > You do know that a fetus and a baby ARE the same thing, right?surely you can back up this wild claim with some peer reviewed sources, right?
1 The first logical fallacy that anti-choice folks have is that all life is precious. Fact of the matter is no life is precious, all life everywhere is fucking chaos.Chaos doesn't give a fuck about you, I or unborn higher primates. Chaos doesn't see any life as precious but only as fuel for more chaos. Stop pretending the anti-choice movement is anything but class warfare guised by religious and fear-mongering zealotry.
1 I had a guy I work with try to throw Pizzagate out there the other day. I literally just laughed out loud and said I was done. I can't argue with someone who truly believes that shit.
1 That's nice, but doesn't change the fact that only a piece of shit would put a child molester in the US Senate. 
1 When you have to decide against kiddie diddling and abortion and you pick kiddie diddlingYou'll burn in hell for supporting a pedo 
1 He's got a hard-on crime all right.
1 >  Or do you honestly believe clear fake news allegations? why exactly was Moore banned from that mall again? 
1 Woosh
1 ooh that incivility 
1 It was a drunken accident forty years ago. It's about as relevant as Laura Bush.
1 Ted Kennedy is dead, for one.
1 Let's just hope all your boys keep lying to the FBI.Fun Fact:  When the FBI asks you a question, they typically already know the answer.  They're watching you as you answer.  Body language, word choice, etc.I cannot wait until Trump is questioned.

1 This passes as a counter-argument? 
1 Um, slavery has been very specifically ILLEGAL in this country for quite some time.
1 So based on your opinion of what does and doesn’t constitute life, you then write a sarcastic comment based on your opinion of liberals as a group.None of the last few comments I have read belonging to you have any fact in them whatsoever.
1 But then how would Roy Moore molest them??? 
1 Because Alabama just sucks I guess. 
1 > We are supposed to live by innocent until proven guilty, but so many people are hating on this guy when there is no proof. If there was actual evidence of this man doing anything with these girls, then I could see people doing the same thing they are now. But I'm sorry, telling someone something happened is not proof.You would be correct if this was a criminal case. It is not. Social consequences do not require guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and people aren't innocent until proven guilty, mostly because it's impossible to prove guilt outside a courtroom. Everyone knows this, and it's why, "prove the allegations" is such a cop out. Even the top Republicans in Congress have called for Moore to step down, so I don't see how you could consider this a political issue. The only people playing politics are those who choose to ignore valid allegations just so their party can win. 
1 Investigations from credible news outlets such as the Washington Post are not propaganda. 
1 Porque no los dos?
1 You do realize she's laughing about polygraphs right? The only scandal would be if she didn't do the job to the best of her ability and falsely represented a client.
1 Question, she doesn't appear to be laughing about getting a child rapist off, why lie about that? Before you embarrass yourself in the future, you might wanna consider checking Snopes or the like. You'll really look a lot more intelligent if you aren't walking around saying such stupid things.In addition, why would anyone hold a lawyer defending someone against them?

1 Moore has serious  baggage beyond just this scandal. The guy is extreme. 
1 Rumor is - *something* - 13 tail - *something* - Roy Moore hit on it.
1 That would be both massively economically disruptive, traumatizing to participants, and would remove any possibility of reform and reconciliation in the decades to come.Please don’t equate social pressure with physical violence.

1 Oh, god, they are both right all the time! What do we DO?! PANIC PANIC.Or, you know, the dozen other people from an array of political backgrounds who confirmed this. But they are just women. Not even women representing The Party. Why would we listen to them?
1 Maybe try a multiple choice question:"It's 10 o'clock at night and you just learned your 14-year-old daughter is about to meet a 33 year old man she's been texting. What do you do:a) Grab your shotgun and hold him for the police?  b) Elect him to the Senate?
1 They will say that the law enforcement officer must be a liberal to say such a thing!
1 >"Who do we believe, a ~~republican~~**politician** or law enforcement?"That will circumvent some of their defensiveness.
1 It is only a good statement if they don't suffer from overwhelming levels of cognitive dissonance.Unfortunately, if they're at the point where they don't believe there at least a good chance Moore is a predator, it's almost certain they can hold multiple diametrically opposed beliefs concurrently. 
1 Law enforcement was just following the corrupt orders given by secret deep state liberals who were trying to ruin a good man.
1 Lol small town Alabama cops in the 70's are almost definitely republican/conservatives. 
1 Doesn't matter when a Democrat will do far more damage to the country /s
1 With all the cops lying about shooting people, and that fbi guy gettin kicked off the investigation...maybe your dichotomy isn’t the best. Just saying. 
1 I presume by "basic training" you mean the army? If I may ask, why did you decide to join the army?
1 I'm sorry you've been thrust into a desperate situation. Good luck with basic training, I just separated and my brother just graduated basic training for the Air Force. Being a liberal in the military can be tough sometimes too, but the majority of enlisted folk look out for their brothers. 
1 Good for you!  I’d happily let someone like you crash on my couch.I live a few minutes from the Georgia border and an hour from Alabama.  There are some seriously racist stupid assholes.When I drive around I just bite my tongue and walk away.  It’s just not worth it dealing with some of them.
1 Sounds like a job for r/raisedByNarcissists
1 Their politics are just a symptom of the real issue which is their immorality and toxicity. I refuse to talk to them because they are terrible people.
1 I've shown my family news articles from entirely different countries that points out how much of a baffoon Trump is; they think it's fake news.
1 It's not even that. If it's news *they don't like*, it's fake. They genuinely live in a different reality.
1 Even though I don’t know you, I know that you are, at the very least, a decent normal human being because of the edit
1 > The fake yearbook seals the deal for me.Wow.
1 I believe they've already done so against Margaret Atwood.
1 Middle Eastern religions are evil except when they're the one true word of God. Then we need an unconstitutional monument to that middle eastern religion in our courthouse and we need to elect the man that refused to remove it to the US Senate.

1 Yeah, that's the joke.

1 Got called a “Sand ni$&er” and “Taqiya” the other day for trying to correct someones views on Islam.Little do they know I’m white as cream cheese and radically agnostic.
1 That’s an attempt to change the subject. Don’t fall for it. 
1 Man, whenever I get depressed by the Moore supporters on the news pages on FB, I come back over here and feel so much better. I don’t know why I’m replying to you except that you made me laugh. 
1 dude but "insert random historical event", seeeee mussslimss are evil
1 All religion is bad. Sharia law is very bad. 
1 At the same time, Mary was 14 so it's okay for us.
1 Which isn't even true. 
1 *They can't rape our adolescent daughters if we've already sold them off for tax cuts!*
1 Just so you know, it's polite to say transgendered people - "transgenders" is not currently considered polite nomenclature.
1 Roy Moore and his ilk will happily guard the girls' bathroom at the middle school dance. To protect them from transgenders of course.
1 The alt-right betrays itself. It doesn't want transgendered safe bathrooms because what if they go in to grab some little girl by the pussy and find a penis?    If Roy Moore wanted to feel up on penis, that's what the men's restroom is for!
1 The problem with the transgender rule is that it will allow people like Moore to enter little girls bathrooms freely. 
1 I don't think "transgendered" men going into bathrooms and molesting girls is all that outlandish and I think it's already happened. I used quotations because he wasn't a true transgendered man he was just some creep saying that so he could molest little girls, but it will definitely happenThe real reason I replied is because you are completely right that if they are so worried about this happening why do they elect an official who essentially did the same thing. Anytime someone says they don't support transgender bathrooms I will ask how they feel about Roy Moore. 
1 I, for one, welcome a new era of Shakira Law

1 Was she about to become a US Senator with the full support of a national party? If not, then it's not fair to equivocate.
1 If it's okay for a infinity-old sky being to impregnate a 13-year-old, then what's really the harm in a 74 year old doing so?As the whole western world gets ready to celebrate the product of the god-rape of a child, I can't wait for these patriarchal death cults to fall into the trash bin of history. 
1 Holy fucking shit what is wrong with these people

1 my claim is not that they are evil - it's that they have an inflamed sense of tribalism which is precipitating irrational behavior.
1 No, of course not. The ancient Greeks loved fucking kids. 
1 Jesus Christ.I just looked into it briefly and yeah you're right Alabama is 16+ (Requires parental consent) but it also states that if parental consent isn't given, it is NOT grounds for an annulment. Wtf?Hawaii also 15+ age of marriage.
1 What's the deal with parental permission to get married when you're 13? Like does parental permission somehow make that ok?
1 >tory time: We have a lot of family down south and they had a poor girl at their church get pregnant at 15 because the only sex ed she got was "When God thinks you are ready he'll give you a baby." Wasn't told about sex at all let alone were babies come from. She ended up married to her 18 year old bf. I find it very hard to believe that someone wouldn't know where babies come from. This is the kind of thing that kids talk about way before it's taught in school. 
1 > I know the plural of data isn't anecdote but might be helpfulThough I gather that you understand the point of it, you have that statement backwards. Multiple anecdotes do not constitute (quality) data.
1 Data is actually the plural form of datum. Yes I am a lot of fun at parties. 
1 That's *literally* their M.O. Votes against gays? Gets caught fucking men. Hates pedophilia? Caught sexually molesting children. Hates a different religion? The most fundie bastard you'll come across. Pro-Life? Probably paid to have at least one abortion by one of their mistresses.
1 Moore was defeated twice in runs for governor.  He has been elected in the past thanks to other more moderate candidates knocking each other out and Moore ending up in the runoff where he wins because the only people that vote in runoffs are the hard core evangelicals.  You keep saying "they" when there is more than a large percentage of Alabamians that do not support him or like him. 
1 Why ~~marry~~buy the calf when you can get the veal for free?
1 Well how was he supposed to marry them without courting them first?! /s if it’s even needed
1 Hey, I was just thinking of a slogan:People that commit sexual crimes should not be in politics.  Time to sayNo MooreIf you want to use it for a poster, that'd be cool
1 This is great, just a small suggestion......Make Doug Jones and Roy Moore and what they ave done different colors. it all kinda blends together too much. 
1 A number of folks who were cops/security guards at the time have said that they were told to keep an eye on him. Since he was a powerful judge, and would threaten to ruin lives of his victims/anyone who stopped him, they couldn't officially ban/arrest him.One guy I remember was instructed to "keep Moore away from high school cheerleaders."
1 How does that work, you can get married at 14 but the age of sexual consent is presumably 18 (I don't live in the usa). If you can't consent at 14 then how can you get married
1 > and maybe having to appear before a judgeImagine that judge being Roy Moore.*"so how old are you Diana?"**"I am 14, you honor"**"and are you a naughty girl, Diana?"*
1 I think he meant pragmatic for the goal of simply having as many children as possible, not having quality, healthy, economically stable children (which, to be fair, was dictated by the husbands status anyways).
1 It’s pragmatic for an era of human history when mere survival of the community meant pumping out as many births as possible as fast as possible in hopes that some of them might survive long enough to start pumping out births themselves. Modern health care and food systems may have some problems, but they do stand between humanity and animal barbarism. However, people like Roy Moore who continue to support child marriage (and many other conservative positions) obviously *prefer* to be barbarian animals.

1 "worst thing"... Lol, you need to read some history.
1 nope.  they'd twist that and call him "brave."  Southern white racists love to use public opportnities to prove they're not racist. 
1 Unlikely... "they started [to] create new rights in 1965, and today we've got a problem" - Roy Moore... 
1 You're right maybe if he married her.  If you could just raped her it would be fine.
1 Strom Thurmond still had his supporters even after the revelation about his lovechild.
1 > Why is everyone making this into an Alabama thing?Well, there is an upcoming special election in Alabama...
1 I volunteered to help drive people to the polls all day on election day, and I was told on Saturday that there's actually such a huge turnout for help getting people around that they asked if I could help in other ways, if they needed that instead. So at least in my area (Madison county) we have a good problem! And there's a big drive to train volunteers to help keep an eye on the polling stations. Whatever fuckery they get away with won't be due to lack of effort on our part, I'll tell you that. The people who are voting for Doug are just as passionate and determined as the R side!
1 Good call! Thanks for the suggestion.
1 Also, if you live in or near Alabama and have the time/money, consider signing up to canvas for Jones -- basically, knocking on doors and asking people to vote for him. Seems silly, but a lot of times that's the nudge that pushes people who are on the fence, or otherwise wouldn't have voted, over.
1 Give every minority some sticks and shovels on their way to the polls. Either open carry gets rescinded or they're allowed in. Win-win. 
1 You said "apparently this position is considered 'radically liberal' in America" about the statement "men who hurt little girls should go to jail, not the Senate". The logical meaning of your statement was that a majority of Americans believe that men who hurt little girls should not go to jail. Thus my comment.

1 Jokes.
1 For about six months my son was terribly intimidated by our large black cat; something that the cat could totally sense and would take advantage of: blocking him on the stairs, diving out from under the couch and beds to "tag" him, watching him use the potty, etc. To "get over it", my son's new chore is feeding the cat. The cat allows this tenuous truce as long as the young male child continues to fill his bowl when yowled at. 
1 Let's not pretend there isn't a much bigger problem with this on the political right. It's not that being on the political right causes these cognitive issues. It's that the worse that a person has issues with this kind of cognition, the further to the political right they go.
1 Or they think it's inherently bad to be different than themselves, "cuz they was raised right!" It goes hand in hand with authoritarianism, both political and religious. Monotheism teaches truly awful ethics.
1 That's where we are now
1 Until it doesn't matter anymore (due to the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned tax bill), if you have personal knowledge of such endorsements by churches, *please* report them to the IRS.
1 To be fair, a number of pastors have turned against Moore. 
1 My aunt's church passed out pamphlets last year basically saying voting for Hillary will send you to hell because she supports abortion. And this was in the north.
1 Guess who go to churches in droves in Alabama? If I were Doug Jones I would hit as many black churches this Sunday as possible. He isn’t going to get the white vote. White, evangelical women are polling toward Moore at +20. 
1 It sounds like the church thinks of the other party as Demoncrats. 
1 I mean tbh everyone should go out and vote, if not for the best (ina system like the American with two parties sometimes both are dubious options) at least for the not so bad option
1 It's more than that.  It's also about having time off to vote, and feeling like you have a chance.  I was a democrat for much of my youth, and being from texas I just felt like it was hopeless no matter what.  Also it's a pain in the ass when you show up at a polling booth, having registered, having your drivers license, but be told that since you moved you can't vote there.  There are a lot of artificial barriers placed to voting.
1 I was mostly kidding. We're doing our best to get the word out though.

1 Well, yeah. If voters didn't care about Trump literally admitting to sexual assault, they're not going to care about Roy Moore. 
1 I wasn't aware that there had to be a crime before someone decides whether or not they vote for someone.
1 Doing what? Having sex with children? Raping people?Or holding his hands above a woman's breasts in a stupid joke he later apologised for, an apology his 'victim' accepted?
1 You're right; in Moore's case, it's worse.  Franken has the one picture where he's making the honking gesture above a woman's breasts.  In Moore's case...* There are multiple women who've come forward describing an astonishingly familiar pattern of behavior.* Documented reports of of Moore being [banned from malls](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/locals-were-troubled-by-roy-moores-interactions-with-teen-girls-at-the-gadsden-mall) for hanging out with teenagers.* And, best of all, a high school year book signed by a 30-year-old Moore.So.
1 Well that’s just patently false. 
1 Turns out that stuff that people were just going to let fade into the past tends to seem more pressing once someone is about to become a senator. Who'da thunk it?
1 So you're just gonna ignore what I said in my comment, that apparently in your head it would be okay Roy Moore assaults children cause you don't like the left?
1 Hurricanes have categories, not classes.
1 How so?  The email thing was just one of many scandals Hillary was involved in yet the media continues to side with her.  She literally destroyed evidence in the case!  But let's look at some the media dutifully is silent about - 900 FBI files the Clintons illegally obtained, their cattle futures racket, Whitewater (including a Batman villain type Jim McDougal who died in jail (so considerate of him))....and that isn't even counting the myriad deaths including Vince Foster.  Oh, and why does Chelsea look exactly like Webb Hubble?  LOL!!!!!!!!The media hated Moore and whip up some story out of nowhere and start a whispering campaign.  
1 Roy Moore is like the old neighbourhood pedophile from Family Guy (https://i.pinimg.com/736x/28/14/22/28142293d86a90be3572d38df38155ed--family-guy-humor-creepy-guy.jpg).
1 Would it be more accurate to describe the allegations as "pedophilia"?  Since pedophilia implies underage victims, by definition it's "rape". GaslightObstructPedophilia  <\~\~\~\~ you are here
1 Does not count. Need a video of him banging a 14-year-old, he needs to be holding up his driver's license and she needs to be holding up her birth certificate. As a birth certificate is not a photo ID her parents need to be there to confirm her identity, showing their drivers licenses, of course.
1 If those are facts provide proof. Those sound like baseless accusations without proof. 
1 I heard it was both.  But sure Trump is a scumbag.  Clinton is clearly an unrepentant pussyhound who may or maynot be a scumbag too.
1 Dude, not once did I say he wasn't.. WTF man. 
1 I will gladly do so once due process is followed. 
1 My complaint is with the site that wrote the article and their choice of title (and hence the emphasis and effect on people who don't read the whole thing and outrage over what they feel the title means) and *indirectly* with whoever posted the article on here, not the content of the article.
1 I want to put doctors in jail that murder babies, yes.  I want to get women easier access to adoption facilities if they do not want to keep the child, and easier access for families to adopt.
1 You're saying Kennedy was drunk? Intoxicated while he sped off a bridge and got another person killed? And that's somehow not really, really bad? Because drunken drivers killing people left and right is just things that happen and in no way indicative of an irresponsible and weak willed person?Though it should be said, unlike you, Kennedy kept claiming he *wasn't* drunk. He was stone cold sober when he sped off a bridge, got out alive and made no attempt to save his passenger. Stone cold sober when he left her dying in the water and strolled to his hotel and went straight to bed without alerting the authorities. Stone cold sober when having a friendly chat with friends about sailing in the morning. After a lovely little breakfast, he was finally confronted about these events and still didn't contact the authorities, he got on the phone with his advisers.Kennedy in fact never reported any of these events to the authorities. Things only hit the fan when some fishermen found the body. He killed a person and didn't report it, but you don't think it smells like a cover up?Also, it turns out that Kopechne survived for three hours after the accident. If Kennedy *had* phoned the accident in, she most likely would have been saved and Kennedy wouldn't be a killer. So he didn't really kill her by driving off a bridge, he in fact killed her by trying to cover the accident up.I'm sorry, but it seems to me that when push came to shove, Ted Kennedy was fucking scum, same as Roy Moore.
1 I like to drive around and drown women when I drink. Not a big deal
1 You are fantasizing about Trump the same way kids fantasize about what will happen in the next Avengers movie. Really weird.
1 He does have a point, though. We may not recognize injustice because we universally benefit from it.
1 35% of aborted babies are black despite black people being 13% of the population.If I was a racist, then I would shout my praise of abortion from the rooftops for that reason. In fact, that's one of the main reasons Margaret Sanger (founder of Planned Parenthood) championed it. 
1 Hey, listen. I'm just saying I hate kids as much as you do. We're in the same boat here.
1 I only seen this as a political issue because he is a politician. With the way you and others have explained it to me I know only see it as the media milking the story. I still stand by the no evidence thing. I just don't see how you could believe someone did something when there is no proof of it. I guess that's just a place we are cut differently.  
1 >The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn't say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims.She was laughing **with** the victim.
1 Christian fascism isn't seen as baggage in Alabama. It's not a fault, it's a feature.
1 Calves are on your legs though
1 It's easy. Who ever has the most power is the correct one. Right now Moore has more power than those current/former cops so people can claim those cops are being paid to lied by the left wing media. 
1 Trump says the FBI is in tatters, the FBI says it has good reason to want to look into his finances. Who do they support?Exactly. 
1 No panic. Just "that's fake news."
1 Those cops are in a union, right? Problem solved.
1 > "Who do we believe, a ~~republican~~ ~~**politician**~~ ***Trump-endorsed candidate*** or law enforcement?"

1 No, police officers are above lying. Those people probably shot themselves. ^^^/s
1 Sure. Yes, it is the Army. National guard, if you want to get technical. At first, it was for college money. My family won't pay shit, and I'm just a broke 19yo. The job I got came with a hefty bonus as well. Then, when I actually started going to drills, I enjoyed it. I enjoy following orders. I enjoy all the helicopter rides and weapons simulations and IED training. I enjoy all the people I drill with. Hell, even my sergeants are fucking awesome. I just love the environment. I go once a month, for a weekend, and by the time Sunday comes, I don't want to go back home. After I graduate college, I plan on going active and travelling, doing my 20 or so years, maybe longer. It's a lot more than a job now, a lot more than the monetary reason for which I joined in the first place.
1 Thank you very much. I've found that out now, both points. The second one more, though. I look forward to see everyone when I go drilling.
1 I live in Brookhaven right now, and I drill in Statesboro. Basic's in Lawton, OK, and AIT is in San Angelo, TX.

1 Roll tide!
1 Oh wait...
1 No, it's worse than that even. They marry muslim kids! See how that's worse?
1 In Alabama they just also marry them.... After raping them.
1 Seems like that ship has sailed. The most annoying thing about such discussions for me, is that I will totally grant that *right now* Islamic fundamentalism is dangerous in a way that is unique. At this exact moment. But, 99 times out of 100, people can't actually make that argument because the subtext is, "And that's why my religion is better!" when it as you say, is just about fundamentalism. 
1 Just go to Europe, especially the northern parts are still very anti fundamentalism but don't mind moderate religious beliefs at all. It doesn't apply to all, but a clear majority. News outlets might not report this since it's not "a juicy story". 
1 Good luck. I'm about to move to Kentucky, so I think i'll be feeling the same way soon.
1 And Bible Law is even worse because there's a realistic chance of it being enacted.
1 Islam is an evil religion that promotes violence, degrades women, and worships a pedophile!Thank the lord we have someone like Roy Moore, praise Jesus! if we get him elected we can start fighting back in the name of Christianity! We will Nuke the entire middle east and turn it into a glass desert! And after we get rid of those evil muslims, we can finally bring back traditional values where women know their role and stay home in the kitchen looking after kids. &nbsp;&nbsp;/s 
1 Well Mary was a virgin, duh....
1 "It's not pedophilia when god does it"
1 She also famously didn’t have sex with Joseph; it’s kind of important to the story.
1 well, She was a virgin right?also, you're talking 2k years ago? 14 really ain't bad. NOW? come on.
1 but they have no proof of that, and it most certainly is not in the Bible. The "reasoning" is: people got married young back then in general, so Mary did, so its "Dicks out for Haram-be"! None the less, it makes for pretty convenient speculation when you are hell bent on sin.
1 Mary was immaculate conception, so there still wasn't penetration :|
1 Straight marriage isn't a sin. Ever /s
1 Actually “transgendered” is also considered impolite. “Transgender” is more correct (the argument being that being transgender isn’t something that has been done to a person).Also I think they were emulating the speech of someone who doesn’t know the difference.
1 Molesting little girls is illegal, and being trans doesn't make it legal, so who cares? 
1 > I don't think "transgendered" men going into bathrooms and molesting girls is all that outlandish and I think it's already happened. I used quotations because he wasn't a true transgendered man he was just some creep saying that so he could molest little girls, but it will definitely happenWhy are you so sure? If you live in an urban area it's almost certain you've shared a restroom with a trans person at least once and not even known it.
1 If we actually listened to them, we'd have these [huge bushy men](https://i.imgur.com/bUmidhh.jpg) going into female bathrooms. And [this](https://i.imgur.com/T6hyD9V.jpg) person would be forced to use the male restroom putting themselves at major risk if these supposed sexual assaulters really are everywhere.

1 You made us elect him by criticizing the racists!
1 Is that really a “nope”? https://youtu.be/mCB6RvRojIQ
1 Yet they are on the wrong side of basically every single topic. They cause harm with each decision, to no benefit of their own. (Unless they're the extremely rich Repubs in charge, but anyone else just gets shafted.) Either they're stupid or they're malicious. 
1 Isn't it Alabama where you only need one parents consent too? So it doesn't matter if Dad doesn't like it. If Mom says yes it's gonna happen
1 Most European countries have a younger age of consent than the US so it's not like it's an American thing. 
1 America! The NSA controls everything we see and hear, Comcast is going to take the rest, and we can marry children! Whoo! 
1 Yeah I too fail to see how child rape is made better when you add in a component of parental abuse
1 I can't vouch for accuracy but I once read of a civilization/group of people (possibly extra-ancient greece) that took awhile to realize that it was in fact sex and semen that caused pregnancy.So I mean, I guess it may be possible for the body to know it wants sex (because kids), but not for the mind to know that sex and the resulting fluids is what causes it.Also doesn't help if you're lied to about it...
1 If you find that hard to believe, then you probably haven't seen what a lot of Christians and Catholics teach their kids, especially in the Southern US...
1 I can believe it. Public education in a lot of parts of the US is rather poor. Given how sex is an especially touchy subject for other certain parts of the country, then you could reasonably see a dumb kid who doesn't know better.Granted, I think said kid probably wouldn't be the smartest in the first place but the lack of education makes it far worse than it should be.
1 > I find it very hard to believe that someone wouldn't know where babies come from. This is the kind of thing that kids talk about way before it's taught in school.“You liberals and your fancy-pants ‘education’! We don’t need ‘schools’ or ‘teaching’ here in God’s country!”
1 What will be your excuse when he wins the senate election?
1 I'll try and whip up some more tonight or tomorrow if I get a chance. I'm just hoping at least *one* of these goes viral enough to make a difference.I'm also going to try and focus on the fact that we'd have to worry about children if Moore was elected. Because who's to say he won't try and "be friendly" with other teenage girls if he got away with it so far?And, well, it's been shown that conservative voters are motivated by fear and anxiety, so it's best to focus on the terrible *personal* results of what might happen with his victory. (Are they concerned about transgender people assaulting children in public restrooms even though the studies show that's an unreasonable fear? Well then, why aren't they worried about someone who's already done stuff with other kids? What if it's *their* kid next? *Think about the children.*)
1 Ah, thanks. Hadn't seen or read that.
1 Most states have sexual consent at 16 or 18.  I’m not a lawyer, but I’d assume sex is allowed within a marriage below the age of consent.  My guess would be that consenting to a marriage (plus consent of parents and government) would mean statutory rape laws don’t apply between marriage partners.
1 Eugh. Yep, that's where the system goes from "Weird, but i guess there are fringe cases where it could be ok" to "Why the hell are these laws still on the books?"  Court orders and judge appearances stand to protect people who are forced or coerced into a marriage they don't want or aren't ready for.... but that only works if we assume the courts and judges are unbiased and non-creepy.  Which sadly isn't always the case.
1 I need a shower after reading that
1 Then why would you marry a 14 and 74 year old. Not exactly getting a ton of babies out of that. It’s a way to control women. Always has been, regardless of the excuse of the time. 
1 That's not what pragmatic means though. If it's simply to achieve one goal with no consideration for the negative consequences, that's by definition not pragmatic. 
1 Where does it say that or am I supposed to just infer that? 
1 I'm fairly certain that post was meant as sarcasm.
1 Southern conservatives: "I'm not racist. I just think black people should know their place. Like my one black friend whose existence makes me not a racist."

1 Just letting you know that you are awesome! and thank you for helping out your fellow citizens exercise their rights :)
1 That's the right attitude.  spread the poll drive people all around the state so that no area is left uncovered. don't even wait for people to call for your help, just drive around the neighborhoods with a bull horn asking if anybody wants to go vote, you can have them there in 10 mins! ect! 
1 Volunteer to get rural voters to the polls too. Some Dems won't be able to make it far, or they don't have working cars. 
1 Also, spread [these](https://imgur.com/a/CPjbl) images about the election everywhere. It's one week away, so it's crunch time. Voter turnout will be very important.

1 I know it happens at my grandmother's church.  I've heard her talking about it.  At my great aunts' church as well (2 great aunts, 2 great uncles, their kids, and their grandkids all go to it), as they have mentioned the same.  But, what am I supposed to say?  Report it to the IRS and say that I was told this by family members?  They would absolutely deny it if an IRS agent asked them about it.  Plus, it is so commonplace in Alabama that it would be harder to find churches that DON'T do this than ones that do.  If the IRS wanted to punish them for it, they could literally just stick an agent in each church around election times and have all the evidence they need.
1 A handful have.  Not enough to really matter in Alabama.
1 And to be fairer a larger number endorsed him more strongly.
1 Yeah, that sounds about right.
1 Yes.
1 > Also it's a pain in the ass when you show up at a polling booth, having registered, having your drivers license, but be told that since you moved you can't vote there.Yeah.  I moved to Tennessee from Alabama, and it took me like 3 different attempts to finally get everything completed to get my voter registration updated.  On top of that, when I went to the DMV to get my license updated (which was required), I spent the better part of the day there.  I arrived at 7:30, before it opened, and I didn't leave until ~1:30 PM.  It was fucking insane.  And, based on the numbers that people were holding and the speed that they were going, a lot of people were not going to get served that day, even though they arrived in the morning.Of course, this DMV was located in a part of town that is lower income and has a higher percentage of non-white residents.  I later found out that I could have went to a different DMV, located in a more affluent / white part of town, and been in and out in less than an hour.
1 But but but is there proof that there is proof of proof? 
1 If the entire election hinges on an accusation, there should be due process to determine its validity. However, I understand that in politics libel and slander are common tactics from the left (especially if they are desperate).  
1 Where’s the proof that his hands were ABOVE her?If I rape someone, but the woman admitted later that she enjoyed it, I’m still a rapist. Classic Lib double standard.
1 >tends to seem more pressing once someone is about to become a senator.oh, but not a judge? interesting.
1 show me proof that he did. as i've said, *to me* it is *highly* suspect that these allegations would be made *now* instead of say, when they happened, or even when he became a judge. i'm absolutely *convinced* that there are republicans *and* democrats in our government that are pedophiles, i'm just highly skeptical of these particular allegations; i'm genuinely shocked that more people aren't.
1 ...well shit. I knew that, too. Now I look like a dang fool; arguing with a TrumpTroll and I can't even distinguish my Cats from my Classes.
1 So those signatures in those girls yearbooks that match each other perfectly? Just all part of the giant conspiracy? 
1 But Trump is killing children. Why are we talking about Clinton?
1 They'll still say it's a fake leftist politicization of legitimate period-appropriate romance. It's a cult. 
1 Trump was the one Epstien had multiple phone numbers and contacts for that would visit his island and go to "service" at the "temple" with. 
1 Imagine using the statue of limitations to defend a child molester."Yeah he might have diddled kids but it was so long ago that we can't convict and that makes him a stand up dude"
1 They never got their due process because he abused his position in the DA to silence them.  
1 > My complaint is with the site that wrote the article and their choice of titleIt's the most appropriate title. Like I said, the article is about something Jones said. Do you honestly believe, "Jones tweets something" is better? Is this the first article you've ever seen where the quote is the title? It's like your trying to find a way to defend Moore without actually stooping so low. 
1 So you are saying abortion is murder, but you don’t want to put the women who are paying for said “murder” in jail?This how you know you have a disingenuous argument on your hands
1 So let's charge Ted Kennedy with a crime, then. Oh wait.
1 Nobody said it wasn't a big deal, but it happened 48 years ago and Ted Kennedy is dead. What does it have to do with the allegations against Roy Moore in the here and now?
1 That's true. But some 16 year old who pumps out a kid and spends the next 30 years on welfare doesn't thrill me either and that happens all the damn time. Might be callous but I'd prefer an abortion in that situation over paying for someone else being a fuck up.
1 Yeah, I'm anti-abortion in most cases and even still I'm not going to deny that it does overall benefit society and the environment. The way I see it is that, let's say you're stranded on an island with a few people. There's definitely enough food and other supplies for everyone, but things sure could be more comfortable if one person wasn't there anymore, and Bob sure has been having a bit more than his share.You talk with your fellow men and make the group decision to kill Bob in his sleep with a bullet to his head. He'd die instantly, painlessly, and wouldn't know what hit him. Ethically speaking, I just think that's a horrible thing to do. 
1 Quote please.  Don’t think I said anything of the sort, so if it’s a boat, you are on it alone.
1 It's too bad the lying fake media has lost all credibility by constantly attacking conservatives, taking things out of context and calling everyone who happens to disagree with the far left agenda a racist, sexist, homophobic bigot, colluding with the DNC, etc. etc. etc. etc. ad infinite...Because if the media had actually been doing their jobs this whole time and not being partisan pieces of shit, then people would not be able to claim this is "fake news" so easily.But the media has done all these things.  And now, when it actually matters, nobody cares.  Sad.And for those of you complaining about FOX puhleeese.  It's ONE freaking conservative network.  The left has ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and every other network, all of Hollywood and nearly every print publication doing their bidding.But oh wahhhh FOX news!!!!!   stfu- TLDR : Roy Moore is a disgusting piece of crap but the cry wolf left biased media hasn't done their jobs so nobody believes them when it matters.
1 But I thought cops were racist pigs that didn’t deserve there position? Or am I getting the talking points wrong 
1 I don't know you or your plans, but based on what you said here and my own experience... go active, not guard, right off the bat and get your degree while enlisted. You want to get out of that mess and on with your life? Go active and don't look back. 
1 Seems like you found something that you really enjoy and also something that pays for your bills simultaneously, be very happy about that. This is one of those big things in life people hope to achieve.
1 Dude more power to you, that’s great.
1 If you're going to college and are planning an active duty career in the military then I strongly suggest that you join the Army ROTC program and become an officer. The pay difference is reason enough to do it, not to mention all the other perks that go along with it. 
1 Very interesting. I can see how the army can be appealing when you're broke. I know they actively seek out people who are like that so that they can give them a job and something productive to do in society.What's your opinion on the misuse of the military to further politician's and other powerful people's political and personal agendas? Do you agree with the misuse or not? If you don't agree with it, how do you justify the fact that at some point in time as an individual soldier, you won't have any opinion on the matter and will have to go to war or kill civilians for the wrong reasons whether you agree with it or not? How do you justify committing what you would perceive as morally corrupt acts simply because you are "following orders"? Does that not bother you at all, or do you just sweep it under the rug and hope it doesn't develop into PTSD? Sorry, I'm not trying to be snarky, I honestly want to know how one deals with such emotional trauma, and what type of emotional barriers one puts around them to prevent it from happening.
1 Good for you - stay safe and I wish you a great career ahead. You sound like someone with a good head on their shoulders.
1 Good for you on escaping the situation. But realize that the military is designed specifically to be intoxicating and appealing to young males with little to no direction in life. The environment is designed to appeal directly to that desire to fit in, find direction, and embrace the machismo that we associate with youth.    Once you go too far down that rabbit hole, it is near impossible to come back out intact, and you quickly fall into that dangerous mindset that no one who hasn't "been there, done that" isn't worthy of holding an opinion. If and when you get out, you'll quickly find that the only people who you have anything in common with are other veterans who hold the same mindset and can't understand why anyone would hold an opposing view. And quickly enough, you go from being an individual to believing yourself a victim of a society that doesn't understand or appreciate you.    I've witnessed this time and time again - and nearly fell into it myself after I got out. 
1 Sign up for the GI bill right now if you can. You'll have to pay into it your first year, but they should kick in the rest afterward. If you don't use it, your kids can.

1 Unless we let them come here, then they're gonna marry our christian kids, and those are OURS!
1 That's the joke.
1 > The most annoying thing about such discussions for me, is that I will totally grant that right now Islamic fundamentalism is dangerous in a way that is unique.Only in those parts of the world where it is dominant. In the US, Muslims are outnumbered close to a hundred to one, and right wing fundamentalist "christian" policies are killing far more people every day. 
1 There's also the fact that good ol' Christian America has a huge hand in developing and encouraging fundamentalists in the middle east. We went from funding, training, and arming tribes we didn't understand to outright creating terrorist cells to help push wahhabism in areas we wanted to destabilize. It's a strategy we developed in South America and really perfected. /s

It's one thing to disagree, but to personally sentence them to the Hell that you believe in because they *don't* believe in it sounds like the least Christian thing I've ever heard. 
1 Yeah, it's fucked up. They are upset because they want to have a monopoly on religious control. Oh and they don't want anyone else to fuck their children, only they are allowed. Godamn pigs.

1 ...so Joseph claimed.
1 Right, God himself just wanted to impregnate a 14 year old.
1 my understanding is that betrothal was usually longer. In Mary's case that didn't make sense.
1 And yet Moore apologists used exactly the "Mary was 14" argument to defend him. Logic need not apply when you have faith. 
1 She was still married to Joseph at 12-14 and would have had to consummate if that pesky pregnancy wasn't in the way.
1 The Immaculate Conception was Mary,  who was born without sin (she was conceived normally but god scrubbed her soul while in the womb). Jesus was conceived by the holy spirit and Mary was a virgin when giving birth to him, all according to the myths. 
1 And yet Moore apologists used exactly the Mary was 14 argument to defend him
1 I did not have sexual relations with that woman!<wink wink>
1 I think they probably just don't know the difference because language surrounding anything trans is positively confusing.
1 That's a pretty useless comment. It's pretty clear that republicans see this as an avenue for predators to more easily molest their children.  Don't respond with a comment on their hypocrisy with Roy Moore or stricter gun laws. We know they are hypocrites. This is about this specific problem. 
1 I'm not sure what you mean? I'm sure I've shared a bathroom with a transgendered man, too. And I don't have any problem with that. All I said is there is no doubt in my mind that allowing transgendered men/women to use any bathroom will allow weird and creepy pedophiles to pretend they are transgender and go into bathrooms and molest children.Does that really seem that outlandish to you? It's not like this scares me every night, it's just a fact, and the argument many republicans use against having these bathroom. Now we can always use republicans hypocrisy to dismiss their arguments but I prefer to analyze each argument rather than just dismiss to over it being a republican argument.

1 This belief (or, well, lack of) is generally attributed to the [Trobriand Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trobriand_Islands). A lot has been written about them.

1 That is a fantastic idea. I have zero shame, but I don't have a bullhorn...yet.
1 If you go far enough back the parties kind of flip in terms of values. It's somewhere around FDR. I just finished writing a 5 page paper analyzing a post-reconstruction era essay by Senator John Tyler Morgan: former confederate general, avid Civil Rights opposer, and a standard Democrat of the time.
1 Lincoln was certifiably liberal by every measurement you could make. Not the same 'Republican' we think of today. And Eisenhower was a selective sociopath, he fought for black rights but at the same time had 5,000 federal employees fired for being suspected homosexuals. He literally thought gay people were a national security threat. It's one thing at the time to be homophobic, it's an entirely different thing to act on it in that way.

1 Clinton also flew on said plane many times.  That's not proof of anything.  But the person was asking when anyone ever accused clinton of underage sex.  And the answer is that right there.
1 Just to be clear, I agree with Jones, Roy Moore is human scum and should be put in jail, not in the senate. I'm just saying Kennedy isn't that far behind.Ted Kennedy was last elected to the senate in 2006, only 11 years ago. He was politically active until 2009 and campaigned for Obama. As near as I can tell, not a single Democrat ever called him on his actions. I agree that this is different than Roy Moore who is seeking election *today*, but only by 11 years. Not that big a difference if you ask me.

1 That’s the reason I haven’t gone active duty already. I’m doing ROTC while in college. I’d be stupid not to. 
1 To start, I do agree that the power of the military is misused. I also think that if people always do what they think is right, that would cause way more problems. I don’t agree with it, but the military is the way it is because of cohesion. If we don’t have orders, what’s the point of the military? We’d be hundreds of thousands of people, free to do what we think is right, with billions, maybe trillions, of dollars worth of deadly equipment. If a Republican soldier believes that the morally right thing to do is to kill a family just because they’re Muslim, that’d be wrong, right?

1 >  Of course they probably will anyway.So what would be the purpose of me denying myself the entertainment value? If Alabama doesn't want the hate, they won't do things to justify it. Not electing a rapist and, perhaps, changing their laws on child marriage would be good places to start. Otherwise, whether out of spite or not, they are just affirming that kiddie-fucking is the 'bama way.
1 You realize that even if he wins there will be a large amount of people who don't vote for him?  Should those people be labeled the same, because of the other assholes in their state?  How would you feel if a foreign person assumed you're a trump type just because you're American?  Be an adult. Judge people as individuals, not by the group of people around them.

1 >right wing fundamentalist "christian" policies are killing far more people every dayyou mean like abortion?
1 What Christian policies do you consider to have killed more people than 9/11?
1 > push wahhabism in areas we wanted to destabilizeWe also did it to counter the arab nationalist movement because we were worried about losing influence to the soviets. Pretty fucked up on our part.
1 Also something that most of those people don't care about or understand, unfortunately.
1 Back in Aug / September 2011 one of the UK terrestrial TV channels (maybe ITV but I can't remember) was showing all the Rambo films as their late night weekend movie special.I'd seen the first two previously but watched the 3rd (on I'd guess the 12th-14th Sept) which I hadn't seen. I hadn't known about the Afghan conflict of the at all and at one point there is a speech about why they should be supplying the Afghans etc. Obviously an action movie but with all that came out after...pretty eye opening.
1 What's the /s for? Isn't this pretty much how things have gone?

1 ........not that you're aware of.
1 > sentence them to the Hell that you believe in because they *don't* believe in it sounds like the least Christian thing I've ever heard. Maybe I missed a few lessons in Bible study as a kid, but isn't this literally the premise of Christianity? Believe in Jesus or go to hell. What am I missing here?
1 It's actually pretty obvious. The extremist Muslims(you know, the terrorists) remind them of themselves. People always tend to lash out most at the negative things which remind them of themselves. The concept of Sharia law is terrifying to them, because they are aware enough to know given the chance, they would invoke the equivalent "christian law" in a heartbeat, but they can justify it to themselves by pretending they are somehow different... despite all evidence to the contrary, such as defending a fucking child diddler. You don't view a difference of religion as a negative thing, so why would you feel any hatred or desire to harm or kill them? It's just different. Some of these folks view anyone who isn't of their own religion as an incarnation of satan trying to destroy their faith. I know this because my neighbors think I'm *literally*, not figuratively, satan, and that I came up to test their faith by trying to destroy their children's lives. They are convinced their view is righteous, and as a result, can justify to themselves lumping all Muslims(really, all non-christains in my neighbors particular case) in with the extremists and "send them back to hell where they belong". 
1 As an agnostic, the thing that always bothers me with vocal Christians is the fact that they feel the need to act.  If you believe in a heaven and hell, and you believe that bad people will be going to hell, why do you need to involve yourself?  The system is set up to work without you doing anything.  Sure you can say the "Christian" thing to do is try and warn people, but after they fail to head the warnings, why is anything else required?
1 [Surely you've all seen this?](https://youtu.be/KYV7KWQ-fY4)
1 There are some people who've been convinced that literally every Muslim is ISIS
1 > but to personally sentence them to the Hell that you believe in because they don't believe in it sounds like the least Christian thing I've ever heardEhhh... sort of. Youre spot on in terms of *personally* condemning them (Matthew 7:1-5 has something to say about that, although 7:6 unfortunately dilutes the point a bit).But christianity in general is pretty heavily based on "either accept Jesus or you dont go to heaven." (simplified).&nbsp;The gaping flaw in most interpretations is that you're supposed to convince people by virtue of acts and goodwill, not fire and brimstone threats.

1 This action just solidifies that his only mission is to sow discord and promote chaos. He breaks every longstanding presidential tradition, he attacks all of our international allies, while praising the worst dictators in the world. He gets into a pissing contest with a nuclear nation. He appointed people who will destroy the departments they are running. He attacks News organizations. He attacks Intelligence agencies.  He equates Neo-nazis and the KKK with their protesters. Shit he even tried to revoke Obama's turkey pardon. This is just one more thing in a long line of senseless destructive actions. People elected him because they wanted to watch the world burn, and it looks like they're going to get it.

1 While I don't want to be mistaken for defending this ancient custom, I often see Joseph depicted as basically middle-aged (or older) in art and nativity sets, which derives from an early tradition and is probably very inaccurate. It was very taboo in first-century Judea for a man to be unmarried by the time he reached the age of 20,  so it's very likely that Joseph and Mary were within a few years of each other in age. I think there's some discussion to be had on the merits of the cultural norm of thrusting marriage responsibilities onto teenagers, but I also think the common assumption of an age gap between Mary and Joseph that would be downright predatory (certainly by modern standards) is inaccurate. 
1 >Although an understanding of reproduction and modern medicine is widespread in Trobriand society, their traditional beliefs have been remarkably resilient. For example, the real cause of pregnancy is believed to be a baloma, or ancestral spirit, that enters the body of a woman, and without whose existence a woman could not become pregnant; all babies are made or come into existence (ibubulisi) in Tuma. These tenets form the main stratum of what can be termed popular or universal belief. In the past, many held this traditional belief because the yam, a major food of the island, included chemicals (phytoestrogens and plant sterols) whose effects are contraceptive, so the practical link between sex and pregnancy was not very evident(For the curious-but-lazy)
1 Yeah, it seems to me like those are relics of the times where women were considered baby assembly lines, but what are you going to do.  I mean, I personally don't care if a 16-year old and a 19-year old who are in a healthy relationship want to make things official, tie the knot, and bone legally. Though I think that most age of consent laws have exceptions for situations of close age or being barely over the age of majority.But it's hard to imagine a good reason for a 27-year old to marry a 14-year old, because there's just no way that a healthy partnership can exist between two people in such different stages of life, with such different sets of priorities, goals, and experience.  And apparently that's what's happening in a decent percentage of these cases.  And, I guess, that's what makes a guy like Roy Moore seem normal to a good chunk of the people of Alabama.  
1 This is true. Men can make babies until pretty much the end. Its women (with all the proper equipment) that start having issues as they get a bit past the prime childbearing years. Doesnt change the creep factor of an old man marrying a young woman tho.
1 I was wondering why I’m getting downvoted for asking. Thank you. 
1 It's really not.Arguably if your sarcasm/satire *doesn't* leave a decent proportion of the audience going "wait...", you aren't doing it right. If everyone understands it effortlessly, you have failed and may as well not have written it.
1 The Civil Rights divide has pretty much always been north vs south. Northern Democrats were much more likely to be on the better side of this, and what few southern Republicans were around generally were not.
1 Yes the Southern Dems went to the Republican Party at some point I believe I’ve read.

1 > So why isn't the Conservative Right media covering this? Why are they protecting him? Can they not investigate for themselves? Or are they simply just saying the opposite of whatever the left media says? The conservative media is really no better.Also, Alex and Breitbart are not mainstream. There are plenty of left wing side streams out there too.  Politico, Mother Jones, Daily Kos...  I'm talking major networks with major influence on the masses.I'll give you Rush even though he's basically just talk radio.The media, in general, has not done its job in a long long time.  They are all sell outs and no longer protect the people of this country like they should.  The 4th estate is gone.

1 That does change things slightly. Active duty recruiters can sometimes work some back room magic. If you change your mind stop in and see one. Best of luck to you. 
1 I agree with you that the military requires cohesion. That is not up for debate. But if you're aware that the military's power is misused, and that you are very likely to be part of that corruption if you joined, why would you join? Perhaps if you had the intention to make the military a better place, with high hopes to rise to the top and fix it yourself, I can see how that can be a motivation. But if you don't plan to fix it yourself, do you just hope someone else will fix it before the corruption gets to you? Either way, you're still going to have to deal with it if it happens. If you ever kill a child by unintentional bombing because you were ordered to, are you just going to tell yourself "the military needs cohesion" over and over again? That might be enough for your sanity, but I don't think that would work for mine. For what it's worth, I think the military needs to have more checks and balances so that it can't be wielded by any one person or entity. I think Congress needs to exercise their right more frequently to control the actions of the military. And also we need to vote in the right representatives into Congress so that they can do their jobs the right way, without any political corruption, and with only the safety of the people of the United States in mind. Until then, I believe the military is going to continue to be misused for a long time.

1 People, not fertilized cell lumps.
1 Abstinence only sex ed. Like, by orders of magnitude.
1 "Christian Policies" are kinda hard to define, as everyone will say, "My religion doesn't say that, etc"  But, if you look at the policies of Evangelical Christians, and the people that they elect, then you have a sense for the policies that these "christians" (and I'm doing them a favor by putting that term in quotes) vote for policies such as Abstinence Only (and tell children that Condom's don't work), as well as healthcare (Current GOP tax bill will devastate low income healthcare in this country), and historically stupid shit like limiting research into Stem Cells (which is less important now, as not fetal stem cells are available).  The Christian right is attacking the poor in this country, and the cognitive dissonance should be deafening...  But it isn't.
1 Abstinence only sex ed was a good one.I'd add, climate change denial, which is **huge** among fundamentalist Christians. Along those lines:https://www.cbsnews.com/news/air-pollution-deaths-expected-to-rise-because-of-climate-change/

1 While I agree with you and that specific breed of argument, that type of rationalization gets to be a rabbit hole though. For example, Without Cyrus the Great freeing the captive Jews exiled in Babylon, Judaism might've been wiped off the face of the earth and then Christianity and Islam wouldn't exist, solving all our problems, right?So in conclusion, shit's complicated. Or blame the Persians. That one actually is pretty evergreen.
1 Butt only in truck stop bathrooms and only if you don't make eye contact.
1 Well, you may have missed the lesson where we are not the arbiter of judgment, God is. Also he said >personally sentencewhich implies actually killing them (the act of killing is the sentencing of their damned soul to hell), which is like the 6th commandment? I can't remember which for sure, but killing is a no-no, judging is a no-no, killing because you're judging is a no-no-no.
1 No you're absolutely right. My point is I'm a Christian who believes in what you've stated, Jesus is the way blah blah. Why would I *murder* someone who I know doesn't follow Jesus? Not only am I taking their life but I'm also sending them to the Hell that I believe in because he isn't a Christian. That's the lowest of the low, at least in my book. It goes beyond ending a life, it's damning their soul edit: and it's not "believe in Jesus or go to hell" it's "believe in Jesus and you'll live in paradise forever" btw ;)
1 > after they fail to head the warnings, why is anything else required?Nothing else really is. The Bible tells us it's our job to lead people to God (e.g. church, the bible, etc) and it's his job to do the rest. I can invite you to church but what happens after that is strictly between you and God. And the reason I involve myself is I don't want to see anyone go to Hell. I hear it sucks big time
1 "This is between God and I. Where the fuck do *you* play into any of this?"  These troglodytes don't consider that punishing others on behalf of God is saying that you know God's thoughts and intent, and if a mortal being is able to read God's mind, then he is not an all-powerful, omnipotent being. Performing actions on his behalf is *literally* playing the role of God, and I'm sure there's a passage somewhere saying that doing that is not cool.  On top of that, their very own book tells them not to do such a thing. So even the most dense Christian with zero critical thinking skills should still abstain from attacking others in the name of God. 
1 lol I haven't and can't watch now. Please tell me it's satire
1 I did have a prominent church member say to me, and I quote, "I don't like Muslims because they kill people, but I respect them for at least following their holy book."like...... what in the fuck..?
1 Sounds like someone much smarter than him's agenda too.
1 My understanding is that it was common to promise a girl to someone years before she actually marries the person, in the jewish culture two thousand years ago.  Rushing the marriage makes sense no matter which way you look at it. Either she was carrying God's son, and an angel told her and Joseph to go ahead and get married right away, or she was a 14 year old pregnant girl, with a need to legitimize that bastard ASAP.

1 Sure. But most top Democrats who are active today were also active 11 years ago. And they didn't lift one finger back then against Kennedy. That's why there's a bit of hypocrisy involved when top Democrats climb the highest horses they can find around Republicans not crusading against Moore.
1 How silly the above argument is.I'm not a trumpet, quite the opposite, unless you mean I'm like a loud horn, which I have been accused of before.

1 You're talking about calling out people that didn't make those choices. Yes, if someone does something wrong you should call them out. If someone does not do something wrong, you shouldn't blame them for the fact their neighbor did something wrong. 
1 This is a matter of belief. 
1 Good post, I didn't even agree with it until I thought about all the people that would have contracted HIV (at rates higher than states with reasonable sex Ed) 
1 Can you elaborate a bit? I see abstinence only as a serious issue but it’s not clear to me what the death toll is coming from or how large it is.
1 Yeah this is also a good one.
1 > but killing is a no-no,  > judging is a no-no,  > killing because you're judging is a no-no-no.  I disagree. killing because you're judging clearly should be a no-no-no-no.
1 So dying of natural causes and being sent to hell for all eternity for not believing in your imaginary friend is totally fine with you, but you draw the line at ending their life yourself?Gotta love them good christian values...
1 But you still believe in damning their soul. You just aren't willing to get your hands dirty doing it.Edit for your edit: if you don't go to "paradise" for eternity then you by default go to hell. You can try and put a sugar coating on it all you want, but it's still *believe in Jesus or go to hell.* Saying it as a positive doesn't make the negative version of the statement untrue.
1 The absolute best of satire, yes
1 I spoke to an ultra orthodox Jewish woman once who told me she had to cross the street because a couple of Arabs were on the same side as her and she was afraid she would get murdered. She legit believed that, given the chance, any Arab would happily murder Jews in the street.

1 I mean god took 2/10 commandments to make sure you weren't listening to the other "prophets" but rape would have made it 11. Shits just too confusing, only got 10 fingers.
1 Those aren't my values, I'm not a Christian. I just wanted to help you see through your vitriol to what the commenter was saying, since you kinda just decided to make it about shitting on religion right out of the gate for whatever reason.You asked about missing something, so I showed you what you missed. If you want to yell at somebody about religion talk to someone else. 
1 Not at all! I'm happy to tell them the good news
1 I don't, i'm sorry. That was fucked up. I haven't eaten lunch yet. 
1 Agreed but unless you can prove the soul only enters the fetus after the medically placed cutoffs for abortion then people who believe in souls should see abortion as an ongoing holocaust. I don’t think they are right about the existence of anything supernatural  but it follows logically from their belief system. 
1 That runs us into the territory of counting the additional births vs the increased murder rate. It might still work out to a net positive in population. I think the STD argument others have made seems cleaner.
1 What degree did you get where 2 + 2 = 3?
1 Pointing out that the entire premise of Christianity is that you go to heaven if you believe in Jesus, while literally everyone else is burned for eternity in a lake of fire and sulfur, is now "shitting on religion"?Interesting...
1 And just fine with your god burning them for eternity for questioning his existence with 0 evidence. Completely reasonable, in the mind of a christian
1 Transgressional math is not the same as arithmetic. 
1 No, but you intentionally left out the part where this guy said killing people is unchristian simply to get a jab in about eternal damnation being part of the religion. Then you continued to make some ridiculous argument that someone's belief in a system is actually equivalent to them perpetuating the damnation themselves and considered those "good Christian values".It's pretty transparent what your intentions were from the get go, and with the rest of your comments in this thread my hunch seems to be confirmed. At any rate you don't seem interested in considering anything that involves introspection so I'm wasting time discussing it.
1 I feel like you're just trying to start a fight with me. Have you read the bible? You should try it. It's really not half bad. 
1 killing because you're judging appears to be the most efficient use of transgression, then.
1 Well, since I wasn't talking to you in the first place and have no interest in introspecting about religion (did that as a teenager and realized it was all bullshit designed to control people through fear). Bye Felicia!
1 I have read it. It's what made me an atheist.I have a hard time worshipping a god who's cool with rape, slavery, genocide, and eternal damnation. [That book is one of the most violent disgusting works of fiction I've ever read.](https://m.news24.com/MyNews24/The-14-Most-Abominable-Bible-Verses-20121224)
1 To the contrary; most pre-Christians who then become atheists do so after having *actually* read it, as opposed to having carefully selected passages from it read to them from their pastors (especially when in the context of seeing how other supposed Christians behave in ways antithetical to the theology - the Prosperity Gospel heresy is a good example here).I truly appreciate the good works many Christians do; their charitable works, their support for the poor, and so forth (although, as always, I wish they could do the same without the religious motivation to do such things). But there is a rot within.In many ways, Christians now face a similar problem with extremists that Islam does (predominately in the US, but also in many African countries). It's easy to wash one's hands of it, and say that those problems are their problems, and theirs alone, and that they are not true Christians, but they reflect upon the actions of the rest of you - and I'm not seeing much in the way of a pushback to it. Muslims are starting to push back now, realising that it will take active effort in their part to root out the extremists to clear their name for the betterment of them all, but a similar movement is now required for Christians.
1 That kind of conclusion is why I shouldn't dabble in divine math. 
1 While you're correct from an implementation perspective, the source material is almost always at odds with the usage. Its like somebody hijacking well intentioned software using a security vulnerability. Guy who wrote it didnt have ill intent but it was used for harm all the same.
1 So you've compiled 14 bad bible verses, and just went ahead and threw out all the good ones? Guess you've figured out Christianity! 
1 You have to take all of christianity or none of it. This is just a sample of the horrors in the chrsitian bible. You don't get to cherry pick what you like and what you don't. It's not a buffet, you accept all of it or none of it. You don't get to just ignore the parts of your religion that you don't like. Well, you can but, then your just another hypocrite.
1 It's not about ignoring the parts I don't like. It's about understanding the reasoning and the context. Why do I care if God zaps 50,000 people? He's God. He can do whatever he wants. And the stories of sex slavery and are all Old testament laws and stories. Do you get offended when you read the Code of Hammurabi? And you say "incestuous rape is *cool*" but do you know how that story in 2 Kings ends? I mean, the bible literally condones the act as evil the very next verse. Tell me, when you typed up that super edgy cool synopsis did you google "14 Abominable Bible Verses" and just copy and paste? But in reality this conversation will go nowhere. We can agree to disagree, friend.

6751 This creates a very interesting situation for hockey.  The NHL is already pulled out of the Winter Olympics.  The KHL might pull out in response to this too, which would further lower the level of players participating in the tournament.
16057 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment."So they will boycott something they aren't invited to?
9692 Thanks to [Grigory Rodchenkov's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Rodchenkov?wprov=sfla1) testimony and his journal, this massive scandal came to light. Even though he shaped the Russian doping program himself, he risked and still risks his life to make it public. He deserves massive respect from all sides.The IOC's measures have previously been laughable. Rodchenkov's journal left them no chance but to ban Russia. 
3055 This is unprecedented in size. Hopefully we will look back and see this is a turning point into taking doping seriously and cracking down.
1072 Watched "Icarus" on Netflix two nights ago. This is about the shadiest thing I've ever seen in sports: State sponsored doping for athletes. After watching the documentary, I was surprised that the IOC allowed Russia to participate in Rio. If you haven't seen "Icarus" I highly recommend it.
2530 Good. Their blatant cheating in Sochi needed to be punished.Everyone should watch the “Icarus” documentary.
143 This is a win for anti-corruption in the world.I just hope those who helped make this happen watch out for polonium sandwiches.

105 Tomorrows headline: I.O.C board members commit mass suicide by self inflicted stab wounds to the back; their bodies found floating in the Rhine.   
417 Really happy the athletes that are clean and didn't cheat still get to compete!
1712 Real sick of Putin at this moment.For the past few years, what positive thing has he accomplished for Russia or for the world? He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.
96 *In an elaborate overnight operation at the 2014 Sochi Games, a team assembled by Russia’s sports ministry tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition. More than two dozen Russian athletes have been disqualified from the Sochi standings as a result, and Olympic officials are still sorting through the tainted results and rescinding medals.*They were doping *during* the Olympics.
15 Not just any kind of doping.  State sponsored doping! Lol
514 Good. 
231 Highly, highly recommend the documentary *Icarus* on Netflix. It's all about this and it's my favorite doc of the year thus far.
51 > Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that Russia won zero medals.I can't imagine Putin letting any Russian athletes do this.Edit: > Team Russia, hockey one, sent a letter to Putin asking to allow them to play at the Olympics under neutral flag. In October Russian president said it's unacceptable and never shared any other opinion[Source](https://twitter.com/igoreronko/status/938151855670157318)
275 So what you're saying is, Russia cheats.Surprise surprise.
106 I hate it for the clean ones who dedicated their lives to this moment but I support the ban!!!     
198 Jesus Fucking Christ, they didn't even ban the goddamn *Nazis* from the Olympics.That's gotta' sting.Also, how fucking pathetic do you have to be to cheat at the Olympics? Like, there's no *real* prize at the end. You know that, right? It's not like the Olympics people give you a hundred GDPs for winning.EDIT: This comment really pissed off the Russians. They're pissier than Donald Trump's hotel bed in Moscow.
16 Again? Jesus Russia get your shit together. I feel bad for honest athletes in Russia right now
223 UPDATE: President Trump has asked President Putin if any of the athletes doped, Putin has denied it, and President Trump believes him.  President Trump is now curious when the IOC will begin investigating Hillary Clinton for doping.  
7 They are banned... Kind of. The individual sports are still allowed to determine whether Russian atheletes can compete (assuming they weren't caught doping before), and if they do they must use an Olympic outfit and Anthem. Huge fine though that will pay for investigation and future anti-doping measures which is a good thing. Russia cheats on everything nowadays, it seems. 
77 Wow, I knew that the doping was a huge problem, but I'm shocked the IOC actually will go this far to punish Russia. Especially since Russia paid them millions for the 2014 Olympics. Gotta feel awful for the athletes that want to represent their country. Most didn't even know they were getting doped by their coaches, but they'll they get punished for their stupidity. 
25 Wow I also sort of hadn't really processed that the olympics were in South Korea this year.   That's gonna be a tense couple of weeks.  Odds on Putin trying to throw matches on the political climate to get the games canceled? 
13 Well I guess Ovechkin doesn't have to worry about playing in the Olympics anymore this year
12 Can we please ban Russia from the 2018 US elections too?  
6 Russia banned **again** for doping **again**
6 Icarus on Netflix explains exactly how Russia was involved. It was an amazing documentary. A must see.
6 "Clean" athletes will still be able to compete as individuals/teams under the olympic flag.I don't exactly see what's the problem
27 "Crooked IOC just unfairly barred Russia from 2018 Winter Olympics. What about Crooked Hillary and her husband Bill? They've been doping for years! Sad! I will invite Russian athletes to join the US team and give them free covfefe." - @realDonaldTrump
10 Nice to see that the IOC has grown a set.
5 The power of Icarus
6 Wait, like, the entire country's team is banned, not just one sport? This is huge.
5 Great. I'm still salty over that 2014 Winter Olympic figure skating bias judging
5 lul
1 I like. Bill burrs idea of having a doping Olympics within safe parameters. I wanna see what amazing stuff humans can do with a ton of chemicals flowing through their veins. 
3 This should be in /r/JusticeServed. 
1 I'm curious if anyone is worried (publicly) about the Olympics being in South Korea with all the missile testing in NK. I'm sure having to sound the alarms in the middle of an event would cause some havoc, and I'm almost willing to bet it happens- even if it is "just a test"
60 Good.  China are also legendary dopers and should be banned.
6 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment."You can't fire me, I quit!
6 Too bad we can't ban them from the 2020 elections.
69 *Putin bots incoming*
39 Great to see cheaters actually being punished by the Olympics. I know everyone thinks the IOC is corrupt, and they probably are, but this is a great move to make sports more legitimate competition. 
9 Is it irony that an incredibly corrupt organization like the IOC bans a country that is corrupting the sports the IOC sanctions? Or just hypocritical? 
15 Apparently,  the IOC is tougher on Russia for its transgressions in sports than the US government is for Russia’s inference with its democracy.
31 I've asked Vladimir Putin about the Doping.He says that it didn't happen.I believe him.
3 The Icarus effect. 
3 Yeah now do that for the regular Olympics and the World CUp
3 If you haven't seen icarus Netflix film . I would recommend to. It cover the doping and how they did it.its really good 
3 After the summer games I almost wonder if Russia will continue doping on purpose as a political tool. Putin has already argued that the Summer Olympics ban was a political plot. This sort of thing makes Russians feel like they have enemies. Strong-man dictators often seem to do this, maybe because people want to fight against external powers and ignore internal powers manipulating them.I don't have any evidence and this is just speculation, but I think Putin thinks like a spy and wants to cement his hold on power. He'll at least use this as best he can to stir up nationalism.
3 In response to the vastly negative comments, I think everyone should keep in mind that many of these athletes have given up the greater half of their lives training for this single event and by 2022 might be outside their prime. Many were probably forced/highly encouraged to dope. While I find the punishment to be fair and deserved, no one should be in jubilation over this decision. Also, if you haven't seen the documentary Icarus, I highly recommend it. Sheds a ton of light on the current situation. 
3 Is this because of that guy in the Netflix documentary? 
3 Wow first Matt Lauer gets "banned", now Russia, this is turning out to be a very quiet Winter Olympics.
3 Do the Russians think the Olympics are Republican elections or something?
1 > Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment.Boycott an event they aren't even going to attend in the first place. Those Russians sure know how to throw their weight around...
1 I guess I can no longer put off watching [Icarus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6333060/).  Back in a few, boys.
1 “Everyone is talking about how to punish Russia, but no one is talking about how to help Russia,” Mr. Smirnov said.STOP CHEATING THEN WE CAN TALK- the rest of the world, probably
1 # NotMyOlympics# resist
1 Shit man if it were up to me I'd let them all dope up as much as they like, would make it more exciting.
1 Can we ever trust these guys? Doping, trolling, hacking, scheming, scamming. What's next?
1 As we say in Australia, "Suffer in your Jocks!"  Now, if only FIFA could grow a spine and change the location for the 2018 World Cup as a form of punishment for Russia *'not'* shooting Flight MH17 out of the sky and murdering 298 innocent people.
1 I expect a really devastating response, Russia won't stop until they've manipulated every nation around the world installing their own fascist group of dictators.
1 It’s cool to host the World Cup though 👌🏻
1 So no NHL, and now no KHL, no Russian athletes at all. South Korea gets stuck with JV Olympics. Might as well cancel the whole thing and wait till 2022.  
1 This ain't WW2 you can't do that 
1 I'm sure Trump can get them back in, he's good at helping the Russians.
1 Article also says “Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that Russia won zero medals.”
1 Whether athletics or elections, turns out Russia can't seem to win ANYTHING without cheating....
1 Eat shit Putin. Cunt
1 Please just legalize roids and let the freaks play.
1 So stupid..everyone is doping
1 USA USA USA USA USA 
10 I mean I understand the ban. But as an American I am under no delusion. my country does the same exact thing. We dope, I would bet every penny I've ever earned on it. 
28 Fuck, I mean, I know we deserved this shit entirely (state sponsored cheating is state sponsored cheating, no way around it) but a Winter Olympics without Russia feels so hollow. Perhaps more concerning is that Putin will DEFINITELY use this as a propaganda tool, furthering "The West is out to get us!" narrative
12 Too bad the Russian people have to be humiliated for the corruption of their governing bodies/ Oligarchs.  I wish we could offer them a carrot or Olive Branch somehow, before things get unrepairable, but the aforesaid make that difficult.      
50 Has anyone put /r/the_donald on suicide watch?
23 Haha. Fuck you putin
40 GET FUCKED VLAD
6 The Olympics, the World Cup, foreign elections, their own economy... Is there anything Russia hasn't tried to corrupt?
4 Good. If you've watched Icarus on Netflix you'll probably realize two things: Russia has been cheating hard since probably the 70s and Icarus itself is probably gonna win the academy award for best documentary.
6 Trump is going to be livid. I bet there will be some angry Russians also. 
4 Will they be banned from 2018 U.S. elections too? (sorry if someone beat me to it). 
20 This is crazy! Russians totally dominate ladies' figure skating right now. Their national competition is so interesting to watch since so many girls who could be national champion in America get left behind since everyone there just that good. It will be interesting to see everyone's reaction to this. 
18 cyka blyat
19 good riddance 
10 IOC: Russia will not be allowed to compete in 2018. Putin: We could go if we wanted, we're just BOYCOTTING the games.
18 Jesus Christ Russia, get your shit together.
20 Countdown to Trump declaring war on the Olympics.
9 Russia is just a mafia state. They couldn't do anything honestly if they tried.
10 Get fucked Putin.
13 Aww. Now who will Canada beat for hockey gold? USA or Sweden?
5 Between things like this and the outrageous cost of hosting the Olympics I hope the Olympics crashes and burns and maybe gets rebuilt into something better.
18 Now who is Trump going to root for?
19 Fuck the Russians. They've been doing this shit forever.
5 Finally someone sanctioned Russia on something they cheated or meddled with ;) 
10 Even Russian bots couldn't keep this post from the front page.
15 Trump is about to make fun of the Olympics.
16 *opens popcorn* 🍿Oh don't mind me , just waiting for Trump supporters to defend Russia.
2 [deleted]
2 As expected. If Russia said they would stop then they would be admitting guilt!
2 This was the only thing stopping Team GB from Winter Olympic dominance. NOW WE WILL RULE THE WA...SNOW? AGAIN
2 Git fukt.
2 all of Russian players are banned?
2 [Netflix Documentary Icarus Trailer](https://youtu.be/qXoRdSTrR-4)Highly recommend this documentary on Netflix outlining the doping scandal in Russia. It gets really good when it gets dark.
2 The allowed athletes from Russia can borrow the neutral, unidentifying uniforms that Russia used when they invaded Ukraine to compete in.
2 Lolz at Russia
2 Git gud
2 That’s dope 
2 Get cyka'd you blyats. 
2 This is absolutely nuts! If you have the time watch the documentary on Netflix titled Icarus. It will blow your mind the hoops they went through to dope their athletes.
2 [Would totally recommend this documentary about the Russain doping scandals thoughout the Olympics.](http://www.Check.com/ out "Icarus" on Netflixwww.netflix.com/title/80168079?source=android)
2 See [Icarus](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079)
2 Just at the same time as funnily enough Russia got an amazing group for their football 2018 World Cup...
2 Dope
2 Russia and Scientology getting shit on. Today was a good day.
2 I was listening again to a podcast episode of the joe rogan experience on the exact topic, highly recommended: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCBIpKCdIIts a long interview with bryan fogel the person that basically broke the story while making a documentary about anti doping measures, its on netflix: https://www.netflix.com/watch/80168079of course the actual credit deserves Grigory Rodchenkov who essentially ruined his own life (and that of his family still in russia to this day) in order to bring this story to light.
2 One thing I don't get: the article says Russia is banned, can't participate, can't carry the flag in, etc.  Then it says Russia may boycott, and the article makes it sound like that's concerning.  How do you boycott something you're banned from?
2 > Olympic officials ruled on Tuesday that the Russia is not allowed to participateThe russia.
2 Damn I just watched ICARUS on netflix like 2days ago and i was shocked this came up
2 I think there should be an all-drug Olympics where, as Kevin Nealon said, drug use is ["perfectly legal and encouraged."](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/update-all-drug-olympics/n9691?snl=1)
2 I say, let them cheat.   Turn it into the biggest freakshow on earth!   
2 I'M NOT THE DOPE! YOU'RE THE DOPE!
2 but I watched the olympics for the doped up russians :(
2 FIFA your turn now >:]
2 Today I learned the Winter Olympics are soon.  
2 As if the Russians are the only cheaters haha. 
2 I'm very interested in what North Korea will do. There is no way they will allow the whole world to go to South Korea without pulling some shit. I'm not talking about starting a war or killing people. Just general fuckery. Testing a missile on opening ceremonies night and have it fly right over the stadium haha. 
2 It all started with the state sponsored doping of Ivan Drago and now we have this. SMH.
2 From Meduza.io:---The International Olympic Committee could be juicing Putin's re-election campaign Vladimir Putin’s still-unannounced presidential campaign is planning to exploit the International Olympic Committee’s likely decision to ban the Russian national team from competing in next year’s Winter Games, Kremlin sources [tell the independent TV network Dozhd.](https://meduza.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ff4a009ba1f59d865f0301f85&id=76ff763bf9&e=c810d362b9) Putin will reportedly use the decision as evidence of the outside world’s hostility.On December 5, Putin will participate in a national forum on volunteerism, where he’s expected to condemn the International Olympic Committee, if the organization has already banned Team Russia by then.In November, the World Anti-Doping Agency ruled that Russia remains “non-compliant” with its code, leaving in place the suspension of Russia’s anti-doping agency (RUSADA). The judgment has added more pressure on the International Olympic Committee to ban the Russian national team from the 2018 Winter Games.
2 Come on Russia, superiority can be found in fairness.  
2 If you think this is harsh just watch the Netflix documentary Icarus and you'll change your mind.
2 Everyone should see the Bigger stronger faster documentary about steroids. 
2 They couldn’t hack their way out of this one. This will have large effect on their next election cycle. 
2 Oh man I can't wait to hear Joe Rogan's take on this. Him and his podcast directed me to Icarus, very interesting 
2 Any athlete caught doping should be banned for life too 
2 “Olympic officials ruled on Tuesday that the Russia is not allowed to participate, as a country, in the 2018 Winter Games.”Wait, We’re talking about The Russia?
2 If Evgenia Medvedeva doesn't compete, I'm going to scream. She is a Russian figure skater that is the undisputed greatest of all time.
2 good, the fuckers need to understand that doping doesnt pay off
2 Hopfully Russia will start the long overdue fully augmented Olympics. Where all drugs and prosthetics are allowed.
2 Damn, I didn't think they'd do it. Go IOC.
2 Aaand the Russian media will tell about another western conspiracy against the beloved motherland...
2 Lol now the Russians gonna be like you know what screw those other countries we now hold the Russians games and if you don’t agree you will be out in jail
2 I honestly didn't think this was going to happen but it's a relief that it did. It's amazing it took them so long, we've known about this for some time now
2 Is there something about Russia that makes them want to cheat at everything? Sorry, I don't mean to sound racist(?).
2 I wonder whether such a scale of operation is really unprecedented, or is it just that Russia was the one who got caught?
2 not a huge fan of top tier hockey this year.IIHF World Juniors are in Buffalo but have the Canada vs USA game on a friday afternoon in an outdoor rink. Wtf? Atleast do it on New Years Eve. The Canada vs. USA new years eve games are always classics.    And I dunno wtf olympics are gunna be this year.    Atleastat the Jets are looking good.
2 Super curious to know what Russia's steroid cycles looked like. Asking for....myself ha
2 No duh? Wasnt there the whole waves of scandals the past few years
2 And yet they host the 2020 world cup, thanks FIFA!
2 "The liberal IOC has treated Russia very unfairly! Russia should be allowed to compete just like all other countries. Sad!" - Trump, probably. 
2 Cheaters just like in the US election.[Lilly King already did the finger wag last summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6cCwmXKhhE)
2 Them IOC officials better have some damn good security, otherwise we'll probably be hearing of them on the news for "heart attack deaths" soon.
2 I highly recommend watching the documentary ‘Icarus’ on how deep this scandal goes. I think it’s in Netflix. 
2 I feel bad for the Russian athletes that didn't dope but got fucked because of politics involved in all this
2 Reading the comments here... it’s not the doping at issue... it’s state sponsored, and carried, out doping.   Check out the documentary: Icarus by Brian Fogal.  
2 For a good laugh look at the comments on RT.com. 
2 Imagine being one of the athletes, trained since birth basically to excel at (usually) a pretty useless task that just showcases how good you are at that task vs anyone else attempting that task. And you train your whole life, put off parties, put off your social life, punish your body, receive emotional abuse from coaches, players, fans, even family potentially. And then it is your turn to go, and the whole country is banned from the Olympics for allowing their athletes to take short cuts
2 Sounds like we're all about to win us some free Krusty Burgers
2 I will miss the Russian women's curling team.  :(
2 This is political. Everyone at this level takes PEDs. Look at Simone Biles for fuck sakes. 
2 Makes sense. Just watch the movie Icarus and you will understand why Russia doesn't deserve to participate in the Olympics
2 If you are interested in an opinion from someone from Russia, I will say that this is totally deserved. I don't know any more details about it than you, but I heard about the situation a lot. And if some shitbags cheat during competitive sports they should be 100% banned.It's sad to see your own country to be involved in such scandals. And it's not like people here are bad and support such behavior, but small but powerful minority makes the whole country look bad.The question for me is, how much sportsmen were influenced by others to take doping. You see, during Sochi event, we sucked ass for the first days. And then, all of a sudden we started getting gold medals in like everything. It's quite a shame for the president if his men represent his country bad during the event which is hosted in his own country. So if fair play ain't bringing results, is it someone just pulling the doping trigger or it's sportsmen's own intentions? 
2 FIFA World Cup is going to be a shit show.
2 Dope news!
2 Honest question, what positive affect of any kind is Russia currently having on the world? I'm sure there's a good answer, I just don't know what it is. Fighting some bad guys or something maybe? I'm trying not to be biased, but it seems like you can't read a news story for a week without hearing Russia doing something awful. 
2 Who's surprised
2 I was watching speedskating yesterday and thinking it must suck to race against Russians. You *know* they are juiced by Putin's orders. 
2 Dope
2 I see your point, and acknowledge the giant rhetorical issue re: what-aboutism. I just had a chuckle about how efficient your comment was at highlighting the lows my country has sunk toward.I do appreciate your calling my comment out. We have adopted as a culture untold numbers of problems in our common discourse. Including, with all due respect, a hypersensitivity to highlight major issues in the face of minor offences.Edit: on second read, did you aim to imply that I'm acting as a Russian troll? Or merely highlighting my rhetorical oversight?
2 Crazy idea, we all know that doping is going to happen anyways. What if we allowed all forms of doping to be legal in sports? Or what if we allowed just a little doping to even the playing field a bit? Like runners are going to use blood doping for example but why not just allow a certain threshold of it, like you are allowed this level of blood cell count or you are allowed to have your hormone levels this high.
2 About the time.
2 the same  year they are hosting the World Cup. Wow.
2 So they have an extra 2 years to figure out how to beat the testing at the 2020 games...
1 This is huge!  NPR was just opining this morning that the IOC would cave to pressure to resist banning them.  Good on them for standing up to the Putin gang.
1 Good. Cheating bastards. 
1 What a bunch of dopes.
1 Now Russian athletes can wear neutral colored uniforms... Just like the Russian soldiers in Ukraine...
1 dope.
1 A better title would be, "All Russian Olympians are now owned by the International Olympic Committee"
1 This has got the be killing Putin. He loves the Olympics. Loves all that testosterone and virility and any chance to kick America's ass.
1 Weren't they banned from summer olympics a few years ago, only to be reinstated a week before they began?
1 The whole country will not be present or just some specific teams?
1 I am very pleased with this announcement. After Russia's rampant cheating in the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they were never adequately punished. They should have been banned from 2016 Summer Olympics, [as was recommended](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2652487-anti-doping-officials-reportedly-will-ask-to-ban-russia-from-2016-rio-olympics), but instead they were allowed to compete. I recommend the Netflix documentary [Icarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXoRdSTrR-4&amp;t=1s), for those who want to know more about Russia's rampant drug abuse and cover up in Sochi Olympics in 2014.
1 Can't wait to see what Trump thinks of this. /s
1 Fuck Russia. Fake ass wannna be America. Can't win without cheating just like their stupid leader
1 Well, this is embarrassing for Russia. 
1 Not really unexpected.
1 But Putin’s cool, right? Maybe there was doping, but he wouldn’t mess with our election, right?
1 What is the practical difference between doping and [TUE](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/therapeutic-use-exemptions)?Will, say amphetamines, taken for ADHD, act differently upon the human organism by the virtue of the bureaucratic procedure done properly?**Bonus question:** how does the performance of athletes from some country A, which prohibits psychostimulants for medical application, should be compared to that of athletes from another country B, which has no such restriction? (ADHD is only the most obvious example, of course).
1 How long until Trump criticizes the IOC?
1 "Come on guys, surely there has been a misunderstanding.  I talked to Putin. He said he is just as surprised at this as me!  SECOND CHANCE."- Donald Trump
1 I understand that that not every government is perfect, but is there a moment when the Russian government isn't shady?
1 Doping and hacking...for Mother Russia.
1 The athletes can still compete if they're invited, it'll just be under the "Olympic" flag instead of the Russian flag.
1 TIL that Russia was able to pass their drug testing by handing athletes jars of piss through a glory hole.
1 Reminds me of the [women's Olympic team] (https://youtu.be/DFgZXL3tL1A) scene from Top Secret
1 TIL I'm not the president of Russia
1 State sponsored doping... Russia is so desperate to appear tough and important that they are willing to stoop this low... it’s one thing to invade a sovereign nation... but to ruin sportsmanship for your own ego and national image is just so sad.
1 Wow that Russian guy that confessed and provided the proof is totally gonna end up dead in an "accident" real soon 
1 Why not come up with a new Olympic, they have the summer, the winter, why not a Doping one, just let who wants to get doped to go to that one.
1 Let's just split into 2 different Olympics- the "Normal Olympics" where no one dopes and the "Enhanced Olympics" where the games are actually fun to watch.  
1 Banned for using a glory hole to swap urine in the testing lab. That's one for the history books!
1 These Olympics are gonna be so boring...
1 Can we ban them from the internet too?
1 How Sad :) Greetings from Poland
1 Let's hope FIFA is next (although the amount of corruption in that organization shows that it probably won't)
1 Clean Russian Athletes are still allowed to compete under the OAR term and under the Olympic Flag
1 Does this mean trump is unable to attend the olympics?
1 This will be the worst olympic hockey tournement ever
1 > Some Russian officials had threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment.This is like how I boycotted so many parties in high school. 
1 Virtually all Olympians are on performance enhancing drugs, Russia are just legitimising it. 
1 If anyone hasn't watched the Netflix original called Icarus. It dives deep into the Russian doping and the way they were able to avoid detection for so long. The Russian who exposed the doping is in protective custody in the States because of the death threats on his life.https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80168079
1 Lol suck it Russia 
1 "Fuck it, lets just cheat and lie about everything" - Russia, apparently. 
1 Putin could let the athletes compete under the IOC flag - but doing so would have to mean admitting Russia cheated so.....
1 Ya do the dope, ya get the nope
1 Can we ban them from the 2018 World Cup too? 
1 Is this a joke? If they ban countries for doping then they should ban everyone. 
1 Somehow, some way, someone is going to blame this on Trump.
1 If Russian athletes are so great, why do they need to use drugs?  
1 This should not even be surprising. Russia ran one of the clearest, craziest, state organized doping programs ever seen. It was through the entire Russian government and used the FSB. It was basically a continuation of the program that the Soviet Union ran
7 The Russians attempting to cheat?  No way
6 This is completely unprecedented.Some athletes will still be allowed to go, they will just have to not use the Russian Flag.I'm glad they're not punishing the athletes, this isn't their fault.I kind of feel bad for the athletes that were pressured into doping too. 
6 They'll be too busy with the US mid-term elections anyway. 
7 incoming tweet from trump denouncing that very unfair treatment
24 Disgusting cheating Russian POS
7 I feel really bad for those athletes in Russia who DIDN'T dope.All that work for nothing.  Sorry comrade.
7 Well deserved. Doesn't matter if you're hosting the Olympics or not, giving your athletes an unfair advantage over those of other countries is never fair.
13 And they are still allowed to host the world Cup. This is just amazing....
5 Netflix has a good documentary on the doping of sports. [Icarus](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079). It isn't limited to Russia, in fact, almost all high-level athletes dope.
5 Sneaky fucking Russians 
3 Russia has become a festering sore on planet earth in the past 5 years, hasn't it?
3 There should be a small steroid and drug section to the Olympics where we see athletes high on tons of chemicals doing inhuman things. Like web-slinging.
2 Will Russia allow the U.S. to compete?
3 Expecting Russian support of North Korean nuclear and missile program during the Olympics because of massive butthurt.
3 Is it me or does Russia have a national 'cheat at everything' mindset?
2 I highly recommend ‘Icarus’ on Netflix. Such a good documentary about unearthing the whole thing. Amazing watch
3 I believe that a country should not be banned as a whole, only athletes that were found to have this doping done to them.
2 I am so over Russia being absolute assholes in everything. 
1 The Olympics died long ago, when they removed the amateur only status and allowed professionals to compete. That right there is the same spirit as doping, a pro going against an amateur; a salary, sponsorship, access to better facilities and trainers than a amateur athlete. Yeah that isn't the case now but back then, it was worse than doping and they allowed it...for what? More money for the IOC and all the corrupt admins and politicians? Of course. So let the athletes dope till their hearts content. It's not about the performance, it's about how much money crosses everyones palms.
1 My condolences to r/the_donald 
5 Canada's time to shine!
8 Putin is not going to be happy about this. 
3 Well, at least they're in the World Cup next year. No one ever cheats at football. Never. 
4 Serves them right 
8 “There were bad people on both sides”. -Probably Trump 
4 Can we ban them from our election?
7 Eat shit Russia
2 Russia's national slogan should be if you ain't cheatin' you ain't trying. These fuckers are trying to leverage themselves in every facet. 
3 “Just saw on Fox & Friends that the Olympics, which are a total disaster    with falling ratings, are pushing a FAKE NEWS doping story which is a total WITCH HUNT!! Therefore, our Russian comrades have decided not to participate in the 2018 Olympics and will instead be visiting Mar a Lago”
3 Putin will not be pleased
5 Bout f’n time.
3 Alright I'm just curious here. How does doping help someone in a glorified sled go faster?Edit: Since this is already getting down voted I feel the need to say I am not supporting Russia at all, I was just genuinely curious. I am THRILLED they were banned as I don't think they should even have been allowed to compete at Rio in any capacity. I want to see elite athletes perform at the limit of the human body-- the true limit, not an artificial, drug created one.
5 Now who is Trump supposed to root for?
2 Trump is going to condemn this on Twitter tomorrow. 
4 First it’s our news the cheat on and now it’s worlds sports! What’s next?!
2 [removed]
4 Can someone explain to me why everything that touches Russia is some kind of sketchy?
4 Oh well, they'll probably compete under the Olympic flag and celebrate every medal as a russian victory.
2 Find it hard to believe Russia is the only country engaging in doping. Seems like they were just the first to be caught.
2 Ought to make Hockey more interesting
2 Trump: Olympics are fake sports. As one of the best, best althetes I know this. US will not compete.
2 Get fucked Russia 
2 Now, how will they blame Hillary for this?
2 Can't wait to hear Donald talk about how this is such an injustice so such a beautiful leader of the most beautiful country. 
2 Holy shit I have such a justice boner now after watching the farce that was the 2016 Olympics. 
2 Wow that's harsh punishment, but fair.
2 Trump will try to pardon them.
2 Russia. Rotten to the core.
2 Watch trump will be against this decision
2 Looks like Russians were caught "red" handed.
2 Trump said he was told by someone that the Russians were not involved in doping - so I guess that means it didn’t happen.
2 Trump is next ;-)
1 Has it actually been proved that the Russians were doping ? Can someone send me a link? 
2 Russia?   Criminals?  Yeah right.
3 Suck it Russia!!! In all seriousness. If the integrity of physical sports is gonna last we NEED to have better human beings playing them.
3 Huh. Participants in a contest get punished for cheating to win said contest. Even if it is difficult to determine the effect cheating had on winning that contest.I see absolutely no parallels between this and the current presidential situation in the United States today. None whatsoever.
2 So how long before our douchebag president has something to say to defend his Papi Putin?
1 This isn't fair since most of the top countries have doping programmes. Natural athletes do not break world records. 
3 Awww. It's so much fun watching Team Canada's hockey team beat them in any round really. I'm going to miss that now.
1 So the Americans are all clean and healthy? Must be vegan diet ;)
1 Here we go. Buckle up.
1 Is this for all of their teams? or is it targeted?
1 >Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniformBeige wins the gold[?](http://i.imgur.com/SWrTZEa.gifv)
1 What does this do to Krusty Burger's gold-medal free burger promotion?
1 Well that was fast.
1 Wow, I just watched the documentary Icarus last night. Very timely.
1 Check out "Icarus" on Netflix, it details many of the things in the report and is an outstanding documentary. I'm not saying that all Olympic athletes are clean but Russia had it coming this time.
1 This again?  Didn’t we just do this 2 years ago and they were ultimately still allowed to participate?
1 In Russia, sports ban YOU!
1 So much for Ovechkin running off.
1 so when they said this year was going to be 1984... i did not think of Los Angeles 1984
1 damn.... this is unprecedented for the IOC, which has always been accused of taking bribes in exchange for meting out slaps on the wrist. I think the entire Olympic movement has been cast under a shadow of doping & chemical enhancement, deservedly so. 
1 I will break you.  
1 cyka blyat
1 That's cold...
1 Sadulaev lost to Snyder both in and out of season
1 I reckon a drug olympics would be way better... viagra sponsors the relay race.. speed the 100 meters  big pharma could finally come out of the shadows  image everyone doped up  be amazing instead of all this guessing and by now the guy testing the piss must be yellowed off
1 But the athletes are still allowed to play?
1 Sigh
1 "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott "The old "You can't fire me , I QUIT!" routine.
1 Again?
1 This is pretty huge news. This isn't some small country, it's a world superpower.
1 this can kickstart the steroids olympics where everyone is on gear all the time 
1 How much of this was the government and how much was the athletes themselves? Like, how coerced were they to do this? Could you just refuse? It would suck if you were an athlete who didn’t dope but you didn’t get to go to the olympics in your prime because everyone else fucked it up for you.
1 I thought there was a typo in the title and thought "what sport"? And then it clicked
1 Shocker 
1 Trump will probably respond by boycotting the olympics to support his buddy.
1 I wonder which criteria will the IOC take to consider Russian athletes to compete under the IOC banner, besides of a verifiable record of being clean of doping substances.
1 I think it's a good call to punish the officials and still give the geniunely hardworking Russian athletes a chance to compete 
1 For a second I thought you meant the football cup, which takes place in Russia
1 In Mother Russia, steroids take you.
1 Russia: the worlds mafia
1 so Rocky IV really was telling the truth
1 Damn commies 
1 Didn't they do this also for the last Olympics, but then end up allowing them like 2 weeks before it started?
1 I feel like they're still going to show up
1 Can't wait til the story breaks that Nike has been doping it's sponsored athletes
1 Damn Somebody messed up
1 WE WILL CREATE SUPER ATHLETE! 
1 I wish we had XTREME OLYMPICS where everyone was doping with the best performance enhancers, that would be far more entertaining imo.
1 Seems like the PR department for *Icarus* showed up. There's no less than 100 comments mentioning how people should watch the documentary. 
1 This isn't very surprising. 
1 This is big new. Huge news. Maybe the biggest in a long time.
1 [deleted]
1 damn, russia, you break all the rules
1 Good. Overdue. They should've been barred from Rio too.
1 Isn't that a coincidence.
1 ...again.
1 [deleted]
1 Again?
1 its weird how slow reddit has gotten with the news. this used to be the place stuff would break first. i heard this story, last night, on public radio
1 I would have been real funny if this happened during Sochi
1 Russia?  Cheating and being deceitful?  No way!  /s
1 Seems like Russia just got in trouble because they found a better way to cheat then everyone else. 
1 Hey /u/DNVR1345,This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
1 The most important part of the story is sportsmen are allowed to participate under olympic flag. It's a win win for russia and russians. Putin suck while sportsmen go to olympic games.
1 Pls Valve do the same
1 This is somehow President Trump's fault. When will he listen?
1 Recommend you guys watch Icarus the documentary about the Russian doping
1 >Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment.Uhhhh, they banned you, you can't boycott...well you CAN I guess but no one is going to notice or care
1 Ducks fly together!
1 Now they will play victim and act like it’s a conspiracy against them. 
1 Everyone else competing at an Olympic level are doping too though..
1 Russia seems to really like bending the rules
1 Trouble is, there are many other places where cheating has gone on.The persistent rumors about electric motor equipped bicycles make me question some riders who made amazing victories only to drop out of the sport entirely.Like a certain Canadian ryder who won a cycling major in Italy.
1 I will PERSONALLY spit in every 50th Krusty Burger!
1 Sports would be so much more entertaining if doping was permitted
1 Is there a year they DON'T get banned for doing drugs?Seems like a real stand up place /s
1 This has certainly put Russia's Olympic hopes on ice. 
1 Dope.
1 Doping? Is that what they call what they did to get Trump elected?
1 they are hardly the only country doping at the olympics. 
1 Anyone who saw Rocky IV should have seen this coming. 
1 Imagine President Putin talking to the athletes before the Olympics, "just make Russia proud, okay?" with a wink and a smile. And they would think "ahh, he means win by all means necessary".After the doping scandal broke Putin yelling at them "THIS IS NOT WHAT I MEANT, YOU KNUCKLEHEADS!"
1 A world without Putin is a world I look forward to. 
1 The Russian track and field teams were also banned, from the Summer Olympics for doping. 
1 how do you even know when someone's doping?
1 that's just fucking stupid IMO
1 Suuuure must be nice for the investigative body to conclude Russian sabotage and the leaders to take their word and punish Russia.  
1 Get ready for a Trump twitter storm about how Hillary dopes and nobody cares.
1 Ok I get it that was kinda stupid but nibba it’s a fucking Winter Olympics smh
1 Title says Russia CHOO CHOO
0 This has clearly a lot to do with politics. 
1 Kim Yuna was robbed of her third olympic gold to some amateur who fell in her final act.  She fell in her final act and still won the gold.Thanks Russia.
1 IOC has always been the beacon of corruption. 
1 That actually kind of solves the NHLs problem, since they’re not allowing their athletes to go (it’s up to each owner to decide if they’ll let their players go) you had a ton of players saying they’ll go anyway, but a lot of those vocal athletes are Russians (Ovi was the biggest name) 
1 Oooh Russia gon be PISSED!
0 Olympics is ass anyways. B rated bum athletes (in the sports that people actually care about. hockey, soccer, etc) 
1 I hope as many of the clean athletes win as possible, just to make Russia not only shamed, but also regretful as the clean athletes can prove to win without resorting to doping. 
1 Would have been funny in Sotchi 4 years ago. 
1 Important note on the athletes:    > Any athletes from Russia who receive special dispensation to compete will do so as individuals wearing a neutral uniform, and the official record books will forever show that Russia won zero medals.
1 Whoa. Damn.
1 I can't wait to see the shitty over-produced Bob Costas voice over video about this.
1 It wont havr ANY repercusions for the 2018 World Cup, becouse FIFA are ball less (no pun intended) corrupt arsehats.. If they wont strip Quatars WC for acctually using fucking slaves to build the stadiums, then why would they stop the WC next year?
1 I see most people are talking about how it is all about money, i guess they also dont want all their players to get injured? But i see how this could mean they are just trying to save money
1 Take that Putin!
1 Good. Cheating is not fair.
1 This is huge unprecedented news 
1 Aww shit they gon war.
1 Put MMA in the Olympics 
1 Gloves off!
1 Seems no one is rushin' to write any dope top comments.
1 When can we build a wall around Russia and consider it a lost cause? I cannot think of one positive thing that’s come from ru in recent history, aside from any efforts to end ISIS that is.
1 Lul
1 Lol
1 No!! How will South Korea get their revenge for figure skating?
1 Is anyone else worried about N. Korea during the Olympics? 
1 The Olympics needs reformed anyway. It has been irrelevant posturing for centuries. Rather than athletes performing specific tasks, it should be athletes performing ALL tasks. There are already specified tournaments to compete nations without 4-year and destination arbitration. Olympics fills no special role in this regard except as a glorified tourist scam rather than public awareness. The IOC is just as corrupt and worthless as any major sports committee.If Olympics aren't going to be held in Greece every 4 years then people need to stop giving a shit and stop appropriating and bastardizing shit for publicity. You don't need the Olympics anymore to know how great or shit a country is.The world is "safer" and interconnected enough in modern days that Olympics no longer serves a purpose. Maybe if the world reverts back into a war-torn shithole we can bring back the Olympics.
1 Is there anything that Russia won't cheat at? 
1 Go watch [Icarus](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt6333060/?ref=m_nv_sr_1)
1 Vlad won't like this. 
1 In reaction Russia banned the US from the World Cup.
1 Lets see, I doubt it will end like this, they will most likely find away out of this. Powerfull people always do
1 Meh, looking at the list of 'approved drug use' for Olympic atheletes made me realize literally everybody is doping.  
1 Oh, so NYT isn't soft-banned now?
1 "to the proud sports juggernaut that has long used the Olympics as a show of global force but was exposed for systematic doping in previously unfathomable ways."Wonder *how* they were doping?
1 What does this say when the entire state supports drug use and they still don't win? Fuck. 
1 Nice job Idiot 
1 This could make for a damn good movie.You have some of the most promising athletes approached by the government for a state-backed doping program.  A bunch of them refuse, lose the trials to the cheaters and their hopes are dashed.  Then at the last minute, Russia gets banned and suddenly all those clean athletes have a second shot at the Olympics.
1 I like how they’re hosting the World Cup this year, that nice.
1 I hate banning the whole delegation;  better to have given lifetime bans for all known cheaters, athletes and coaches alike
1 If they’ll go to such measures for Sport imagine how bad they’re trying to fuck your political system. 
1 Meanwhile the entire Western world is collapsing. 
1 Is doping really cheating if everyone is doing it? 
1 It was only a matter of time for endless years of cheating endorsed by the state. A big kick in the teeth for Putin's pride 😀
1 If only they'd some this before the 2016 election.
1 I mean the IOC and the Olympics have some obvious issues of their own.But holy shit, this is a pretty big deal.
1 "The burning you feel? It is *shame.*"
1 adusk qmaster has u
1 oh snap!
1 Worlds worst superpower country with absolutely no morals banned for athletes who constantly dope.........shocking
1 Russia is just going to stay home and have Sochi games Part II. World record 100% of the medals earned by Russian athletes.
1 Trump's gonna be pissed
1 I know doping is the reason for this ban, but I'm sure the rest of the world (minus Donnie) feels good seeing Russia punished for anything at all after they forced Donald Trump on us all. (As an American, I know I do!)
1 Why is it so hard for them to follow rules? 
1 Misleading. They were banned from representing their nation, which means either a boycott or participating under the neutral IOC flag
1 I mean this is great and a step in the right direction, but I highly doubt Russia is the only country doing this. 
1 People, people. Please be clear that **"clean"**Russian Athletes are **allowed** to compete next year.
1 Okay Putin. Okay. You already shady as fuck. Why should anyone believe you at this point?
1  , 
1 1974 comments and no upvotes??? IT'S A CONSPIRACY.
1 Canada will dominate the games in 2018
1 Good, cheating fucks 
1 This must be humiliating for Russians. 
1 Russia isn't banned from the Olympics for doping, its for various other political reasons, this doping scandal is just a scapegoat.Everybody knows and accepts the fact that doping and competitive sports goes hand in hand yet nobody wants to actually bring that fact into the spotlight or else it'll turn decades of competitive sports into the sham that it actually is.
1 And this is why you don't leave paper trails when doing naughty things
1 Is nooooooooooo
1 I think I’ve seen this article before...
1 will the Russians be able to participate in the 2017-2018 World Juniors?
1 Are we even surprised? We’ve all seen Rocky IV
1 didn't they learn from last time?
1 Russia has an answer: Russian TV will not show Olympics for Russians.
1 Banned as a nation, but the athletes will compete under a fake flag.
1 I wish that the Olympics were somehow legally binding as which countries had political clout over other countries based on the number of medals earned.  And then that this would have happened.
1 They also got banned from IWF this year. Their lifters couldnt compete in Anaheim, CA along with other weightlifting powerhouse countries
1 Collective punishment is not justice.
1 Fun fact: Russian ex-Minister of Sport got promoted in the last year after doping allegations. As a Russian, I wonder what perks our sports officials will get this time and when the award ceremony is going to take place.
1 My question: How prevalent is doping in the Olympics in comparison to Russia? 
1 As they are going to be in South Korea it is highly likely everyone will be banned from them.
1 Why are the Russians always such dick on he international stage? Just play nice and things will get better.
1 "Nobody's talking about how to help Russia." ?? Don't cheat in the first place, comrade.
1 Seriously? That’s terrible...
1 am I missing something, why is it called doping? to steroids get you high in the recreational way
1 Good job putin them in their place IOC.I'll see my self out.
1 Ooooh man. Time to stock up on those McDonald's game pieces!!
1 You did not make it, Viktor. 
1 Great, now there will be an asterisks by the medal count
1 (Nelson voice) "Ha ha!"
1 There probably isn't going to be an Olympics next year.  Tensions on the peninsula are too high.
1 I feel bad for the athletes. Particularly the ones who are clean. I bet the number of nations who dope is jaw dropping. 
1 From host to ghost. 
1 Good. Fuck cheaters. Hope to see similar punishment for China’s use of underage gymnasts as well.
1 SAD! 
1 Maybe they will think twice about not letting Hiliary win an election. 
1 Well, it's about bloody time.
1 So is Pyeongchang Pyongyang's nemesis or something?
1 Being Russian is already doping
1 First off, the Olympics are over, they have been for a very long time.  The reasons are many but the main one being that there is no such thing as an "amateur" athlete any more, certainly not at the Olympic level.Second, maybe I'm just naive but I don't get this whole state sponsored cheating thing.  The only thing I can think of is that to compete with the US, which throws untold amounts of money at their athletes, you have to cheat.  Drugs are cheap in comparison with billion dollar training facilities and personnel.
1 Serves em' right 
1 It's a good thing Russia can't hack the Olympics.*Russia:* "Challenge accepted"
1 This is huge..  Putin cannot stand being a laughing stock..
1 Background knowledge about this from Joe Rogan's podcast with the doping expert that one episode
1 And what about China? 
1 that's right, go fuck yourself Putin 
1 I genuinely feel bad for some of the Russian athletes. It's always easy to say it was their own decision to use banned substances. But in such a corrupt environment it's either cheating or ending your professional career that you have been training for your entire life. But after all the evidence that came out about the state sponsored doping program, this was the only right decision to make for the IOC.
1 RT on suicide watch
1 I wouldn't be surprised to see russian competitors competing for other teams, but stealing the medals in the end.
1 Oh sure, blame the Russians!
1 Trumps not gonna be happy about this. 
1 Cheating fucking bastards
1 it was not worth breaking the rules
1 @tomitensei
1 Muh Russia is finally a real scandal!Now, how do we use this to bring down Trump?
1 I bet Trump tweets about this
1 I can't believe Supreme Leader Trump will let this happen. Surely he will intervene.
1 /circle jerk  everybody does PeD's EVERYBODY! Except americans /sarcasm
1 Will Russia and North Korea have their own Olympics on the other side of the DMZ?
1 I think we all saw this coming 
1 Not a good idea. Do you want Russia to invade Europe? This is how you get Russia to invade Europe.
1 That’s dope!
1 Get these cheaters outa here. 
1 GOOD! SUPERB NEWS! NOW BAN THEM FROM THE INTERNET, THEY CHEAT IN ONLINE GAMES TOO!
1 Am I crazy or did this not happen like three months ago ? 
1 they need to stop PUTIN that dope in their body!(Ha!)
1 Should have made a smaller hole in the wall.
1 Come on someone post a whataboutsim for the USA. Where is the troll farm when you really need them
1 I've got nothing to contribute....Fuck Russia though.
1 Do you want WWIII? Because that's how you get WWIII
1 Hilarious, but let's be real -- theyre all doping. Most just aren't so stupid as to make it a national project to juice up.
1 I bet Gary Bettman is behind this.
1 Thanks God, fuck you Russia, you already pissed off the whole world, if you think that changing doping-positive test is fucked up, than google about how this fuckers changed doping-negative test into doping-positive test for Ukraine biathlon team.
1 sorry, what is doping?
1 Yay Kenya beat Russia in the 2018 winter olympics. Good job Kenya
1 What's doping?
1 Great, now let's talk about the score inflation in the woman's figure skating competition. Adelina Sotnikova did not deserve the scores she was given. Her scores were inflated to push her past Kim Yuna, who deserved the gold medal. Yes, Sotnikova skated beautifully but no way in hell was enough to beat Yuna. One of the judges was Alla Shekhovtseva who is wife of general director of the Russian Skating Federation Valentin Piseev. Conflict of interest much? Additionally and I'm quoting from an article:>Also on the panel is a Ukrainian man named Yuri Balkov. Balkov was suspended from judging for a year after trying to fix the Nagano ice dancing competition and reportedly has ties to Moscow. "The two other new long program judges were from Estonia and France, which was the country that conspired with Russia to try to fix the pairs and ice dancing competition at the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City,"   It's really sad that this was not investigated further. 
1 Seems like the only thing thats been banned is the Russian flag! sniff sniff, god there's a smell of fried chicken around here.
1 Meanwhile, Russia fucking yawned.
1 > “Everyone is talking about how to punish Russia, but no one is talking about how to help Russia,” Mr. Smirnov said, sipping a hot beverage in the lobby of the Lausanne Palace Hotel before delivering his final appeal to officials that afternoon.
1 This should make things easier for the US Hockey Team
1 In Russia, Olympics ban you. 
1 Yet we’re playing football there next year?!
1 In Russia, dope use you
1 Pretty ballsy holding the Olympics in South Korea with all the tension on the region
1 Ovechkin is on suicide watch.
1 Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
1 For a good documentary on Doping Watch "Icarus" it's on Netflix and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. 
1 Isn’t Russia really probe to doping? Could have sworn last Olympics both they and Britain had massive issues with their people being on superdrugs
1 poor athletes
1 "we didn't wanna go anyway. South Korea is second best Korea." Russia probably.
1 If anyone wants to watch a good documentary leading up to how some of the Russian doping was uncovered check out Icarus on Netflix.Edit: not on HBO
1 Russia should make their own olympics were everyone’s doped up as much as possible, to see how far the human body can possibly go. I’d watch it...
1 Good, they have zero respect for olympic games.
1 They will be reinstated before the olympics. 
1 I feel bad for the young Russian athletes who have been training their whole lives for this.  It’s not their fault. 
1 How corrupt do you have to be to get banned by the IOC, a bunch of corrupted fat cats?It's like if Roy Moore tells you, dang that girl is too young, man.
1 Icarus is wonderfully illuminating on this subject for those that are interested. 
1 Didn't this happen last time... Then right before the Olympics started they were allowed...
1 Ha, we're going to dominate even more than usual now. It's good being America.
1 Honestly, I think almost all competitive sports where people play for country need to go. Teams go fucking nuts trying to win. Everybody that can get away with doping will dope. 
1 Whole lotta people about to "fall" out windows. 
1 That's pretty dope
1 *too dope for the Olympics*
1 How about banning them from 2016 elections
1 And the gold medal for ice hockey goes to....Sweden !
1 xd
1 What did they think would happen when they cheated in the previous Olympics?
1 Russian doping? Not another Trump-Russia article! Trump is Russia's dope.
1 This is going to make it an asterisk Olympics, and certainly isn't something the host country wanted to see. 
1 Honestly they should just drop all antidoping rules. Professional sport is no longer about promoting health and exercising, but about doing anything to break yet another record. It's one big doping race where people who take better, newer and harder to detect helpers win.I don't believe you can be world champion nowadays without any kind of artificial boosters to your performance. 
1 What about the rest of the people who are on PED's?
1 BLARRRRMPF HAS SOMETHUBG TO FO WITH THIS BLUKKKRRTDRUMPFGFGFFGGF
1 Haha.
1 Russia is synonymous with corruption.
1 They should allow athletes not caught to participate under Olympic or independent flag.Some of them have no choice and allowing them to perform would be in Olympics spirit.
1 On the other hand, now they can fully focus on some new antics during Olympics while rest of the world has attention on Olympics.
1 Quelle suprise!
1 Trumps got this
1 As an outsider, the whole concept of doping in competitions is so weird to me. Like if I won some physical competition with the help of that stuff, I wouldn't feel accomplished. I would just feel like the drugs gave me the win.
1 If I'm understanding that last paragraph correctly... Is FIFA just ignoring the fact that almost all Russian athletes were using steroids in the Olympics, and letting a Russian team play without investigating?
1 Good riddance. Buncha juice heads
1 *Russia* doped?As in "we survived Operation Barbarossa in large part due to our superior Winter survivability" Russia?Russia, which has Siberia as its backyard?Russia?Come on, Russia, you don't need the dope! Geez...
1 Juicy Sluts 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
1 Didn't they do the same thing in Rio, and than lifted the majority of the bans a couple weeks before?
1 This is how WWIII starts. 
1 Didn't they have some sort of doping allegations last year? So much has happened I can't remember.
1 Inb4 Trump "what our corrupt Olympics committee has done, is terrible. People tell me, they tell me all the time, alot of people are saying, this committee is a disgrace. What they've done to Russia is the result of a witchhunt." 
1 Krustyburger is the meat flavored sandwhich of the 2018 Olympics. Just scratch the game space on your card and if the US wins a gold medal you get a free Krustyburger!
1 Olympics is going to be boring, I want to see chemically enhanced super humans competing against each other, that would be cool.
1 +/u/User_Simulator /u/randoh12
1 Theres a good documentary on this 
1 A Canadian Olympic judge tried to whistleblow corruption at the judging level and what she got for it was being suspended instead ([Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/canadian-judge-withdraws-appeal/article954280/)). >Although she has spoken out during the past two years about the irregularities of dance judging -- the deal making, the gift giving and the predetermined results -- things seem to be moving backward....>She was suspended for six months after she secretly taped a telephone conversation with Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was heard to rattle off the placements of skaters before the Olympic dance event was over. Balkov was suspended for one year, but Senft was surprised to find that she was set down, as well....>First, Senft was cited with national bias at the Nagano Olympics after speaking out about judging problems reported in The Globe and Mail in the fall of 1997. Eventually, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned the ISU ruling. The ISU suspended Senft for misconduct after she brought forward the Balkov tape at the Court of Arbitration hearing.This is the Olympics for you. Try to expose corruption with actual evidence and you get suspended for misconduct instead.
1 The whole country? 
1 Am I the only one that's super interested in how they got those caps off?The ring's probably not magnetic, I would guess that they've thought of that.Its probably conductive though. The could have used induction to push it up?Or maybe they put the bottle in a vacuum chamber, then released the vacuum, thus causing the ring to pop up towards the low pressure area around the mouth of the bottle?Interesting stuff.
1 At least they'll save some cash... The Olympics seems more and more like the World Cup these days. A bit of a [waste of money for most countries involved](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140221-olympics-sochi-rio-de-janeiro-london-boris-johnson-montreal-athens-world/), most of whom could better us that money to improve everyday issues at home.It often seems even worse normally for the host nation. Obviously that's just my opinion, but when I see the sate of the situation with the Qatar World Cup it's hard for me not to be cynical.
1 Krustyburgers are on me in 2018!
1 Again?
1 Isn't everyone doping though?
1 In Russia, Olympics play you. 
1 I'm sure they're telling the truth when they say that this is a lie. /S
1 Let's see how long this lasts 
1 Dumb!Stupid!Crazy!Dangerous! Stinks!In one word would I use dope? NOPE!These kids are right, drugs will hurt your mind, body, and life. Hi I’m Brandon Tartakoff , chairman of NBC. I’ve got a hit idea for the new Fall Season- “Don’t use drugs” THERES NO HOPE WITH DOPE!!! *Saved By the Bell theme cues*
1 In Mother Russia, Olympics boycott you.
1 The alternative 2018 Winter Olympics have been confirmed, location: Mar-A-Lago.
1 Wow, I'm not too educated on this overall, but the WHOLE country? I feel like most of them weren't doping?? Like especially hockey, those are NHL players.
1 lol
1 Wonder if the other doping countries are going to think "*OH SHIT we should stop doping*" or "*OH SHIT we should hide our doping better*".
1 Wasn't this announced a few weeks ago?
1 In Soviet Russia, Winners DO USE drugs.
1 And you know how people on russian website pikabu(it's like 9gag) responded? Posted tons of memes with Kim Jong-Un and #norussianogames
1 everyone needs to watch icarus
1 Ha serve them right! 
1 It's Rocky IV all over again.
1 An independent team of players winning Silver in Ice Hockey. I say silver because USA!!!! Kinda sucks for Ovi and other Russian NHL players. But Actually weren't they not going anyway?
1 Damn
1 Dope.. 
1 Oof
1 4D chess by Russia.  Won't have to concern themselves with evacuating any of their athletes or citizens from SK when NK lights the torch.
1 I take back what I said about the IOC being too cowardly to do anything 
1 So I’m to assume that the Russian government is also facilitating steroid use for handicapped athletes? They refused to recertify before the Paralympic  games. 
1 Krusty personally stands to lose 44 million dollars.
1 Icarus on Netflix, if you haven't watched already. Should have been the summer Olympics, too. 
1 Makes you wonder, if they're willing to cheat for the Winter Olympics they'd be willing to cheat for the World Cup. Which is easily more popular 
1 MAMA ZARYA AINT HAPPY!!!
1 Any bets Russia forces North Korea to attack South Korea during the Winter Olympics?
1 Isn't that what they did with the US elections?
1 Prepare you to a Russian media revenge.
1 The old passing pee through a hole in the wall trick.  Classic Ivan.
1 dammit, they had some of the hottest curling teams each year. 
1 Drink drank drunk and no sport!
1 I'm just copying a random idea I saw one time, but we should have olympics where doping is necessary to participate. I wanna see how much further science can take the human body.
1 this is the "you cant fire me i quit logic" lol
1 It's funny Russia cheating in the Olympics is the reason Olympians are professional athletes today
1 Are anabolic steroids legal in Russia ?
1 Fucking assholes. Feel bad for the athletes that didn't dope, though 
1 Is this decision final or can Russia still appeal and end up where we started? I hope Russia got what they deserved
1 That's dope
1  Russians are DOPE !!
1 Dope.
1 I was wondering if this was gonna hit the front plate
1 Очень жаль. Только печаль вызывает, больше никаких эмоций
1 DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?!?!?
1 HAHAHAHAHA SERVES YOU RIGHT, FUCKERS.
1 Woah
1 Wait... aren't they the ones who hacked a database and gave out a bunch of legitimant medical information? Like athletes that had to take ADHD meds, and painkillers? What losers. 
1 SAD. Very very bad peole. PITIN is a nasty woman.
1 They were already banned for Rio... until they were unbanned a few days before the start. Let's see if this time it actually sticks.
1 Right decision!
1 "Some Russian officials had threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment."..."The country’s government officials are forbidden to attend"
1 Collective punishment
1 Russia cheats.  Shock.
1 What do you define as "state sponsored"....all of the coaches, athletes, trainers, doctors know what's going on
1 Again. Lol
1 WAAA WAAA WAAAAAH
1 What about the world cup these druggies are hosting it 
1 If I was Russian, and seriously in contention for a Gold medal at the Olympics, I'd be thinking about defecting.
1 Cyka Blyat
1 ...the US
1 Good shit. It’s a damn shame that all the legit athletes have to suffer for the governments systemic cheating. 
1 I would want to go anywhere near North Korea. The games are being held so close to the border I’d be happy if I were Russia. 
1 What’s doping?
1 i too am not in the olympics because of smoking dope
1 10-8 round to WADA
1 This will make Hockey much more interesting!
1 good.. fuk em
1 How would one prove that they are clean? 
1 Holy smokes. No Addidas wearing Gopniks 
1 Why the fuck would you do steroids to go skiing?
1 Cry me a river.  The blow back version.
1 What is doping? Is it like steroid use? 
1 Thank you, Russia, for doing everything in your power to give the world a state-level movie blockbuster villain again.  You're making Ivan Drago proud.
1 Kept reading duping instead of doping. They gotta farm like the rest of us. 
1 Nice hammer ban on Russia.
1 I would consider this punishment to be quite light considering that they knew the Russians were cheating before the olympics in Rio and in my opinion should've been banned completely from them
1 [THE POWER!!!](/moreintense)
1 I'm genuinely surprised. I'm very pleased, but also surprised. I didn't actually expect the IOC to give that much of a shit.
1 Aren't they hosting the 2018 world cup for soccer? LOL, they are going to be so doped up
1 It will only breed more hate within Russia. And trust me, Putin won't be the target of that hate.
1 Wow after years of then doping they finally banned them. Now the only thing I want from this is Olympics is real NHL players playing hockey
1 It is Possible the WADA picks up the ban and Russia is banned from their own World Cup. If you go by goal differential, Italy would be back in place of the hosts.
1 Wtf russia why you gotta cheat ??
1 Wow, that’s dope.
1 Finally 
1 I have got a bad feeling about this Winter Olympics, the tension with DPRK, Russia's ban... If China protests and boycotts the Olympics I will be very concerned about the safety of everyone on that peninsula. I hope I am wrong, but I can't shake this feeling something bad will happen. 
1 Try colluding your way out of that one, Putin!
1 An someone give me context? I'm not a big follower of sports. Who doped and who find out?
1 Lol
1 They're just going to make their own Olympics, with blackjack and hookers.
1 Blyat
1 YAAAAAAAAS! finally a real penalty for a country that strives to cheat and rig almost everything it does.  What an embarrassment for Putin who thinks he can get away with rigging the world. 
1 Ha, classic Russia. 
1 Ivan Drago fucked it up for everyone
1 Putin’s Russia
1 That’s dope man!
1 I read somewhere that they are all at it...not just Russia...but russia more than most....this is more about politics than really trying tp clean house.
1 Capitalist pigs don’t know soviets have thrice the amount of testosterone.
1 Never saw this coming...............,. 
1 That's dope. I mean ... that ... I don't know what I mean.
1 Man Russia cheats in everything. Vidya & real sports. 
1 Thumbs up for The Olympic Committee. The Russians have to learn that the international society doesn't accept their way of behavior. But will they ever? That's the question.
1 And all because one man lied...
1 I am not surprised nothing has changed since the Soviet times.
1 yeah right
1 Ask Zwerl lol
1 Ban russian oil and gas! Stop feeding bloody Russia. Olimpic ban is just a false flag.
1 Putin could offer them money to get big Russia tattoos or dye their hair red, white and blue or something.
1 Make a separate doping Olympics in the F1/Nascar spirit. Athletes compete for a pharmaceutical company and they work to fine tune the athlete with drugs and medical enhancements. 
1 This is such bull shit i  love their hockey team...): 
1 China? 
1 Democracy and Truth lost January 20th, 2017, Corporations, Racists, and Russia won...
1 politics
1 Russians banned from next Olympics for cheating in the last one.Next: Russians banned from next US election for cheating in the last one? 
1 They'll just get let back in right before it happens like 2016
1 /r/ohlympics is going to suffer the most out of everyone.
2 But all the other countries which using doping isn't banned? 
2 Just close it down for 10 years or so
1 Question as to why this merited a banning of the whole country. I understand that it was a national doping program and I get they deserve the ban. But isn't it an open secret that nations like China do it too? Guess my question is why ban Russia but allow others why is their program worse? I don't have an opinion just asking before I get called a Putin bot.
1 This is dumb. Everyone dopes, to single one country out is ridiculous 
1 The clean Russians need to go out in full force not boycott and dominate. It's the only way to preserve their honor. 
0 Everyone should watch the documentary Icarus. One of Russia's biggest whistleblowers(and a courageous man) is currently living in the US under witness protection. He is the mastermind behind the Russian doping scandal and came clean. If you want to understand the details of how deep their operation is watch the documentary.Oh, and by the way the head of the Olympic doping agency for the US estimates that 50% of US Olympic athletes are doping illegally. 
1 Alright let's everyone's favorite game: "PREDICT. THE PRESIDENT'S. TWEET!"  Rules are simple: give your response in the form of 240 character or less and remember all answers must contain the words "fake news."  Go!
1 trump is sad
1 Good God DAMN, that's article's tone is harsh. I mean, yes, this is news, but the conveyance of shaming is ridiculously over the top.
1 I'm russian. Funny that westerners don't feel being manipulated and  believe in this.
1 ITT: people who genuinely believe Russia is the only country to help with athletes doping. Amazing, how you get to that level of delusion is a real accomplishment. Russia are total hacks and it's great they are being truly punished, but don't be so damned stupid to think it's just them. This is global. 
1 I’m in Mexico right now at a European resort filled with Russians wearing pro trump clothes. Fail.
1 Yeah, doping athletes isn’t the best choice to make when trying to compete in Winter Olympics...
1 Russian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral competitors though. 
1 Good. Cheaters in the Olympics should be banned for life and nations that cheat systematically must be penalized. I'm glad to see that athletes who can prove they are clean can still compete.
1 Over/under Trump pulls our athletes as a protest?
1 They tested positive for Trump. The worst kind of dope in Russia. 
1 Russia is being pushed out of the Olympics being held in a held in a country allied with the USA. I swear this is just like Twilight Struggle, hopeful without nuclear war.
1 Do people still care about the Olympics after the literal shit show in Brazil?  Wasn't that the tipping point for people to be like, 'you know, maybe it's a little crazy to have cities build multi-billion dollar athletic facilities that they're only going to use for a month.'
1 Better allow ALL THE DOPING and see the full potential of the human body and human ingenuity combined. Of course there should be an "if a participant dies or is significantly injured during or, a considerable amount of time, after the olympics, the participant shall be disqualified and return the medals to the next winner"-clause
1 Can Russia stop cheating at everything?
0 Hopefully we'll see total embargo of Russia in my lifetime. They are an empire of evil
1 Who would have thought the IOC has more integrity than the U.S. government in relation to dealing with Russia?
2 Russians and all the countries need to get rid of that murderer Putin. They deserve way better than this. Never forget the victims of the 1999 apartment bombings and the phony Second Chechen war. 
1 No. Russia got banned for annexing crimea and not playing ball with the west. Everyone, including the IOC, has known that russia, china and almost everyone else dopes and cheats. Russia got banned because it's a convenient and easy punishment to ban them from the winter olympics since they aren't hosting it. If russian doping is really the concern, fifa would be removing russia as host of the world cup... So it isn't doping that is a concern. It's just an easy symbolic political punishment for russia. 
1 There should be an Olympics where doping is allowed. We would see fantastic athletic feats.
1 Anyway. I hope Putin dies.
1 Ha!  See ya.
1 Trump:  Putin told me they don't dope their athletes.  I believe him.
1 this book report reads like propaganda.... it may be true... but it still reads like CNN wrote it on their MacBook Pro's at Starbucks in Down town Seattle while browsing the "used clothing" bins on Offer Up.  Dont hate cause it reads like that.... "Show of force using the olympics..." i mean COME ON
1 So how long until Trump tweets his opposition to this?
1 Good, fuck them
1 95% of professional athletes dope.  Such a shame that everyone doesnt see this because sport organizations try and hide this dirty secret from the general population to maintain a virtuous optic.  Everyone dopes
1 Countdown till Trump defends them, 3..2...
1 Anyone who thinks the Russians are the only ones cheating the Olympics is adorable
1 And Trump believes Putin when he says "I didnt do it".. ok.
1 Can we ban Russian-sponsored dopes from our government next?
1 Fuck you, Russian oligarchs.So tired of all your shit. Sincerely, America Edit: Hating on the corrupt, murderous people in charge, not the innocent Russian people. You guys have it way worse than most Americans
1 #СУКА БЛЯДЬ !
1 Now if we could ban them from influencing our elections that would be great.
1 Fuck you and your cheating athletes. Just like the Nazi's did. 
1 Is anyone else annoyed they used the word "doping"?
1 Can we just scrap the Olympics entirely for a decade or two? It's an enormous waste of everyone's money (especially TAXPAYER money,) in a time when no one has money to spare.
1 For athletes that are clean they will still be able to participate as olympians from Russia. Good move, get the cheaters from ruining someone else’s chance on the podium. NPR said 11 of past gold medals Russia won from 2014 olympics were disqualified.
1 That's disappointing, the ol' USA vs Russia rivalry was what made the Olympics fun :/
1 I feel bad for South Korea. It's not going to be a great Olympics for viewership.
-28 Not for doping. For getting *caught* doping. I assure you, more teams are guilty.
1 Why do you people even care about the Olympics? It's been nothing but a medium for corruption for decades now.We should certainly admire and respect the hard work the athletes do, but they tend to do things other than just the olympics. Let the olympics die, or it will continue to be a force of evil.
-1 Now let’s see Trump pull out if Russia isn’t allowed to compete.
-19 Lol at all the mindless Russia hate ITT. It's sad how easily war propaganda works. 
0 Can the IOC ban Russia from future US elections too?
0 [deleted]
-52 So basically a political move instead of an ethical one because we all know it's not only Russia's representatives who dope.
-2 Russia should have their own Olympics and embrace doping.  I certainly don't care what someone else does for money and there are so many athletes cheating anyway.  
-4 [deleted]
1 Sure. I guess it's not worth watching. Oh well.
1 this makes no fcking sense, might as well cancel the olympics and ban every country from competing, as people have already said, EVERY COUNTRY has athletes doping on an Amateur to proffessional to olympic levels...Go whatch the 'Icarus' documentary...
1 Like the other countries are 100% clean... the hypocrisy is unbelievable.they should stop testing altogether because everyone is on something.
0 Calling it now Russia will be in the 2018 Winter Olympics 
-9 Nice propaganda by the USA. No one will ever think that America do the same. So annoying.
-6 The use of a label to hide the title is really inappropriate 
-5 So you can't dope to get an edge, but you can send men posing as women to compete against women? Adds up... 
-13 Lol Winter Olympics will be garbage lmao. No NHL, no Russia. Who's going to watch this shit?
-30 Everyone at the Olympics dopes, I guess they want to reduce the viewership of the event by banning Russia.
-6 And the US has no history of dopers? Hypocrisy is thy name. 
-1 So this is punishment for their doping scheme in 2014?  That seems unfair.  Have the Russians been caught cheating again recently, or did I miss something?  
-1 Here comes the least popular Winter Olympics in years.
-1 Are we gonna ban everyone then? I think it's totally ignorant to think that doping is not a major part of all sports. Everywhere. Russia just got caught this time. Never forget Lance. 
1 Ha Ha. Americans making fun of the russian cheaters, when the americans are the real cheaters. It is absolutely clear that an athlete that has a million dollar sponsorship and a team of 20 people taking care of him has a tremendous advantage over athletes coming from poor countries, who receive just a small salary from the government and don't even have any coaches.When only amateur athletes were allowed to compete on the Olympics, there were some fairness. Now it is ruined. It is just a money show off.Why the USA don't pay to the Olympic committee a lot of cash to buy advantage to its athletes, like in all video games nowadays.The truth hurts, doesn't it?    
1 Yeah like Russia is the only country with doping athletes, right?
-18 wut bout murican roids?
0 Eh, I'll believe it when I see it. I'd be willing to put a few bucks on seeing Russia there on opening night. This is just the IOC showing off that they're 'serious' about doping, but they know the winter Oylmpics are already in trouble and keeping the Russians out will only make things worse. 
-1 And they're hosting the World Cup in 2018, yikes
0 Good. Russia needs to recognize that while there are no laws, per se, governing the international community, there can certainly be backlash for consistent bullshit behavior. This even applies when you're a country with an incredible arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
1 Oh wow, they actually did it....wtf RussiaEdit: I'm talking about the banning, not the doping.
0 How much of this was the government and how much was the athletes themselves? Like, how coerced were they to do this? Could you just refuse? It would suck if you were an athlete who didn’t dope but you didn’t get to go to the olympics in your prime because everyone else fucked it up for you.
0 tl;dr, Russia used steroids
0 They were just too dope. 
0 Putin doesn't believe the rules apply to himself.
0 Man, they really love influencing any event for their own gain. 
0 What are the odds that Trump comes out tweeting about how the “failing IOC won’t let Russia compete! Sad!” ?
0 So? They still compete anyway..
0 I guess we'll see a lot of people with tracksuits then.
0 Vladimir Putin cheat? Shocking!
0 I feel bad for all the athletes who didnt cheat. 
0 Does drinking vodka do give them any sort of advantage though
0 and then the Russian athletes will still march in bearing their flag and win more medals than the USA
0 Is there any way in which Russia *isn't* a massive piece of shit?
0 And the other countries? 
0 * for getting caught. If you think everyone isn't doing it you're naïve. 
0 HEY. IF YOU AINT CHEATING YOU AINT TRYING. That's what my dad used to say.
0 Can't they get their man Jared Kushner on that shit?
0 Am I the only one who thinks that doping actually enriches sport? I get that it is important to create and maintain a level playing field but since there is no difference in principle  between doping and other training methods this could easily be achieved by legalizing all enhancements for everybody instead of arbitrarily drawing the line somewhere. 
0 Although I find this great, I still think it would be even better if the IOC would come to their senses and just divide the Olympic games in two; one for athletes sans steroids, and one for athletes with. Just remove the stigma and let the mad doctors got nuts. Personally, I'd only watch the roided games, since I've always thought it would be magnificent to see athletes spontaneously self-combust right after the 100m sprint. 
0 I bet Trump sends an angry Tweet about this in the next 24 hrs.
0 Olympics is no better than fifa.  Works on bribes and scandals.  At one point it was worth it to watch.  Now you can only watch what they want you to watch.  It’s meh.  No interest in it whatsoever.  
-1 Yet the 1936 olympics were held in Nazi Germany. Seems legit
0 Norway's asthmatic skiers? Who cares.  Russian Presidential elections in 2018? Gotta ban the cheaters!
0 serious question. Every elite athlete does doping and steroids. Russia was just blatant about it. What's the big deal? 
0 My 2018 medal predictions:America: 90% of gold medalsAustralia: The rest of them, all swimmingChina: Silver and bronze medals in gymnastics and synchronized swimming.Iceland:  Gets first bronze medal
0 Lawl
0 Man they cheated hard as fuck... working for a builder exposed me to Russians in America and holy fucking shit they will lie to you straight to your face about everything!!!! Also it’s the same thing with Asians/Indians always lying about income and job history and what not constantly.. no surprise Russia dopes that hard I mean after dealing with them here I almost never believed anything any of them would say because it ended up being a lie every time.. indians and Asians aren’t as bad but it’s still crazy how blatant normal people will lie about shit like your not going to fact check.. I’m sorry but it just doesn’t happen NEARLY as much with black/white people and honestly if your American you usually don’t pull shit like this even if your a Russian/Asian/Indian American it’s the ones that just move here..Also a lot of people would be surprised how many Foreigners on work visas will come to Ameica on work visas and work for a 2-3 months and then just collect unemployment for the entire rest of the year. I know this shit sounds crazy but I’ve ducking seen it multiple times it’s depressing as fuck 
0 Good, they are only good at cheating.
0 They should just allow doping in the Olympics and get it over with. 
0 Wow, so Russia is going to be banned from an event that's taking place in South Korea, while Trump is still president.  If life was a movie, then I would be confident about when shit is gonna finally go down.
0 HOLY COW.  There is a god.
0 Fuck Russia as an entity
0 Nice to see there's at least one organisation out there that's had enough of Russia's shit.Though it's a sad state of affairs when even the IOC has more integrity than the United States.
0 Anyone else picturing Putin in a tracksuit going around pressuring world class athletes to do drugs? 
0 get fucked. well deserved
0 “Everyone is talking about how to punish Russia, but no one is talking about how to help Russia”This might actually be true, so let me be the first to change that. Here is a very comprehensive way to not be banned from future Olympics: Stop doping, and you won't get banned. You're welcome, Russia!
0 its 2017. no one gives a fk about the olympics
0 Almost every athlete from every country uses some form of PEDs, it's naive to think they don't. I'm not saying Russia doesn't, but it's naive to think the US has a halo around it and strictly abides by the rules.This is political. Everyone upset about Russia hacking an election, even though every country meddles in each others affairs.
0 Fair enough. But I firmly believe China and the U.S.A. are doing the same shit or at least something worth proper consequences. The Olympics are way to prestigious for leaving everything to “May the best win” 
1 MAGA! By disqualifying da Russians!
1 How long until Snowden will be exchanged for Rodchenkov...
1 Fuck yes. After watching that Netflix doping documentary I was pretty disheartened that nothing was being done. This is the sweetest justice porn 
1 Russia still allowed to meddle in US elections, though
1 This is just dumb. All of them are doping. 
1 Trump is gonna be so mad. Shall we start taking bets when and what trump will say..Winter Olympics ratings lowest in history! SAD!.
1 TFW ur Russian and you don't know how to feel.
1 Expect Putin to ramp up North Korea meddling.
1 That's kinda sad. Being a Russian and not caring much about Olympics (or sport in general for that matter), I feel like this is going to prove Putin's point about West being an enemy and willing to destroy Russia, so Russia better put whose capitalists to nuclear ashes. Can't really see good side here...
1 I feel bad for the Russian athletes who are actually trying things the right way and they don't get a chance to shine.
1 welp. there's hockey gold for canada. maybe. pretty sure i remember reading something about non-nhl players only this time.
1 The Donald Trump strategy, let's see if it pays off. 
1 No NHL, russians banned. #PlugOlympics2018 *Get hype!*
1 Like they are the only ones... high-profile sport competition is such a BS.
1 Making a dope president is called doping now?
1 that should give them plenty of time to properly rig the US elections next time.
1 **LMAAOOOOOOOOOOO**
1 If they said, that Russian officials, somehow swapped tests containers...then why did Rodchinkov needed to create new super-drooper dopings and make cocktails to hide it? They could just use any dopping and swap tests.It he created a cool doping, which no one test can detect, then what for do they need to swap containers?Any logic? No, for sure.
1 Good. Won't miss them.
1 I wonder how many nations have doping programs that Russia took the hit for. Steroids are a massive problem in sports, and Russia and China aren't the only countries with programs I'm sure.
1 They all dope. Some just get caught. Sad but true.
1 When it was Lance everyone on reddit was “Everyone is on drugs. 100%”. When boot retired without failing tests reddit said “He’s dirty, just too good to be caught but despite not being caught if you say he’s clean you are a fool.” Now again with Russia reddit seem to think doping is bad and should be punished.Hmmm...
1 Вы там в край ахуели пидорасы?
1 they didn't get the newest drug to avoid detection?
1 I read somewhere that they are all at it...not just Russia...but russia more than most....this is more about politics than really trying to clean house.
1 The Olympics are gay. 
-6 When you're too cool to take part in some nerd game, like chill dudes i know I'm dope but you can't kick me out over it😎
-5 As always. Someone big has profit - scandals comes. As it was with Michael Jackson, this Olympics, many other cases were started and more yet to start. It's slander. Shame that politics affect sports. And shame that young kids now here will not want to go and do sports and kids older will not have a chabce to participate and make their dreams come true. Ready to take that downvotes from superior americans as stupid russian alcoholic like media told you we look like. I do nort deny that some atheletes had used forbidden drugs, they should be suspended. But this is just ridiculous. Im curios though why athletes from other countries didnt get banned, the athletes that train with Russian ones and have same coaches as them. 21st century Cold War. 
-2 Woah that's huge!
-1 Need to move indoor volleyball to the winter games
-2 Im sure russia will get donny to pull a few strings. 
-9 Great. Olympic games are a big waste of taxpayers' money and a source of corruption. Can we make this ban permanent please?

-4 But they can still hold the World Cup, huh?
-7 Politics pushing it's way into sports... when the Olympics are meant to unite people. How can anyone see this bullshit ruling against a whole team as remotely fair? It's like banning any american from bike races because of Armstrong...
-7 This is dumb. "Doping" should be not only allowed, but encouraged. Exercise is just as "artificial" as performance enhancing drugs are; why shouldn't people be allowed to do whatever they want to reach peak performance? If it were allowed, it could massively push research into human improvement forward. It's not even like people are on an even footing without doping; not having it just puts the difference onto winning the genetic lottery.It could alternatively be handled like glitches in speedruns, where you have a separate category for baseline humans (akin to the glitchless category of speedruns), but where the main category (usually) is the one where people are allowed to actually try. But the variant where doping is allowed should always be the main one, as this provides incentive into research into improving mankind.
-4 But who is Trump gonna root for now?
-2 Instead of doing the right thing and legalize substances that boost athletes performance which would make the games way nicer to watch by the audience the solution was to ban Russia. 
-2 ONLY Russia??? So we're just gonna let Jamaica continue to cheat the system? Are you telling me Usain Bolt's 9.58s 100m is legit?!?For years people admittedly loaded on steroids could barely break 10 seconds. Then someone comes along and runs 9.5Xs and nobody is questioning this? That's hilarious. How about the fact that the Jamaican women have swept the medals at the Olympics with a bunch of no name sprinters. Not suspicious at all is it? Just gold old fashioned training and hard work. The IOC is a joke
1 Like the US doesn't dope. [The Williams sisters took DOPE](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/13/wada-russian-cyber-attack-espionage-group).Simone Biles took amphetamines. Of course it was leaked by the Russians because of course it is. There are countless countries that don't give a step below heroin and meth to athletes.
1 meanwhile, the much better financed and succesful doping conspiracies run by countries like Norway, UK, Canada, USA, China, etc. will be out in full force, juiced to the gills and producing performances that are physically impossible without PEDs.
-4 So they still get to compete, just as "Olympic Athletes from Russia." So how is this a ban? 
-5 If you think the Russians are the only ones doping then you are naive. Russia has not been a dominant force at the Olympics since the Soviet Union.So Russian athletes take doping, train as hard as everyone else and does the same exercises as everyone else, yet gets beaten athletes from other countries who do not use doping. This is the Lance Armstrong case all over again. Everyone is using doping, and this is just a symbolic gesture by the IOC.    
-3 Disgusting NYT commie globalist political bullshit propaganda to further isolate glorious Russia.. Ironically, its the biggest fucking country in the world, so guess how many shits based Russia gives, if the rest of the commie cultural marxist planet isolates itself. lmao
1 This is stupid, and most people in this thread are as well.Everyone is so progressive and for the legalization of drugs and the end of the war on them, but yet elite athletes using science to their advantage is somehow the worst thing in the world. Like using HGH is less safe than Olympic level skiing. Give me a break. Athletes will destroy their bodies for sport with drugs or not.And then the Russia conspiracy theorists. Great. How about the US gets banned too for damaging permanently the lives of their best women by covering up sex abuse? The US put nearly worthless medals they don't earn personally over the wellbeing of citizens. Fuck right off everyone.The Olympics are about diplomacy through sports as far as countries are concerned. It's not about winning medals. The athletes individual or as a defined team earn them. They are the only people the competition is meaningful. Banning countries for stupid things will just lead to war and human suffering.
-1 Good. Fucking cheaters.
-1 Eat a dick Putin
-1 So, no Russian figure skaters? Big break for the other teams. My Russian-American wife will be sad though.I'll be interested to hear her opinion on this matter, I doubt she knows anything about this yet.
-1 Western lies! Russia has no doping! Only superior athletes! 
-1 We already knew Russians are dopes
-1 I can’t wait for the Trump meltdown over this.
-1 Aww yeah bitchezzz! Putin is crying right now.
-1 Oh great, now Trump is gonna boycott the Olympics in solidarity with his puppetmaster. 
-1 Classic Russia  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
-1 Вы все знаете кого благодарить! 
-1 Like all of Russia?
-1 I didn't know making a dope our president had an official name.
-1 Honestly, i think it probably has more to do with politics. Williams sisters were given permission to use banned substances yet Sharapova was crucified for sonething that was just recently banned.With the amount of money athletes make, I don't blame them one bit. I did little semi unethical things at times to keep my job too when I was younger.
-1 So like what if they just show up anyway?
-1 [deleted]
-1 Good. 
-1 Go ahead and boycott Russia. Look how much the world doesn't care.
-1 You think other countries don't dope? 
-1 The US won more Medals in the [2012 Summer Olympics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics_medal_table) [AND 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics_medal_table) so mabe the US needs some checking into.
1 JFK: "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country"Putin: "Ask not what your country can do for you-ask what you can do for Russia including cheating, lying, killing because I'm bringing back USSR *Lite* flavor"
1 Wait, isn't it Russia who's hosting the 2018 winter olympics? Hahaha lmfao banned from their own competition.
1 Okay, cool. When can we ban them from participating in U.S. Elections?
1 So dumb. Punish individuals that fail drug tests or doping. I don't care what anybody says, banning an entire country under a flag is politically motivated. Oh, they can still compete but not under the Russian flag? Right, not politically motivated at all. But it's Russia, so who cares right, fuck all the athletes that haven't cheated.As if cheating isn't rampant in athletes in other countries. What a joke. Like everything it seems in western media these days, Russia's the target.Ban individuals who cheat. Not the country.
1 Apparently people don't realize that documentaries usually have a narrative to push.  It's usually biased so I would caution everyone to be careful not to use them as gospel.  People are making Grigory out to be a hero.  He is literally the guy who did it before unapologetically and seemingly without pressure to do so, IE on his own accord.  He got in some trouble and now he's taking advantage of his situation by using a documentary to levy support and sympathy for him.  You think he feels sorry about anything he did?  He left his family in Russia, while people connected were 'dying'.  He left his family there.  When people and families were dying, one thing you should do is make sure your family is safe, he didn't.  He isn't a hero.  Don't treat him like one.  With that type of person, how can you take everything he says at his word.  When he was doctoring documents and processes for Russia, you think he's only doctoring one thing and not another to benefit him?  You're naive to believe that.It sounds like I'm defending Russia, but I'm not letting some inflammatory documentary, that's playing on the recent I hate Russia phenom, push me to hate them more than I need to.  This Netflix documentary is what most people are basing their opinions from and nothing else.  The sole and important evidence is from Grigory, who is not to be trusted by anyone.  Dude hasn't a honest bone in his body.
1 Well you couldn't ban them while they were hosting the Winter Olympics in sunny Sochi, but hey, they were soo clean back then. IOC is as full of crap as is FIFA, rotten to the bone!!
1 Oh man, Trump is going to get an earful from Putin!
1 Yeah but who isn't doping? 
1 With historical perspective this decision will be held as a benchmark for the height of hypocrisy. It is widely understood in the world of athletics that winning a medal in any significant discipline in the Olympics is practically impossible without the use of PEDs. 
1 Anyone else really uneasy about the upcoming olympics? I've got a really bad feeling that some bad shit might go down.
1 Every medal won in 2018 will have an astrix next to it. Unless an athlete has been caught cheating there is no reason to ban them. Some of these athletes compete in league's with testing. Must all be cheaters I guess. Next time the Russians should be smart and fuck with everyone's lab samples.
1 In before all you libtards turns another /r/worldnews front page post into a political shitstorm.
-12 Wake up sheeple!!!! Russia isn't the only country that does this
-2 I read elsewhere that they will compete with neutral uniforms. So in essence, they are still allowing Russia to compete.
-2 The IOC is one of the most corrupt organizations on the planet, it is drastic need of reform.
-2 So they are able to "rig" the US election to put a puppet in office but cant get away with doping in a corrupt Olympics?  Sure.  
-2 I don't see what the big deal is. Let them use whatever substances they want. It's not like it makes them "superhuman." My dad always taught me work smart, not hard.
-2 Oooo putin is about kill some mo'
-2 State backed doping program huh? Russia was going to humiliate the west with these games but instead they got smacked down hard. Poor Russia they cant catch a break this year. 
-2 And collusion!
-2 This displeases the Trump
-2 Might as well delete all the medalwinnners in recent history, everyone was juicing.
-2 I'm gonna be contrarian here:Why not let Olympic athletes dope?  If they are literally the best in the world with the best suits and boards and training and what not, why not give them the best supplements i.e. steroids?Why draw the arbitrary line at equipment and whey protein.  Give them some HGH!
1 Why are the olympics even relevant anymore?
1 and the US doping program isn't an open secret? I think on this topic alone some whataboutism is justified.
1 This being total bs; this being where we ruskies dominate world of sports da.

1 The United States should be banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics for doping the GOP with Russian money and urine.
-5 I didn't know weed was a performance enhancer 
-3 Who will Trump root for now?
-4 Wait doesn’t the olympics allow transsexuals... who gives a fuck about the olympics now. 
-4 Yes ban Russia but not all the other cheats. Makes sense.
1 I think the best summary to Reddit as a site is people actively suggesting a Netflix documentary as a legitimate source of information on an international scandal of grand size.Proving plebbit memes day by day, post by post.
1 Crazy world we live in. Where is the proof ? 
-12 [deleted]
-4 This is as surprising as pretty much anything Trump says now a days.
-4 Now if only we could end this charade called the Olympics all together.
1 The funniest thing is that those allegations are probably all true and Russia fully deserves this, but so does China, the US, the UK etc. but nobody cares because they aren't the world's scapegoat at the moment.
-5 Canada Hockey Team wins gold! DONE.
-7 Russia dopes to win meanwhile liberals want biological men to be able to compete against women for easy medals.
-7 Now waiting for US to be banned, probably one of the biggest dopers.
-7 Why not ban the USA then? Just let every athlete dope and let the best doper win! If everyone dopes then everyone is on the same playing field therefore even competition.
2719 Why is the nhl pulled out of the Olympics?
403 I really hate that the NHL doesn't participate anymore. I totally get why, but those games were so fun to watch 
263 Will be the worst Olympic hockey tournament ever no doubt. Nobody will take it seriously.
95 Are any hockey fans even looking forward to the olympics this year?Personally I stopped caring as soon as the NHL pulled out, I feel like if it's not going to be some version of "the best" competing then it probably shouldn't be included in the olympics.
37 You'd have to go down to the middle school level for Canadians to not be fun to watch. Shame they'll have no Russians to play against though. I wonder if the silver will go to USA or a Scandinavian country.
5 JAMAICA WE GOT A HOCKEY TEAM!
6 The KHL already said they would pull out if this happened. They are probably going to leave the IIHF because of this. Pretty much means no players from the KHL can compete.
3 ...which is such a shame. Hockey is by far my favorite part of the Winter Olympics. I wish all the best NHL and KHL players would be able to play.
3 Both the IOC and NHL are to blame here. Fuck both of 'em really, moreso the IOC.
2 > This creates a very interesting situation for hockey.   Don't tell me you believe the Miracle of Ice had nothing to do with PEDs
2 Who the fuck is Canada going to compete against now?
2 Where were you when Ethiopia won the 2018 gold medal in men's ice hockey??
2 This is your chance, Jamaica!  
2 Canada, FtW.
1 I'm so sad that the NHL pulled out. Especially with my oilers eating crow, now I don't even have Olympic hockey to look forward to 
1 Russia was in a very good position to take gold too.
1 Watch the world juniors, it's awesome hockey. There's loads of talent out there and the younger "kids" haven't had all the free wheeling fun coached out of them yet. It's a lot more fun to watch than you think and better then 90% of pro games. The olympics will still be great to watch without the NHL/KHL. 
2 There's still Women's hockey which is really good.
1 So what your saying is that it's my time to get a medal?
1 Well to be fair, the world juniors are a lot of fun to watch so I'm not too worried. 
1 Let's make a team! I can finally be an Olympian!
1 Now it's Jamaica's chance to shine!
1 The KHL has already said no to the Olympics
1 Hey... maybe we can get the Olympics back to covering non-professional sport!  Unlikely, but it's possible.
1 Canada wins again!
1 [deleted]
1 Time for Shane Falco and the boys to lace up skates.
1 I'd say it creates a very uninteresting situation for hockey. The whole point of the Olympics is for the absolute best to compete. Without the absolute best it becomes just a random B-squad tournament, which isn't fitting. I say scratch hockey altogether until the best can attend.
1 > which would further lower the level of players participating in the tournament.jesus christ, what'll it be a bunch of amateurs out there ? at the Olympics of all places! ^^^/s
1 By interesting you mean less competitive. 
1 Does every entering country have a hockey team? 
1 The NHL pulling out of the Olympics just took away any excitement I typically have in anticipation of the Olympics. Hockey is in our blood as Canadians, and growing up I always felt the buzz of the community when we would all cheer together for our national hero's. To think that young hockey players won't get the same joy of cheering for their hero's at the peak of the sport saddens me. I don't mean to disrespect athletes from any other sport, but Olympic hockey is what I look forward to every 4 years and knowing that it won't be played at the highest level is really just like pancakes without maple syrup. Why even bother having it.
1 The Olympics is dead Imo. It's just turned into a giant country ego trip. 
1 Time to get my skates out from the basement. 
1 Doesn't the IIHF already have an agreement with the KHL allowing players to play?My understanding is the KHL already discussed this and the IIHF already told them to go ahead and try. 
1 So Canada vs USA finals?
1 A good part of the Finnish national team plays in the KHL and ice hockey is a big thing for Finns. I don't see this happening
1 I'm okay with NHL players not playing, gives a chance for more people to have lots of glory on the ice. They already got their's being where they are.  
1 Ovi is just like "ok then"
1 I was hoping Ovi would ignore the NHL and go to The Olympics to represent Russia. Now he can’t even do that. 
1 Dang it. I didn't know the NHL pulled out of the olympics. I love watching Olympic hockey but now I feel like we've lost a lot of the elite players of the world.
1 Might be a stupid question but what does the NHL have to do with the national team? Aren't they separated organizations? Or was there some agreement?
1 But also somewhat level the playing field, Russia had a huge leg up on everyone until now. It's one thing watching a bunch of average players getting killed by a much better team but now they will all appear much better because the skill levels are closer. Should still be interesting if you're a true hockey fan. 
1 Canada will still do really well. Actually all the usual countries will have amazing talent who just aren't in the pros.
1 In other words: Team Canada is fucked.
1 I’d be down to see the world juniors twice this year
1 This basically gives Sweden the gold in Mens hockey
1 You're saying I have a chance...
1 The NHL can PULL OUT of the Olympics, forbidding their players from going? Damn, commercial interests are WAY too powerful in the U.S. I feel bad for the athletes ...
1 The olympics is for amateur sports anyway. Why is professional hockey such a big emphasis there?
1 My guess is it will end up a bit like soccer. What once was the height of competition (the Olympic event) becomes secondary to the World Cup.
1 I think the khl has an agreement withthe IIHF which makes it a little more difficult for them to opt out, could be a lawsuit if they block foreign players. Maybe hockey players will get special dispensation
1 2018 Men's Hockey is going to be a shit show.
1 Finally a chance for one of the African Nations to shine in hockey.  
1 It's in the world interest to have Russia compete, as per normal, and if they test positive for doping withdraw the medals won relevant to the player. This Will just look like the IOC is jumping on the blame Russia for everything bandwagon.
1 So finland can finally get a gold in hockey?
1 Why doesnt the NHL participate? I thought Olympics is the highest level.
1 Olympics should include amateur players anyways.
1 If I'm an athlete and I have an option of winning a league title or an olympic medal I'm going to represent my country in the olympics 10/10. 
1 Canada is going to win anyway, so what's the point?
1 So college players then?
1 I think it's a good thing. The Olympics should allow some non-pro athletes compete. Now teams will have to build themselves from college kids and other non-pro hopefuls. Maybe it will be someone's big break to go pro who would have otherwise gone unnoticed. 
1 We all know Curling is the main attraction anyway, exciting stuff.
1 One of my favorite memories as a Canadian was the Canada USA final. What would that game have been without NHL players? I understand their reasoning for pulling out but I hate that they did. 
1 ppl give a shit about hockey in the olympics? TIL
1 Thats cool, I dont mind watching Canada win more hockey golds :D
1 >  lower the level of players participating in the tournamentTHIS MEANS WE FULLY HAVE A CHANCE!I can be 40something and marginally in shape and try out!!Lets DO THIS!  *Miracle on Ice 2, the Marginals*
1 Big break for the Jamaican hockey team.
1 is it finally finland's time for gold?
1 So Canada is sure to win then? I’ll live with that.
1 So, as someone who has never played hockey, you're saying that I have a chance?  This is my year!
1 Complete opposite. No one cares about hockey unless nhlers are there.
1 With the current ice hockey scene, you'd still end up with a professional level tournament.Not the best possible tournament, but professional anyhow.
1 Solution: let them participate, and only disqualify them *after* the olympics that way any medals they won aren’t accounted for and any medals that anyone else won against them is more impressive. Everyone wins! 
1 It would lower the skill level of players. It wouldn't lower the actual amount minus the Russians who might play. For a while the olympics didn't allow any professional athletes it was amateur athletes. 
1 Jamaica's time to shine!
1 The KHL is not allowed to stop its players from going, they have an agreement with the IIHF (which the NHL does not). They would face some serious repercussions if that happened
0 So it will return to a competition for amateur athletes as it was originally. 
0 Professional players shouldn’t be playing in the Olympics if it interrupts their season. Let’s go back to the days when college players played, maybe some semi pros too. 
0 That would actually make it really interesting, instead of millionaires playing it would be mostly good amateurs(CHL and NCAA) and pro's from smaller(comparatively) leagues like the Swiss, Finnish and Swedish leagues. I'd watch it.
0 Honestly, if the NHL is going to pull out, then the hockey tournament needs to be an amateur and collegiate tournament only.
0 The problem is that the KHL is governed by the IIHF, whereas the NHL is not. They would have to severe that relationship if they wanted to ditch the olympics.
7898 I'll make my own olympics! With blackjack, and polonium!
441 You can't fire me if I quit.
416 It's probably something lost in translation.Also some Russian sportsmen are still invited, if they are willing to participate under neutral flag. Probably they mean that our main TV channels will not show this Olympics, and government would not support athletes who want to participate under neutral flag.Also we may have here the end of Olympic movement in Russia. Putin will win next elections and he may not back down. M.O.C. may not back down too. One thing after another and Russia can miss 2020 Olympics too, If Russia misses 2022 Olympics that a generation of athletes who got screwed. Popularity of that career path would diminish. Also demography. So as the time goes Russia would be less and less interested in attending Olympics ( there wouldn't be much results to show so it just wouldn't worth the money)
46 "You can't ban us if we just don't go!"
54 flawless logic
63 "our country wasn't going anyways" 
42 Did they learn from Donny or vice-versa?
7 "Putin, u bum!"
6 "That's like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited" - Chris Rock
3 They can and will boycott TV translation for starters. With all the ads money and shit. 
3 well the retaliation would be interesting to watch, everyone knows all these machinations are the work of US intelligence services. Only a fool would think its natural without any salt and pepper in that regard. Also I would hope to watch russian roided up jock olympics, shot put and high jump after a liter of vodka, skiing down hill after a barrel of cognac or helicopter calisthenics and su-35 water polo
3 "u bum @iocmedia already said you ain't going! Therefore ain't no invite. Going to Olympics was a great honour before you showed up!"
1 It’s like uninviting a basketball player who said he wasn’t going to show up to the White House I imagine.
5 It's almost like inviting Steph Curry to come visit you and then, after he says "nah," rescinding his invitation.
2 Well I think they mean the Russian athletes who will compete under a neutral flag will boycott and won't be allowed to participate.
2  U bum. @IOC already said Russia can't go! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to the Olympics was a great honor until Russia showed up!
1 It's like rescinding an invitation that a basketball player already declined.
2 Maybe for future Olympic Games?
2 Going to the Olympics is considered a great honor for a hockey team. Russia is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!
2 They do the same thing with economic sanctions. It's hilarious.
1 Why won't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks 
1 The IOC said they could enter under a neutral flag
1 Ah, the classic Trump maneuver.
1 It’s Russia, don’t seek logic there 
1 In Russia, Olympics boycott you!
1 The classic "I didn't want it anyway" Donald Trump approach.
1 We can see e where Trump got his negotiation strategy from. 
1 Lulz
1 Some Russian athletes are invited to compete individually, not under Russian flag.
1 I doubt so, because ban lasts 2 terms and punishment for boycott lasts 3 terms.
1 I'm thinking they may boycott the 2017-2018 World Juniors
1 In Soviet Russian Olympics, S.R.O.C. ban you for NOT doping. 
1 Putin will order trump to boycott it
1 They were banned before, and most likley bought off the commitee. They will probably do it again.If you watch the documentary "Icarus" on Netflix, it shows how they are quite prepared to murder people to keep it secret they forged every single russian test in the last olympics.
1 Maybe it means they won't go to future ones
1 “If you don’t let us go, we’re not coming!”
1 They could refuse to return, or attempt to fracture the Olympic community.  Certainly refuse to host in the future, which will become more of an issue over time.
1 Idk how you can boycott from outside of the Olympics, Comrade. You cant even compete. 
1 "You can't fire me I quit!"
1 *"you can't leave me, I broke up with you already"*
1 Maybe they mean they're not going to televise the olympics in Russia, which probably generates a good chunk of revenue.
1 You can’t fire me. I quit!
1 You can't fire me, I quit!
1 IOC should tweet: "U bum @Russia you aren't even invited! Going to Olympics is a great honor so don't cheat next time!"
1 You can’t fire me! I quit!
1 You can’t fire me, I quit!
1 That's how Trump would do it.
1 If they do, we'll re-release Rocky 4 saying Ivan Drago is totally not even russian.
1 Well, pretty much every country pays the IOC for broadcast rights.  That's probably what Russia would boycott.
1 Social obfuscation. It's designed to send out mixed messages so that people not willing to look into it, will think it was the will of mother Russia not to participate.
1 You can't fire me! I quit!
1 "What a bum!"
1 Where do you think Trump learned these techniques from?
1 Where do you think Trump learned these techniques from?
1 So that's where trump got that from!
1 which they really wasn't interested to take part in, in the first place
1 this reminds me of when I had to decline being man of the year.Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!
1 You can't fire me... I quit!
1 It's like the same thing Trump says 
1 They're gonna make their own Olympics, with blackjack, and hookers, and steroids. Atlantic City should be the first host city.
1 The question is if they'll allow the exempt athletes to compete as neutrals. If the Russian OC boycotts the games they will probably have to stay at home. Otherwise they are free to compete.
1 They mean Russian organizations like the KHL. It’s the second biggest hockey league in the world and they are taking about banning European and North American players from participating 
1 It’s just so crazy that the entire country is banned. Hard to wrap my mind around that. 
1 "Well I guess you guys aren't coming to the 2018 World Cup!"
1 So Russia is going to rage quit basically.  Awesome. 
1 "You can't fire me, I quit!"
1 This was my thought exactly. Boycott what? You aren't allowed in. It's like men saying they're gonna boycott women's restrooms. Cool, no one cares.
1 Are they meaning Russian judges and representatives, not just athletes?
1 How you gonna hate from outside the club? You can't even get in! 
1 So the scores will be fair. 
1 Donald Trump disinvites people who turned down his invitation in the first place.It’s probably a Russia thing.
1 They'll win the gold in mental gymnastics.
1 > "Some Russian officials have threatened to boycott if the I.O.C. delivered such a severe punishment.">> So they will boycott something they aren't invited to?They don't really understand what "ban" means yet. Just wait until they get the letter explaining it.
1 I'm not surprised to see they're using one of Trump's favorite tactics. 
1 [Russia wants the all drugs Olympics](https://www.hulu.com/watch/4090). I, for one, want to see it. 
1 I don’t see how you can hate from outside the club,. You can’t even get in 
1 The athletes are allowed to participate, just not under the Russian flag. Russia could abide by this or make the athletes boycott. And a boycott would hurt everyone since the Russians are competitive in many events, and it would mean less for someone else to win those, because they had less competition.
1 Officials is referees, flag holders, helpers and stuff like that. Not athletes. 
1 Funny, Trump often takes the same tactic.
1 Sounds like Trump
1 yeah, like the Westboro baptist church boycotting a soldiers funeral.
1 dem russian ticket sales must be in the dozens.
1 I’m boycotting Rihanna’s panties!
1 "You can't fire me! I quit!"
1 So they can drop the DEFCON by another level
1 That is like Stephen Curry turning down an invitation to the White House from Trump, and then Trump said, "I un-invite him."    Dude, Trump...too late - you already got turned down.
1 Just. Like. Trump.
1 Theyre going to boycott from the inside of Ukraine
0 Jada Pinkett Smith all over again 
3474 It's nice to see a whistleblower actually vindicated. Also the Netflix documentary Icarus lays out the story really well for anyone who wants to know more.
341 At least two of his colleagues at the agency died suddenly too, which is what led him and some of his co-workers to flee the country. It sounds like quite a few people sacrificed a lot to bring this to light
505 What a great guy. Russia doesn't respond well to anti-Russian whistleblowers. I wish him the best.
146 Guy rolled the dice of his future for the truth, admirable.
21 It should also be noted that this guy had to leave his family back in Russia. He entered Witness Protection in the states and due to that will likely never see or hear from his family ever again.
24 Is he in hiding still?  I think he left his family back in Russia.  Sad.
5 For those who don't know he is in witness protection at the moment because of the threat against his life.Others have already been killed. Watch Icarus on netflix. Amazing documentary. 
3 It blows my mind that someone's life could be at risk surrounding a series of snow themed games. 
9 Reading that wikipedia page when all of the sudden: "“empirical evidence is totally to the contrary,” IOC member **Dick Pound** "
7 He should avoid night-time strolls on well-lit streets next to the Kremlin that have cameras conveniently turned off.
2 The Russians are so gonna try and kill him now
2 That guy is gonna get murdered...
2 I remember reading his Rodchenkov's story back when it was revealed (NYTimes?) and thinking that it was like taken straight out of a Le Carré novel. Wasn't his best friend and colleague murdered? 
2 Joe Rogan did a podcast with the dude that made the documentary "Icarus" which details the doping program and features Grigory.
2 His depiction in Icarus really made me see the sympathetic side of him. It's hard to see his story and not feel sorry for him.
1 It's crazy that he was given the choice of set up a doping program, or we leave you in this mental hospital. I think would've done the same thing he did. 
1 Russia deserves all the gold medals for cheating.
1 Maybe drop in a edit about the Netflix doc "Icarus" that follows the release of this whole story?!It,s amazing!
1 Only saw that documentary like a week ago.  No doubt Grigory would be dead right now had he not made a break for it when he did.  Unfortunately his family is having a rough go of it as a result.  I imagine things will only get worse for them now.
1 Get's all the doping classed meds from amerike, tells everyone its legit and defo not doping risky. Then gets lots of cash from white house as those meds become doping classed. Well played amerika, well played
1 I'm a bit confused. Weren't the Russian athletes banned from the last Summer Olympics? How does this play into that?
1 Sounds like he'll off himself by 2 bullets in the back of his head sooner or later.
1 A few good men
1 Dude's gonna be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his (possibly very short) life.  Kudos to him, but damn.
1 Honestly, I think he was just fucked over in this scheme massively and blew the whistle in revenge. Corruption in Russia is so deep in roots of everything, you have to have balls to go against it on such a huge scale, basically when your life is on the stake. Or you have to be really-really angry at people who fucked you over.
1 His journals (the brief bits I saw) were so strange to read. He documented every little tidbit in his life from the mundane to the highly illegal:"Ate breakfast of eggs and bacon today. Not enough pepper in the eggs. Found a penny on the street. Heads up! Organized vials of clean urine for the athletes. Not even arranged by name or sport! Went back to hotel and showered. Nice towels. Had dinner with Henry of steak and potatoes. Ate his grapes. Cocktail of steroids and HGH tested ok on myself. Heart rate: normal"
1 Well, actually he was known to sell doping to sportsman and somehow he landed to position of RUSADA head with support of Fetisov ex hockey player, then he just flee into US and sells Russia. Which actually rise a lot of questions. How the fuck our goverment missed him on landing there, how the fuck they missed him if they put him there to grab by the balls and could he be used by US to punish Russia for their challenge to US on geopolitics. So far indeed IOC was just a joke, because there were no actual true evidence and the only reason why there were so much bans and etc, because Russian goverment had no clue what to do. Athletes and federations that hired decent lawyers defended themselves and overturned decision, but this who left defence to goverment - fucked. Also i don't know why they didn't fired Mutko he is a moron and no one likes him in Russia, but talks about russian football team taking doping is a joke, unless they consider beer and cocaine a doping. Also i don't really understand why only Russia punished, when it was clear from german report that English football players buy doping and make it "legal". Kinda fishy to me.Also i don't understand why our paralympic team banned.
1 It's kinda amazing that so much money and effort was devoted to something as trivial as a gold medal in sports. The only tangible thing you can get out of this national prestige , which in itself is kinda stupid when you look at it from a international viewpoint. Does winning any number of gold medals provide you with any leverage in trade disputes? It seems like such a sunk cost when you factor that in. 
1 Grigorys actions are admirable, that documentary however, was terrible.
1 I put the movie on, not knowing exactly what it was about - thinking it was just a story of a guy trying to game the system. By the middle of it, I was totally engrossed and by the end, I was absolutely blown away. It was more thrilling than anything Hollywood can come up with! And no explosions needed! 
1 >he risked and still risks his life to make it publicAccording to the (awesome) Netflix documentary, he did it when he realized there was an immediate threat to his life over the scandal. He did it to protect his life, not for justice or something like that. Just to be fair here.
1 Does anyone know how he was able to come to the US? Does he just come here and apply for asylum?
1 Keep an eye out for car bombs, bud.
1 Russians have a long history of integral individual's flouting the state at their own peril.  
1 Yesterday I heard about him on TV and looks like our government plays "He's insane. Mental patient of Kaschenko." card. I thought they go for "He's agent of USA"
1 Well, almost everyone I know do not respect him at all, but then again.. He'll just live (if he'll live) rest of his life under strict CIA supervision and protection, because literally 150 million people wanna see him in coffin.
1 Oh god, inb4 polonium tea all over again.
0 The IOC is a joke. Everybody uses PEDs at the Olympic level. Just a matter of who gets caught.
-8 Rodchenkov should be in jail by any account. If there was any doping system, it was created by him, for his own profit. He is a criminal, who should treated like one, and not praised.

-47 I wonder what would lead one to betray their country like that. If I were Russian I'd hate him too.
986 Unfortunately, Russian officials are already playing the propaganda game on this one. Even the official questioned in the article basically said, "ask not what Russia should do to fix this situation, the world should ask what they can do to help Russia." Which is *pompous, arrogant, and in line with their ongoing geo-political intent to lie, manipulate, cheat, and disrupt much of the Western world and parts of Asia as much as they can -- rather than growing up and acting as a responsible world partner. I don't see it stopping. If anything they will hire a team of scientists to come up with more sophisticated methods of cheating. 
22 Or just accepting it.
444 But they're still competing, just not under the Russian flag.
9 Like the 70s. Or the 80s. Or 90s. Or lance Armstrong....i give up dope for everyone.
8 Why would you want them to crack down on doping? There's no way to test for some forms of doping, and approximately 80% of players dope. There are safe forms of athletic doping. By disqualifying some, you're singling them out by not catching the rest, which is the vast majority of professional athletes. Steroids aren't the danger they were thought to be. 
12 Why crack down? Before long gene doping will take place and be untraceable. How about we embrace doping and as some sports have done have a doping and a natural league...
2 It may be as well an end to Olympics. I am in Russia and not a fan of big sport (Garfunkel and Oates nailed it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fraSdN-PG8) and I hope it will be the end of it for Russia. World championships aren't really that good from PR standpoint. We are banned from Olympics ( and I don't see neither Russia nor  MOC deescalating) so there is no point to put money into it ( in Russia Olympic level sportsmen are funded by government)I hope my government will start building more pools for common people instead of training few genetic freaks.
2 “Cracking down”...
1 If that’s not Putin it in perspective for Russia idk what will.
1 Its not like the Russian government lying and cheating at fucking everything is a new occurrence. It's the one constant in the land of beets. I mean, that and beets.
1 That's definitely not going to happen, so far the other countries have been just better at hiding doping, ahead of the testing tech, and making sure there are no whistle-blowers. This will just make them even more careful.
1 Ohhhhhh unprecedented instead of unpresidented...I was wondering what the big deal was about that whole fiasco.Sorry English isn't my first language.
1 Maybe they can just allow all doping and we can have super human olympics. Seems like the most fair for everyone. 
1 This is only possible because Russia is politically isolated and because of the documentary Icarus. No way in hell that this will change anything in the western countries or competitive sport in general. It won't even change anything in Russia.
1 Some ultramarathons have started testing for doping this year. One in particular called Western States (100 mile race) saw top athletes rankings plummet over previous years. One of the top finishers from last year saw a finishing time increase of over six hours. Maybe someone that runs ultras can comment but to me that seemed pretty suspicious.
1 I can't think of a single sport that doesn't have doping. It's too ingrained at this point. The risk for being a super star is too great. 
1 Honestly, I think in the future looking back we will look at not using PED's as just silly. At least  in professional sports. Kind of like slapping science in the face. We will also look at the Olympics and not paying the athletes as bullshit. 
1 We should go the other way and have everybody take drugs. The Olympics get boring
1 Why doesn't everyone dope and we have the dopest Olympics ever? Who can dope the best? I'm sure it's the U/S. We got a lot of dopes, one is vice-president!
1 Or the start of ''anything goes'' sport competitions. 
1 Any professional athlete is doping...
1 On the next Olypmpics US swimming team will come to 1000 m swimming distance with an own motor boat and IOC will accept it, because US team will show the papers\note with diagnos, that team can't swim and can't preform without a boat.
1 Do most people even care about the Olympics? It just seems so outdated and pointless. 
1 Wasn't Russia banned before?
267 This is crazy. I legit just finished Icarus not 5 minutes ago and then I jump on Reddit and see this. At the end, they threw up all the stats and said as of now, Russia will be competing in future Olympic events. That of course pissed me right off, but this just gave me immediate satisfaction. The other side of the story though is that this is a systematic issue. The methods in place to prevent doping are hardly effective due to the disconnection between those who are policing the athletes and the Olympic organization themselves who are just as corrupt as the Russian government.
7 Not just doping but I remember reading some shady things going on with judges being paid off or whatever. Especially in figure skating, which is where I first read it. They had to give Sale and Pelletier gold along with the Russian pairs because of some shenanigans iirc ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics_figure_skating_scandal)). Even before that there had always been rumours of fixed judging with figure skating. There were news articles in which the Russians were on tape boasting of being able to influence judges, like conspiring to place Bourne and Kraatz in fourth place. [link](http://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.306552)It’s being going on for so long. It’s one of the reasons why I don’t watch the olympics anymore. You just never know if anything is real. I don't know which is more corrupt, the Olympics or FIFA.
11 Russia is just basically one giant criminal organisation on the world stage
4 Now ask yourself this. If steroids is such an advantage to athletes performing at the top level, do you believe Russia is the only one that is using them if they are not winning all the medals?The documentary was good and well worth the watch!
1 You must not watch sports very often because its obviously pretty common at any professional level. Its just a matter of not getting caught.
1 I thought it was common knowledge that the USSR doped all the time too?I remember seeing a short doc on how the East German women’s swim team were known to be taking tons of testosterone. So much that some of them developed deep male voices. And the East German official response was “They’re not here to sing” lol
1 If you like Icarus, you might like bigger, stronger, faster. the side effects of being american.
1 Oh that’s on my list of movies to watch this week. Guess I need to watch it tonight. 
1 all documentaries manipulate reality. 
1 If you have time, listen to Rogans podcast he did a few weeks back - I believe his guest was the film maker (that's how I heard about Icarus). Really interesting. 
1 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCBIpKCdI Joe Rogan had Brian Fogel the producer of Icarus on his podcast a few weeks ago it's definitely worth a listen 
1 If you follow the olympic games, you know IOC are corrupt as hell.
-10 > This is about the shadiest thing I've ever seen in sports: State sponsored doping for athletes.   *ahem* Miracle on Ice
1398 The should also watch rocky 4. The Russian dude cheated god dammit! 
25 I'm still beyond pissed about the Sochi Olympics. The refs in the Japan vs Russia women's hockey game should have ended in a Japan win, but the paid off refs had something else to say about that. No way they could let the Japanese Women's team, in their first Olympics, beat their Russian hosts
30 I just watched this last night! Very timely viewing.
4 Don't they conclude Icarus with the fact that EVRYONE is cheating tho?
3 It was good but I felt it dragged like 45 minutes in.
3 Can they give Yu Na Kim her gold medal now please?
24 Yeah thank god all the other athletes were clean. Awesome to see how they still managed to outperform the cheaters. Not suspicious at all.
9 Joe Rogan? Is that you?
18 Don't pretty much all olympic athletes dope? I always thought the special part about Russia was that it's state funded.
1 Icarus is fucking awesome.
2 Yeah. And some of the judges clearly favored Russian athletes.
2 Literally EVERYONE
1 Meh watch the boxing competition in the recent london games. Who is not cheating? 
0 Russia has a huge cheating problem as a nation.Lots of bribery, corruption, cheating in the olympics, they even cheat disproportionately often on video games. About 1200% more than most other nations.
0 But they're still competing.
0 Is there a link to a video where they blatantly cheated by any chance?
1 Everyone should also [watch this,](https://youtu.be/kM-91sthsaE?t=3s) which many, many people contend is an eyewitness account of how Russian athletes have doped in the past.
12 The star witness so-to-say is Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's antidoping laboratory. He now lives in the U.S. under the protection of federal authorities.
1 No that’s too detectable, likely be a ricin dart, that’s their preferred mode anyway. 
1 Now FIFA needs to double down on this and pull the Russia World Cup!
1 We'll see how long this ban holds.
1 THIS. A separate Olympics but only for people that dope.  
1 Jumps could be way longer without drugs. They would just have to build jumps with longer flying zone.
1 Nah I don't think Hillary gives a shit, so they're safe.
495 Proven clean athletes will still get to compete under neutral uniform and flag. If they win a gold, the ceremony will raise an Olympics flag and play the Olympics anthem.
5 Except that their birthplace will be nearly erased from the Olympic ceremony if they win.They will be forced to represent the comittee that banned the rest of their team.You may hate Russia, but the Russians don't hate Russia. Not sure how this is being missed by so many Redditors.
13 Brother it's the Olympics, everyone is doping, it's just who gets caught. If you think all Olympic level athletes aren't doping you fucking crazy.
3 As well as the athletes that cheated, but didn't get caught!
1 *didn't get caught cheating
9 please be sarcasm
1 Every professional athlete is doping. You are extremely naive if you think otherwise. 
9 Yeah this concentrates the punishment on Russia, and those athletes that cheated, while enabling clean athletes to participate.  A good compromise all around.
2 Most of those are just athletes they couldn't prove cheated.
1 Oh yeah, guilty until proven innocent is so fair!
1 I believe they will never accept such a shit, while they teampleayrs were banned without any, a repeat any relevant proof, acceptable for common court. Ony words of paid Rodchinkov. No one court will accept such kind of proofs like "possible", "maybe", "could be" and so on. The fact is the fact - there is no pissitive doping tests results for banned sportsmen. And never were.
1 But if they win a medal do they get to keep it?
1 Yes but they can't wear their countries colors and get their flag displayed. This turns triumph into humiliation. If you're deemed clean to compete you should be allowed to show your colors. Russia is a country, not a sports organization.This decision clearly was not made purely from a sports point of view but is connected to the wave of russophobia that is gripping the western world.The modern Olympic games were introduced to help the world come together. Todays decision does the opposite.Edit: I'm not saying those who were caught doping shouldn't be banned. Of course they should be. But banning an entire country - no matter how widespread doping is - leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.
1 That's great. When I first read the headline I though, "wow that sucks the most for the Russian athletes who didn't dope." But this makes me happy. 
1 they won't. They will boycott. This olympics will be a disaster!
1 Don't be so happy. It will be viewed as a betrayal against Russia if they do compete. I don't except any of them to actually compete there.
1 But what about team sports. Will there be an Russia hockey team under Olympic flag?
405 He's trying to keep Russia relevant on the world stage with a weak hand.  He has sorta accomplished this, tho he has also made Russia even more weak, but hey, we're talking about them, so win?
167 Psh. It started with Yeltsins "economic shock therapy" when converting to capitalism in the early 90s. Immediately the wealth was distributed to the oligarchs and the corruption was all she wrote. After he dissolved the parliament, smashed the uprising, scrapped the constitution, and banned political opposition - he resigned and named his Prime Minister as his successor. A Mr. Vladimir Putin. Anyway the point is, this isn't new. It's been a feature of Russia's government since the Soviet Union dissolved. There's never been a time it wasn't like this, unfortunately. 
263 Hopefully this is the beginning of his end. 
56 If this is what they do when it comes to something as trivial as a sports competition imagine the resources and tactics Putin uses in influencing national elections, international relations etc...
6 Not to mention he's turning the country into an Orthodox theocracy with a boot on the neck of any religion the patriarch of Moscow doesn't like. 
5 > For the past few years, what positive thing has he accomplished for Russia or for the world? He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.Lol, he turned a rogue mafia state into a world power. Say what you want about the man (he's clearly evil), but he is the most stability Russia has seen for a long time.
9 I don't get it. You can do good for the people and *still* be the richest, most powerful individual there is.
3 Russia has been a mafia state since the fall of the SSR.
6 > He turned a world power into a rogue mafia stateFucking what? Fucking **what**? OK. Let me give you a history lesson then.1991\. USSR collapsed. There is no solid government apparatus, the republics are declaring independence, the economy is in shambles, and all that after a referendum in which most of the population voted for USSR to remain a thing. No matter. It's not like USSR was something good or proven to be efficient, so fine, the majority isn't always right.The 90s. Chaos envelops all the countries of former USSR. Russia is no exception. Mafia rules the streets, the government can't function properly, economy is getting worse by the day, tanks fire on the House of Councils, and the government members are on both sides. So, chaos is everywhere. Ruble is shit, smart people use the dollar. Gunfire in the streets. Yeltsin wasn't popular. The election was pretty much bought entirely by the US. Doesn't matter, he tries to do something. The country has to survive, so even if it means humiliation, he does what he can to keep it together. But he's no leader. Drunk and weak, corrupt and hated. He's still blamed for the chaos of the 90s in Russia, and for the humiliation it endured during that time. But he did manage to get a few capable people around him. Doesn't matter if it's greed, lust for power or patriotism that motivated Putin. He was capable. And he was unknown to the public. So, on New Year 2000, Yeltsin announces that he leaves earlier than the terms declare, and puts Putin as the acting president. The country is still shaky, but somewhat better than during most of the 90s. A few months later, an election is held, Putin wins with 52%. Fair or not, makes no matter.Putin takes a firm control. He is not bending easily like Yeltsin, he does not let the regional governors do whatever they want. In a short time, he brings order and stability. He shows strength in Chechnya, but also understanding of the situation, because he knows that if you install a Moscow government there, the war will never end. So there is a compromise, which is not good, but it's the best that can be done to prevent further fighting. Putin gets more and more popular. In 2004, he wins with over 70% of the votes. There's no need to rig the election - he's the only one people respect at the moment. But at the same time, he meticulously cuts out any potential opposition. He's not a dictator, he doesn't have all the power. But he is the most influential person in the government, and he wants to keep it that way. Whether it's because he is used to power, likes it, or because he's a patriot - doesn't matter. The opposition is kept docile, and the rest are destroyed before they even get a name and a chance. But the quality of life grows. The economy becomes more stable, the overall services and goods are on a level similar to that of European countries. There's an echo of the 90s and the USSR, but mostly, life is better than it was in all of Russia's history. Even the 2008 crisis only slowed it down by a little, the recovery was fast and smooth. And so we come to today. From a chaotic semblance of a country, where mafia rules and corruption is everywhere, to a country where there is order and stability - the 2014 crisis was a hard hit, yet now the GDP is on the rise, and most of the sanctioned products that regular people needed have been replaced by local producers or by imports from other countries. He turned a shithole into and actual country. Vile methods have been used along the way, no doubt. The control of the government is stronger than in European countries, and the media is indeed not as free. And that is worthy of being criticized. But you always have to keep in mind why some of those things were done. Russia needed a strong central power. Without it, order would never have ensued. Russia had no previous experience of a real democracy. The methods used in USSR were the only ones that they personally knew. Russia couldn't afford a continuous war with Chechnya, nor could it afford a rogue caliphate next to its border. I won't excuse Putin's actions, true or false. What happened in Ukraine is not excusable, and I'm sure that there's Russian support, though I'm doubtful of the claims that there is a whole army of Russians there. Killing of anyone, be they journalists or politicians opposed to Putin is not excusable. Sure, some of them can be attributed to crime, and some to Chechen government and rogue elements, but even then, it's still partially Putin's responsibility. And some can't be attributed to anyone else at all. Russia has gone through a period when a strong central apparatus was needed. And unfortunately, the side effect of that is the lack of further alternatives - the only opposition that manages to stay around is docile, or shitty one like Navalny. And that needs fixing. But claiming that Putin hasn't done anything good for Russia, even if you only limit the scope to the last few years, that is idiotic. Putin has always had Russia's interests in mind, and the many internal reforms are steadily making things better. He may not be a good man, I won't get into that. But he is someone I can respect. What he did for Russia is commendable. I do believe he needs to go. Many do. But there are no good alternatives right now. I do not mean to offend you. I am somewhat angry, it's true. But all I ask is to learn history before making claims like the one in your comment.
25 Yeah, 90s-era Russia was some world power...
2 He's not trying to improve Russia, much less the world. Just his bank account.
2 He weakend the american hegemony over world politics which is a good thing. 
1 Of course. And he knows it full well. The only thing he actively does is destabilise the west and then point at it. “You see comrads, Russia only sane country. Better stay here.”Because rigging the polls isn’t enough he also tries to make a majority vote for him that way. 
6 Is he personally liable for any wrongdoing here?
1 I feel like as long as Russia shows some military power, Russians will vote for Putin.
1 He's done a lot for shirtless dad bod. 
1 I mean, to be completely honest he's the reason that the Russian Federation is even world power still. Not that I'm defending the guy, he's a real piece of shit, but you have to give credit where it's due.
1 Well, still better than soviets.
1 I hate Putin, but my roommate who is a Putin apologist has made some good points on the economy, bringing them up out of the post-Soviet era... But then, I'm thinking that has more to do with oil than anything else
1 He stopped the bloodthirsty US plunging Syria into a far worse war than it is in now, delaying or hopefully preventing yet another round of them training tomorrow's convenient enemy.
1 Putin has as much to do with this as Trump has to do with EA Battlefront shenanigans. He's not a god king, he's the president. He's waging 2 wars while puppet mastering the world from the shadows, he doesn't give two shits about some silly doping scandals. After all, it's a democratically elected government with a democratically elected president. They do have tyrannical powers and opposition is basically a sham, but it's still citizens actually going out and voting for them because the alternatives are even worse (communists and ultra nationalists).What happened is that these shenanigans came out and instead of investigating or admitting fault, Russian officials decided to do absolutely nothing, deny it and do shady stuff and basically told WADA and everyone else to go fuck themselves. This is the result, they are punishing the country, not necessarily the athletes. They thought WADA/IOC etc. were bluffing and nothing would happen, turns out they were wrong.Putin is getting a LOT of bad press unjustifiably. He's known to step in and pull the plug on a lot of corrupt shit in Russia but he's a single man and his influence is not infinite and he has to pick his battles. Today he is preparing to leave power so more and more is left to his minions to handle. For example the whole anti-gay propaganda law thing is purely officials and lawmakers, Putin has nothing to do with it and he has stayed away from it because that's how a democracy works. Lawmakers make laws, president signs them into law even if he doesn't like them.Here the same thing happened. Putin DID NOT step in and let the ministries and officials fall on their asses. After all, Putin cares deeply about Russia and wants Russia to be a glorious superpower again like Soviet Union used to be.This cannot be done with him personally seeing things through. He has to delegate and let people handle things themselves so that his legacy will be "savior of Russia". He's trying to get the machinery running and stable so that if the next president is shit, it won't cause a collapse of the country. Just like Trump became president and.... nothing happened. The nation didn't implode and his influence is minor at best and everything he tried to do didn't work out like with the travel bans and all.TL;DR Putin is preparing Russia to survive without him as a robust and stable nation and he lets the officials and ministries make their own mistakes and live with them and NOT step it at every corner.
1 They're a superpower of distrust. With that kind of mentality and aspiration you end up with a dangerous cocktail.
1 >He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.Yeah...no. Try "turned barely functioning mafia fail-state on the verge of collapse into somewhat functioning FSB state". He's done a lot but it's just him staying in power post-2008 was a starting point of decay which worsens over the years.
1 It's been a mafia state for a century. Putin is an old-school Soviet leader. Nothing new.
1 > He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.That's most of Russian history. Minus the world power part, until recently.
1 Russians love him and it's not your country - Tough shit if you don't like him he serves the Russians not you. 
1 I mean, what does Russia even produce?  Do they export anything besides election hackers, and T_D trolls?  I've never seen anything in a store that said "Made in Russia."  (except Vodka)
1 This comment is so on the money. Putin has tuned Russia into a straight up and down Kleptocracy.
1 dank memes
1 >He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of ittwo world powers actually
1 > Real sick of Putin at this moment.Oh, like him giving the US President Donald Trump wasn't enough.
1 This is going to hurt him. He needs the prestige, that's why they worked so hard to cheat. 
1 He will use this card for elections 100%. Like: "Evil west always against Russia, we have to unite around strong person, around national leader" and etc. I was born in 1994 and almost don't remember Yeltsin for example. I'm so tired of Putin and feel hopeless. 6 more years and things will be worse and worse.
1 What the hell are you talking about ? Do some research before you post shit like this without evidence to back it up i swear some of the comments here are ridiculous and being up voted for no reason.
1 Well he's really good at distracting people from the fact that the country he rules over is gradually crumbling away into nothing.
0 It's absolutely delicious how oblivious Redditors can be to basic world politics and events in these default subs.And given the obliviousness, I'm not talking about everyone else.
1 Didn't he de-arm a shit ton of nukes? In line with some international agreement.Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted, I did a bit of googling and found [New START](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_START#Russia) And according to wikipedia, Putin apparently wanted to extend New START in his first telphone conversation with Trump, which Trump was against. I'm not a Putin advocate or anything. I think the guy is bad for the world, full stop.
1 annexed Crimea 
1 He helped stopping ISIS progression in Syria. Syria is close to Turkey and they had a lot of commercial agreements with ISIS. Turkey is also close to Europe. Now imagine a post-US Irak on your doorstep. Europe should be thankful for that. 
1 A) he is under no obligation to accomplish anything positive for the world as large same as any head of state of any country. B)We are currently not in a war are we? Would it have been someone less cold-blooded, someone less "spymaster" there would have been a shooting war going. Americans had been pushing russians for years, with the expansion of NATO, with the missiles in poland both of which are direct threats to russian security. What if they dealt with the threats the way US does? By bombing them with or without the approval of UN? So yes, we should be grateful that Putin is there otherwise we would have all been in WW3 for a few years now. 
-2 He has done so many good things. You just get the good informations filtered out in your english news bubble. And you actually believe it. No wonder trump won.
-1 > For the past few years, what positive thing has he accomplished for Russia or for the world? He turned a world power into a rogue mafia state with himself at the top of it.You mean beside defeating ISIS funded by Saudi Arabia, US and Israel and saving hundreds of thousand of lives?I guess nothing impresses you.
0 You also understand that doping in Russia dates back to a long time 
0 Putin got his puppet elected and now all sanctions are removed or ignored. Plus he knows all our secrets now. A master spy's wet dream
0 Dictators in power long enough always turn into nothing more than petty thugs. Putin has become nothing but a destabilizing force globally, I won’t miss him when he’s gone! Edit: a word 
0 >For the past few years, what positive thing has he accomplished for Russia or for the world?He kinda sorta helped defeat ISIS, I guess? But even then it was through some pretty shady methods. Definitely still not something that would earn him my adoration by any stretch of the imagination with what he's doing to global politics.
0 Please pick up a history book. It will help you a lot.
1 defeating Isis
-10 [deleted]
-4 He ended the war in Syria. That's pretty big
-1 I am glad that something is being done against Putin, even if its not yet in the sphere of election rigging
16 It's really amazing how the KGB were able to tamper with the "tamper-proof" containers of urine.  Watch Icarus on Netflix if youre curious
-11 Do you know, that you just posted the lie, becuase words, which were cutted off from context is a lie? No one test was doping positive form these sportsmen, but you type:>>  More than two dozen Russian athletes have been disqualified from the Sochi standings as a result,What a shame.
332 They deserve a good bitchslap. They're a mafia state. This will infuriate Putin, have no doubt about it, he was going to take not being able to use their flag as a "humiliation." After 27 Russians were caught cheating why should they *not* be banned. Good indeed.
-1 Agreed. 
0 Dope.
55 I wonder how much that documentary weighed into this decision.
3 Isnt available in my country :(
1 It's definitely a docuthriller. Takes a complete turn about a quarter way in and is a rollercoaster ride from then on. They coincidentally happened across someone looking to flip at the perfect time, all while filming an otherwise forgettable Armstrong doping experiment.
1 All documentarties manipulate reality. Even nature documentaries.
23 Plenty of these Russian athletes already did such a thing [at the recent World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorised_Neutral_Athletes_at_the_2017_World_Championships_in_Athletics).
2 !remindme 3 months
1 Imagine the international backslash if he didn't let them.
2 I know we like to rip on Putin but Russia has 150 million inhabitants. Let's not pretend Putin is singlehandedly directing every single one  of them to help him in his nefarious schemes.
1 Why not? It won't hurt his power.
0 Mate almost every country cheats
4 Damn nothing really to respect about their country now sadly. 
-3 So what you are saying, everyone cheats.Surprise surprise.
-8 Russia, Republicans, Give me the D instead
168 They can still compete. Proven athletes can go under a neutral flag
29 There's still an opening for some Russian athletes to compete with a neutral flag.That is, if Putin lets them and doesn't try to boycott or something.
5 I don't know if you're really that naive or just kidding, but no one at the elite level is clean. Literally, and I mean literally, all competitors are cheating.
6 “Clean ones” in the olympics?... okay lol
1 that would reduce the olympic population to 0. no top level athletes are clean.
0 i don't understand why you would tho.... allow the clean ones to participate... and the doped ones not too... banning a country is fucking stupid imo.
0 They were/are ALL dirty. It is a state sponsored doping programme, the athletes don't choose if they want to be part of it; it happens to them. The guys that design the doping programme are the same guys that design the WADA tests to detect doping. The system is rigged from the inside out and WADA is a political entity that exists to maintain a facade of credibility on the Olympics. The Olympics is a money making machine and it's in their interest to have them continue, even though it's costly too cities and disruptive to 'real' competition; too many people in the IOC are making too much money. In an interview with the creator of Icarus, the director said one of the things Grigory told him was that there are routinely planned positive results - usually for an unimportant athlete with little chance of winning anyway - so as to maintain the perceived credibility of WADA. Pretty much every country's team dopes. Look at the US track and field team from the 80's and 90's! Ben Johnson was on so many steroids his eyes were yellow. No sprinter's body gets jacked like that naturally, ever. Have a look at amateur competition and you'll see the difference. It's laughable. 
1 Careful now, everybody will think you're a Russian puppet!
89 Yeah they even let the Nazis host the Olympics.
46 The Nazis were just a "political party" when Germany hosted the Olympics. 
10 But for certain countries it's an honor thing, especially when you're hosting the games to lose is embarrassing but to get destroyed (basketball any year) is a dishonor. I will never understand how people could cheat at that level though, you are just stealing the award from who truly deserves it.
7 > Like, there's no real prize at the end. You know that, right? It's not like the Olympics people give you a hundred GDPs for winning.Um there is a *very* real prize for winning games at the Olympics. It's called nationalism. Russia relies on propaganda and nationalism to keep it's population in check and to have power over it's people. Cheating in the Olympics to make the masses think Russian athletes are best athletes is *extremely* smart and has a massive pay-off. It's pathetic that they rely on lies and manipulation to control their people, but the strategy of cheating at the Olympic games to do so is pretty damn smart. The world stage is just lucky that there were men brave enough to come forward and be whistleblowers on the operation.
4 No GDP prize but the rise in support for Putin after Sochi definitely played a role in his ability to successfully annex Crimea. May not be a monetary prize but Olympic success does help geopolitically.
3 There isn't a monetary prize per say, but the geo-political impact for Putin after "winning" Sochi was huge! Putin's approval rating soared to 83% after those Olympics. What happened next? They invade Crimea.
4 > Jesus Fucking Christ, they didn't even ban the goddamn *Nazis* from the Olympics.To be fair, there wasn’t as much international pressure against racism at the time. IIRC FDR didn’t meet with Jesse Owens after ‘36 and when Owens was in college he had to ride in segregated buses. Also...don’t Hitler meet with him or shake his hand afterwards or something?
2 GDP = God Damn Points
2 Were the nazis doping?  This is about their actions at the Olympics, not a comment on the country or government's general policies.
1 > Like, there's no real prize at the end. Most countries pay out huge sums of money for winning gold. 
1 Nazi Germany wasn't really vilified in 1936. They had their fair share of admirers in the US and some think we even prevented some of our own Jewish athletes from particpating as to not offend the Germans.They made a point to look really good during their hosting as well.
0 >how fucking pathetic do you have to be to cheat at the Olympics? Like, there's no real prize at the end. You know that, right? It's not like the Olympics people give you a hundred GDPs for winning.Yeah because there's literally no gain to being the best in the world at something. /s
1 >Also, how fucking pathetic do you have to be to cheat at the Olympics? Like, there's no *real* prize at the end. You know that, right? It's not like the Olympics people give you a hundred GDPs for winning.You shouldn't discount the importance of national pride in a successful Olympics, especially a home Olympics. 
1 Russia has always been pretty desperate to establish themselves in any aspect of administrative talent. But then again, so has the U.S. We're just better at it. Well, where it counts - our gunz. 
1 Well if u believe Icarus, winning the olympics gave putin's government the popular support/approval that it rode to then invade ukraine. 
1 I guess most 100m sprinters are pathetic.
1 Well the Nazis at least didn't cheat (as far as I know) and the olympics are after all (officially) a sport competition and not a political one. 
-8 everyone cheats, if you read about the other athletes that cheated you will see that they got far less severe punishment even when they have been caught multiple times. This is plain and simple political, because the winds of politics blow against russia everyone is keen to pile on to show how they are "not on their side". 
-5 I’m sorry, but almost everybody at the Olympics is on or has used PEDs of some sort. They just have their doping programs on point and never fail any tests. The Russians simply aren’t smart enough to pull it off. 
1 Your stupidity pissed off Germans, Russians, and anyone educated. The Nazis were a political party in the making, before committing atrocities or starting a war. Of course Germany was able to host the Olympics.
1 Nobody knew what the Nazis were doing in 1936.> there's no *real* prize at the endSuper ignorant statement. Olympic medals are a big source of national pride for a lot of countries. Governments pour millions into these programs to stay relevant on the world stage.
1 .. that moment when on a major subreddit Russians being treated as worse than Third Reich.. Okay, I guess we're past the point of sanity or any costructive discussion, let alone about any respect for each other, goodbye.
1 Why? There’s no such thing as an “honest” athlete in the olympics. They all dope, Russia just got caught. The honest athletes are stuck in the minor leagues and won’t be affected by this.
35 Hillary winning the Tour de France was pretty suspicious.
8 They really need to strip Hillary of her Tour de France wins... it's shameful, really.
7 > Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened, he totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen. It's very, very unfair. Just unbelievable. Putin will be very insulted. 
16 InB4 Trump threatens to have the US boycott the Olympics unless Russia is let back in. 
9 Honestly, something close to this wouldn't surprise anyone at this point.
5 I mean really, when will Trump finally impeach Hillary! /s
1 Trump will probably try to get US athletes to boycott out of sympathy with his love, Putin.
1 /r/conservative: "This is an insult to Christian Russia!  This is Hillary's doing!  This is what white genocide looks like!"
1 Didn't have to scroll far to find someone shitting on Trump. It's like you people are obsessed with him. 
8 >Most didn't even know they were getting doped by their coaches.       I'm not saying you're wrong, but this is peaking my BS meter. Do you have any sources on this? And why would someone slip another person steroids, and another question, how would they not notice?        *Doc, my hair is thinning, my nipples are puffy, my testicles are atrophying, I'm having mood swings, but my gains are going through the roof...No clue what's going on.*
17 Billions, soshi cost $55b 
3 How does one not know they're getting doped? Are you saying the players are unknowingly ingesting drugs? Not attacking you or anything, just curious. Super fucked up if true.
1 When there's state-sponsored efforts to dope, punishment has to be against the state that did it.There's still a route for clean competitors from that country.I'm not sure why you'd want to open the doors to doping athletes where it "wasn't their fault" since that's not the point. Also, I highly doubt your use of "most" in that final sentence.
1 The checks already cleared 
0 >  Most didn't even know they were getting doped by their coaches  If you are athlete who is getting doped without your own knowledge, I am not going to feel awful for you. Something like that shows your level of self awareness  and olympic spirit clearly. There is no way person who honestly strives for self improvement and hones spirit of competition can be doped without their awareness.
0 > Gotta feel awful for the athletes that want to represent their country. Athletes that test clean will be able to compete under a neutral/Olympic flag.
16 If you're thinking that North Korea would even think to try something stupid during the Olympics you worry for nothing. Remember that ~~the~~ China really does take the Olympics seriously and wouldn't be very happy if Kim did something to ruin the event.Edit: the the  words are hard but it's staying.
1 Why do you think there's a problem?
1 I logged in just so I could upvote you.

1 They banned the country as a participant, the athletes including the Ice hockey team can still go, just under the neutral flag and anthem.  
1 Same! I mentioned that up-thread. I thought I was the only person who felt something was weird about figure skating in Sochi. It was never mentioned in the news or anything, so I thought maybe I was just imagining things.
1 Sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, a family company. 
1 North Korean athletes participate in the Olympics, too. That's incredibly unlikely
7 If evidence of state sponsored doping programs come to light i believe the same would happen to them. Until then nothing can happen. 
37 Literally every Olympic athlete is on gear. 
17 Like the US isn't as well?EDIT: I'm not saying the USA has systemic doping the level of Russia did in Sochi - I'm just saying they definitely have doping at a high level with lots and lots of people involved to make sure their athletes test clean.
1 China will be banned when they will be on the political agenda. 
-1 Go watch Icarus. They state how every country dopes. Russia was caught and had a whistleblower that's it. I'm personally Russian and agree with the decision as much as it sucks, but just cause they're the only ones banned doesn't mean others shouldn't be
5 They are already here with the usual cries of "ButWhatAbout???"
2 News and forums in russian\on russian based communities are already filled with propaganda and damage control. It is sickening to look on really. Amount of normal, not paid people who genuinely "being patriotic" about this whole situation is huge as well. At this point this is beyond saving in just one generation.
1 HELLO FELLOW HUMAN. I AM HUMAN TOO.
-3 Did it reach the front page of T_ D yet? They must be upset 
-5 Будь что будет! 
-2 But what about the CIA bots?Ok, I'll see myself out...
18 Actually being punished?  They have increased testing from 700 tests in Salt Lake City to 1219 tests in Turin to 2149 in Vancouver to 2453 in Sochi.  Nearly all of the failed tests resulted in sanctions.  Russia has had over 100 athletes (more than any other country) who failed tests and all but one has resulted in sanctions.  Looks like they are stepping up their efforts and they do punish failed tests.  Not sure what "actually" is supposed to mean in this case. 
7 He loves ethics! He has the best athletes that would never dope!
4 Bigly
1 It's so good! I wish I could watch it for the first time again. Enjoy the trip.
1 No more than you can trust America.
1 Steroids are not marijuana dude. It's a very dangerous drug that leads to a lot of health problems.
1 But everyone doesn’t use government funds, government facilities, and government “anti-doping” folks to do it
1 Yea, but US doping isn’t state sponsored. I thought no that’s the important part here.
30 If it helps, no matter what happened Putin would have used it as a propaganda tool.
4 Fuck him. Nobody really takes him seriously anyways lol
2 Good. Fuck him.
4 > I wish we could offer them a carrot or Olive Branch somehowThey are. Russian athletes can still compete just not under the Russian flag.
-4 Don't be sorry. Will be fine. I appreciate Olive Branch gesture, but I don't appreciate meddling in my country internal affairs. Our governing bodies and oligarchs is our problem and none of your business.
21 waiting for them to blame Hillary.
1 Oh god I went in to see what's up and Jesus Christ it's like a Facebook for racist old white people
4 I just spit coffee on my keyboard asshole. 
-10 The fug does T_D have to do with this? 
1 Man is that place still a cesspool. The line between satire and crazy is pretty damn blurred. 
1 What does /r/the_Donald have to do with this? 
11 GET IMPALED VLAD!ftfy
1 “oh we know the russians could not be involve in election, do to simple fact the russian would not be caught hahahoho”these r-tards got banned from Olympics for passing piss through a hole in a locker room walland the are among the countries that still takes the olympics  super cereal
2 if you watched Icarus, you will understand that everyone has been cheating hard since forever, Russia was just dumb enough to get caught 
47 > Russians totally dominate ladies' figure skating right now.Yes, well, they cheat...
2 They'll still go. No Russia in the team trophy though. I wonder how that will work. Russia qualified 3 women's skaters. 
1 Maybe that Salt Lake situation where they exposed the judge fixing rings a bell?  The sport never got clean either. 
1 Russian athletes can still compete provided they pass a drug test and are approved by a panel.  They will compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia OAR.  The Russian flag will not be flown, they won't wear official uniforms, and the anthem won't play if they medal.  No Russian Olympic officials will be allowed to attend.
1 Figure skating is my favorite Olympics sport, and I don't think I've missed watching it in over 20 years (and I've seen a number of national and world competitions as well). I'm not an expert by any means, but I think I've seen enough to get a feel for how and why things are judged the way they are. I felt at the time that something might be wrong with respect to the figure skating results in Sochi. It was just kind of a gut-level sense. Enough wrong that it did cross my mind that maybe somehow Russia had fixed the competition somehow, not by doping (although maybe that happened too), but by influencing the judging. After watching Icarus and watching what has happened in the US over the last year and a half, I am now 100% convinced that something shady went down in Sochi with regard to figure skating. 
1 Nah. It's the opposite. Yay. They would stop funding those genetic freaks and start embezzling those money through building pools. Now instead of very costly picture of Russian flag on TV I will get a very costly pool. It's a win.
1 We did. The result runs America. Have fun. Seven more years.
17 "DISHONEST Olympics banned our good friends the Russians from competing over FAKE allegations of doping. TOTALLY UNFAIR! SAD!"
3 I'm interested to see what is going to happen with curling
5 The NHL isn't allowing players to participate in the Olympics.So really it'll be a bunch of AHL players.
5 Sweden vs Finland finals, calling it now. 
15 Gold won't mean anything with the shitty teams that are going to show up. No NHL players mean the level of skill is going to be so low compared to normal. 
6 Canada and the USA are going to be a disadvantage with the NHL not participating.  We might see countries like Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland actually being the top teams now, especially if the KHL pulls out too in response to this ban.
3 Canada wasn't winning anyways with no NHL players going. Russia was the huge favorite but not now.  Probably Sweden.
10 Himself. And only himself. 
-19 So have Americans.
-4 Yes evil evil Russia. 
1 let's apply to the same logic to everyone then not just to people/countries "we" currently don't like
2 Why would they care? Or anyone else for that matter? 
-1 What times have trump supporters defended russia for dumb reasons?
1 I'm not for any country I just feel bad for the athletes who didn't participate in doping and won't get a chance to take part in the biggest event they could aim for when becoming an athlete, and being an athlete is not exactly something you can do for a long time, another 2-4 extra years already can mean good bye to any chance at a top score.That's what irks me, and it's not like they can just leave Russia, I am from Russia and for the vast majority of people living there, it's far not that easy at all to just pack up and leave.Bummer. Real bummer.
-1 They can probably go as an independent athlete.
1 To be fair, the grouping this WC is actually really nicely spread. There is no single group of death.
1 Politically, as in they announce to the world they are displeased.
2 They just really bad at it apparently
1 Wtf? https://dxczjjuegupb.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Williams-vs-Sharapova.jpg. Hopfully USA will start the long overdue fully augmented Olympics. Where all drugs and prosthetics are allowed without recipe...
1 Those athletes will at least get to compete, so there is that.
1 Well it's fine, because they're looking into allowing the clean atheltes to compete individually the olympic flag.
1 They make other countries with questionable morals look better by comparison. That's honestly all I've got.
1 Shoot. Looks like most of the world messed with our election.
1 Nah Putin gave too much money to em 
1 That’s not what’s happening. Yes individual athletes here and there for almost every country dope. But Russia was encouraging it and running an entire scheme to help their athletes dope and not get caught, all during the games. 
1 It's Trump's fault, there.
-3 [deleted]
5 They can still compete, just not under the Russian flag.  don't need to feel too bad for them
11 All four of them!
30 FIFA corruption amazing???
13 Probably has something to do with the fact that FIFA and IOC are not connected in any way
18 How is it related? The IOC does not run the World Cup. 
0 Thanks for the recommendation that 100 other people have mentioned already. 
1 Yeah, it's not the US that is a massive sore. You don't invade countries for bullshit made-up reasons, you don't mess up entire regions, you don't mess with nuclear-powerful countries' elections, you don't spy on your friends and most certainly you aren't a slowly devolving police state with the citizens having to choose from a career politician and a reality TV show for the ruler.

8 "Putin, he's a great guy, love him. He's the best. This is a witch hunt on a man who has taken care of me since I announced I would run against Hillary. He doesn't deserve this." -Probably Trump
35 > Alright I'm just curious here. How does doping help someone in a glorified sled go faster?If you're talking about bobsledding, a huge part of it is the initial push-off where they push the sled down the ramp before jumping in.  Having stronger legs is a huge advantage.  Same with luge and stronger arms.
25 Bobsleigh athletes are all 100m sprinters,with a powerful push
57 It could help with concentration, focus, and strategy. That's part of the reason alcohol is banned as a performance-enhancing drug in shooting competitions. 
4 Many bobsleigh members come from failed 100m sprinters. Which was already doping. 
4 Bobsledders are generally sprinters that have learned to sled. The start makes the most difference barring a major mistake during the driving stage. There's a long history of doping problems with sprinters in track.
2 You've received a few replies but not a single one has touched on arguably the biggest advantage to doping --- recovery times.You can train harder, faster, and longer. It's a HUGE issue in fighting. When a BJJ or MMA athlete that is doping is able to train three or four times a day and someone clean is only able to train twice a day you can see how quickly a skill gap can develop.
2 I think you left out invading former Soviet states. I, too, wonder what's next though!
1 They're the only ones that seem to have state-sponsored doping. That's the difference.
1 People Said the gold Medal I won was the best gold medal eveer won by Anybody. The LYING democrats said I didnt go To the Olympics. FAKE NEWS!!!!!11!
1 One of their chief scientists detailed the entire plot with corresponding documents. Do some research.
1 Watch the documentary Icarus on Netflix
1 are you not enough the words from "gentleman"? You don't need proofs, while need to blame Russia. 
2 The article says athletes are allowed to complete as neutral non-country-affiliated athletes if they've submitted and passed all their drug tests
1 It's honestly just a really good documentary.
1 I mean, the problem in my mind is more than it has to be an all or nothing affair, and its unhealthy, so most nations won't want to do it.If its just Russia doping, then it doesn't make for a very level playing field. If everyone was doping and everyone was cool with that then sure, dope away.
1 Well, the ones who aren't breaking the rules did nothing wrong, there's no sense punishing them for something they had nothing to do with.
1 Nobody cares about Hockey. People around the world just care about World Football 
2 too much potato vodka to be rushin
1 Huh? Russia won 33 medals at Sochi, the most of any nation. Eleven of those have subsequently been stripped.
1 A documentary already exists: https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079
1 Norway dominated in 2014, if you discount Russia.
1 Russian athletes who are clean are able to compete.
2 IIRC it wasn't the doping in itself, it was the fact that it was systematic doping with officials hiding the fact they was doping that caused the giant controversy.
1 The Soviet Union was a highly corrupt dictatorship and Russia has never gone through a cleansing process by which those structures were eliminated. It has simply been reborn as a an oligarchy with the same level of corruption.
1 Performance enhancing drugs.  Steroid analogs, blood oxygenators, pain killers, stimulants and depressants depending on the event. Anything that gives a chemical edge, usually without regard for the long term health of the athlete.
1 I don't think you've followed this ongoing scandal very closely if you honestly believe this won't drive Putin and his boys nuts.
1 Canada still exists. We're screwed 
1 I mean, they're not gonna nuke the place with all the Chinese athletes and visitors there.
1 Let's put it this way, it's the same reason that you have redditors constantly spamming Russian conspiracy theories about Trump. It's all about denying reality because they're either afraid to fail or don't want to admit they've failed, they're so desperate to win they will literally use any tactic possible to get an advantage.
1 Even russians laugh on such a joke, how russian football 11 cripples "play". Don't be silly to believe that.
1 Here's an unsatisfying answer:Yes *but* Russia's soccer team didn't make the Olympics in 2016.  Meaning no one in their soccer federation, official or player, was implicated, and even if they had been, players on the U-23 teams that go to the Olympics are mostly not on the main men's national teams.  Also, Russia is hosting the 2018 World Cup and get to participate without even qualifying because they are the host nation.
1 The Sochi Olympics basically uncovered that the doping program for athletes was state sponsored and encouraged. So yeah, if your government is okay with disrespecting the rules and the spirit of the Olympics then your whole country gets banned. 
1 Ouch
1 Icarus is not the whole story.
1 Druglympics
1 And their "anti-doping labs" and their government sports officials and Putin himself.
1 Yes. In this case, the steroid use (and attempts to cover it) were systemic, coming from the Russian government itself. 
1 Essentially the FSB (the new KGB) had a state sponsored doping in Sochi.  To put it in context it would be like the CIA helping American athletes test negative by breaking in to testing facilities to switch urine.  Because that’s exactly what Russia did here.    
1 Damn near 80% of Russian athletes doped and the IOC found out
1 Systemic state sponsored
1 The nhl isnt taking part
4 If they do have a state sponsored program apparently they alot better at hiding it than the Russians
2 Because most other athletes dope on their own or because of a coach. Russia gets caught all the time because they sponsor it, they've had a record number 50 total medals stripped from them, the country behind them Belarus are at 11. That stat doesn't even count the number of athletes that haven't won medals.
1 The Chinese don't get caught.  Think of it as the espionage event in the Olympics.  
0 [deleted]
1 By that logic, we can either:- Allow everyone to compete knowing full well they dope- Cancel the OlympicsOr the IOC should at least try to repremand those who are caught.  
2 WE"RE BETTER AT DOPING! OUTRAGEOUS! ~Trump
3 it's trump. he would just make them wear russian uniforms.
2 Only countries that are really bad at the only sport that matters, World Football, care about the Olympics. 
1 So am I.
2 +100500
1 > it may be true...What makes you doubt the truthfullness of the story? You think Russia  didn't engage in systematic doping?>  still reads like CNN wrote it on their MacBook Pro'sCNN? It's the New York Times....>Starbucks in Down town Seattle while browsing the "used clothing" bins on Offer UpWhat? Why would they be in Seattle?> "Show of force using the olympics..." i mean COME ON"...the proud sports juggernaut that has long used the Olympics as a show of global force..."That's the actual quote... What's wrong with that sentence? I mean, come on....
1 Don't hate the people! They're suffering too. Focus your hate on the corruption/propaganda masters in charge.
1 We're doing the next one in LA and we've turned a profit the other times we've hosted so we're good
56 Okay. Show me another country who used their intelligence agencies to help their athletes cheat and then lie about it and also assassinate whistleblowers? I dare you.Russia is on another level of cheating. 
1 Fair point. If Russia, a proud sports nation with a population of 142.400.000 to select their athletes from and with active sports funding by their gouvernment, needs to dope their athletes to compete you can bet a lot, if not most, nations are actively doping, too.But what bad things are actively done to secure the doping system itself is a different question.
1 I think your right, I don't think it's to the same extent that Russia went too though 
1 You can always find the truth on Reddit at the bottom of the pile when you sort by 'controversial'. Only a dope does not how bad the doping problem in sports is.
1 Lol at all the Russian troll activity ITT. It's sad how they think people fall for this shit anymore.
15 Not so much of "mindless hate" but just decades of wars, murders, reprecussions, occupation and other fun things. Well at least for us, Poles.    If there only was some dope, German word to describe how we feel about Russians now :)
1 "Lol at all the mindless Russia hate ITT" they typed smugly, flipping to Fox news to watch Hannity lob softball questions to DJT between pizzagate segments.* "It's sad how easily war propaganda works."
2 I'm not sure what you're trying to say. One of Russia's top scientists flipped and detailed a massive government/FSB administered doping scheme that involved virtually all of their athletes. The IOC can't ignore something like that. Are other countries doping? Maybe. Is there concrete, documented evidence that those countries have been involved in a decades-long scheme of cheating? Not at this time.
14 The punishment is political because the crime was political.Yes, representatives from other countries do cheat, but when they are caught, they are punished individually. The difference here is that it wasn't the individuals cheating, it was the state. Russia sent agents to tamper with samples at an IOC facility in order to hide the doping of many of their athletes. Therefore the commiter of the crime, in this case, the Russian state, must be punished. That's why the state is banned, but many clean Russian athletes are allowed to participate under a neutral banner. The punishment fits the crime. 
7 Ah yes, the good old Russian deflection strategy: pretend other people are doing the bad thing and then claim "it's not bad if everyone does it"
20 No other country has ever had that kind of a massive, state-operated program to dope on that scale. It's not comparable at all to others doping
20 no. it's an ethical one. please prove that other governments make their athletes cheat
23 [deleted]
1 What other countries have a state sponsored doping campaign?
1 Can you give any prove of other nations plotting to cheat the next winter olympics?
1 What should they do instead?
1 Proof? There is plenty of proof about Russias doping. 
1 What would be the ethical move? I don't get what you're saying. Just because there's a possibility of other teams cheating, doesn't mean you shouldn't punish the ones who you catch. Should thiefs get off the hook because there's other people who steal and aren't caught?
-46 One single sane comment in the whole thread
-21 I agree. Everyone at this level uses doping. Russia has been made an example, propably because of political reasons. Not to say that Russia doesn't deserve some kind of punishment for the doping, but this is too radical.
1 > Russia should have their own OlympicsWith blackjack! And hookers! In fact, forget the Olympics!
-5 Electing Trump was definitely *dopey*, but not *doping*.
1 If that’s the case, then they need to be caught. Due process and all that shit. Can’t just point fingers and ban - there has to be evidence.
11 Are you saying the United States also had a shadow laboratory installed adjacent to the anti-doping lab in Sochi where they exchanged urine samples?
10 Has the USA implemented a state-sponsored doping program for its athletes though? No.
1 Then prove it.  
1 The US does not control the IOC
1 Well it was more US and EU leading the effort on this. Furthermore Russia had this done by the state. They literally had the FSB assist in covering up drug tests. I highly doubt that the FBI or Europol ever participated in this level of cheating. 
10 The rest of the world other than Canada and Russia?
24 Provide evidence and they will ban others. Please do not defend bad behavior by pretending everyome does it.
12 Provide evidence and they will ban more i am sure.
5 There is a huge difference between individual athletes doping (and often getting caught) and the state intelligence services and government abusing it's power to cover-up systematic state sponsored doping. 
5 Yeah they totally want to reduce viewership. That makes so much sense.
7 You clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about. This is not about isolated incidences of cheating. Russia had a state sanctioned program which required every athlete on the Olympic team to use PED's, and the KGB was secretly swapping their urine samples for clean ones for years. 
1 First of all, the Russian doping was state sponsored.  Second, the US controls the IOC?
1 The Russian individual athletes have already been banned for doping actually. This isn't about them as much as it is about the government sponsored and covered up program.
3 How is it unfair? 33 of their medals were doped athletes, that we know of. How else do you punish someone, or an entire fucking government sponsored scandal, for an event that happens once every four years. No way can they be trusted. They would just do it again. Just slap them on the wrist with a fine and say don't do it again?
1 Russia had state sponsored doping. It was suspected before, it's been proven now.
4 and the cleanest
2 Did you read the article? This wasn't the case of one individual doping. Russia literally set up a separate facility next to the anti-doping laboratory in Sochi, in order to replace hundreds of dirty urine samples:https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/05/13/sochi-doping/de19d9bedbf824974ca4f657d90cb653f0dc6859/floorplan-960.png 
1 Finally founf a bit of nuance buried deep down the page. All these reddit kiddies with there tribalism are the perfect substrates to propagandize the world into another world war. It takes a massive level of delusion to believe that the Russians are the only bad guys here, but these fools are ready to cast stones in glass houses. 
1 State sponsored being the key issue. Not that there aren't other countries doing that...
1 No but they are the only country that encourages it and runs an entire scheme to help its athletes dope and not test positive during the gamesCheck the documentary Icarus
-19 It's only bad if a country the US hates does it. 
1 It's never about what you do but what you get caught doing.
1 What are you even trying to say? 
1 and?
0 One of the reasons why Football is by far the best sport in the world it's because skills and hard work are the most important things... It doesn't matter how juiced you are. 
2 Its 2017.
1 Swimming and gymnastics are not in the Winter games :)
1 These are winter Olympics. No swimming
1 2018 is Winter Olympics dipshit
1 Wtf this is winter olympics btw
0 What would you have the US do? Lobs insults and start a world war over Facebook ads and Twitterbots? Please.
1 Can't speak for China but the U.S. is definitely not doing "the same shit". We dope, sure, but the state does not sponsor the doping.
1 This isn't about which athletes are doping, it's about which governments are intentionally doping their athletes
6 Because it's not about individuals doping. It's about a systematic doping program sanctioned by the government. There's a clear difference
-1 Man... you are so right, fu_king politics
1 Good robert
3 No it's pretty fair considering how ridiculously russia has been with doping so many of its athletes. Punishing a group for breaking rules isn't politics ffs. Russia having been allowed to keep completing this long was definitely political
3 Regardless of how you wish it could be, Russia broke the rules of the system and are banned for it accordingly.If the global community wanted to create a steroid olympics as a separate entity then that is its own issue, though the ethics of it are extremely questionable.
1 Russia has had a decades-long and very elaborate cheating program that was exposed on camera and in writing by one of their own top scientists. The program included the use of custom labs, FSB officers, scientists, and, of course, doped athletes. The IOC can't ignore all of that.
5 re-read the article
3 Was Lance Armstrong running on state provided doping program? Nobody thinks that russia is only country that has athletes doping, but this shit is state sponsored doping and just because sports are plagued by doping doesn't mean you should say it's perfectly fine for countries to sponsor doping.>Everyone is using doping, and this is just a symbolic gesture by the IOC.You should then post clear proof everyone is an doping in sports and something should be done about it. You must have mountain of evidence that will clearly show every athlete using doping. 
1 Russia won 33 medals at Sochi (13 gold, 11 silver, and 9 bronze), the most of any nation. It has subsequently been stripped of 11 of them due to doping.
2 > Disgusting commie globalist political bullshit to further isolate glorious RussiaAh yes, the good ol' communist IOC is at it again.> ironically its the biggest fucking country in the world"Ironically" does not mean what you think it does, given that the only category in which Russia is actually largest is physical area. It is only the ninth largest in terms of population and only the eleventh largest in terms of the size of its economy as measured by GDP.
-1 We both did yes
1 No, it's in South Korea. Russia is hosting the FIFA World Cup in 6 months though
1 There is no way to do that. They were virtually all cheating and required to do so as this was a state-sponsored program. Research what was going on. The FSB and Russian government were directly involved.
1 What does Yeltsin say about this
1 Shitstorm implies two sides.It's Reddit. Russia is evil, Trump will be impeached any day now, dude weed lmao.
4 They got caught though.
5 On an individual basis, but not as a National team. 
1 Only athletes that the IOC invites who have completely clean records so it will be a small portion of what would otherwise have been.
2 Because its not healthy. The Olympics represent among many thing health. This is not great for kids etc. Also many athletes dont want to do drugs. Its fair if all are clean.
1 Explain? Why wouldn't they be?
1 Hello I am a Nigerian Prince
0 The American team? 
2 You have to start somewhere when banning drug cheats. And Russia's cheating is incredibly well-documented. Please don't waste people's time trying to make excuses for cheaters who get caught. 
7 Any sport where focus is a requirement a.k.a any sport.
5 Skiiing absolutely, leg strength makes a huge difference in the amount you can train and the amount of control you have.  Not to mention all the new stunt-oriented moguls and halfpipes and ski-jumping, etc.  Cross-country skiing obviously it helps as well with strength and endurance.  Bobsledding and Luge both benefit from stronger push-offs.  Curling is the only sport I can think of where it wouldn't help.
4 Have you ever been skiing or snowboarding? All of the sports you listed outside of curling would absolutely benefit from doping. It may be less common in those sports, but it would absolutely help.
1 There really isn't much that can come out of his mouth (or Twitter feed) that will shock people anymore. 
5 No NHL players... So probably one of the scandinavian teams winning instead.
2 Not if Kurt Russell has anything to say about it
1 Thank you Gravitas, for making sure we frame all LGBTQ discussions on how it will affect a vestigial sports tournament.
2 Not yet if we do dope we do it much better than the Russians
4 USA doesnt have a state run doping program.
1 Then the richest (best research into making the best drugs) wins. 
4031 There are a lot of reasons.  Probably the biggest though is that it disrupts their regular season schedule and exposes their players to potentially serious injuries.  In some Olympics it's worth it for them anyways.  Like when it was in Canada, there at least weren't travel issues, and then it would have been a big headache for them not to participate in the Russian games given the Russian stars that make the NHL their home.  However, South Korea isn't as exciting a destination for the NHL.They tried to get some degree of compensation out of the IOC in exchange for their continued participation and didn't succeed in that, which led to the NHL pulling out.  Perhaps they'll be back in 2022 given that those Olympics will be in China and the NHL wants to grow the game there.
105 In addition to the season coordination issues, which have been long since understood and dealt with between the  league, the teams, and the players, the NHL is attempting to make their own international hockey tournament, and see the winter Olympic games as a threat to their new revenue source. So they're backing out of it to deligitimize the games by not allowing some of the best in the world to compete. 
47 NHL isn't allowed to advertise itself at the olympics so garry bettman barred the players from playing, its all about money and Bettman doesn't want to lose a few weeks of advertising $$
7 IIRC the NHL wanted rights to game footage as well and the IOC refused. They would be loaning players to a tournament and exposing them to injury with 0 compensation in return. 
2 A shorter version that has a key piece of information. NHL foots the bill for the insurance and takes on all of the risk of injury. IOC makes a ton of money from the Hockey and acts like they have the upper hand in bargaining. I prefer NHL players in the Olympics, but I completely understand why the NHL doesn't feel like doing all the work/risk for literally nothing.
2 The real reason is purely money for the NHL. It has **nothing** to do with scheduling or injuries.The NHL started their own "international" tournament called the World Cup of Hockey. It's strictly an NHL brand and I use quotations on international because they made an U-23 team and a Europe Team, so hardly between nations. Two gimmick teams at the expense of real nationalities. Did the owners care about injuries at that tournament? Nope.Did the owners care about scheduling conflicts and having a condesned season? Nope.But they'll use those reasons for their crocodile tears when they talk to the media about the Olympics lmao.
11 Because the NHL is greedy and don't want to lose money.
2 upvote for username
1 Sometimes pulling out is the best thing to do.
1 Because Gary Bettman is a fuckhead. 
1 Because Gary Bettman wants to grow the great sport of hockey. You want hockey to spread to countries and cities that hockey isn't very popular? Theres a global platform to showcase the best of the best hockey players to the whole world? Nah we don't need that. Oh players want to go and represent their countries in the olympics? Oh owners are willing to let their players go? Nah they can't do that. **FUCK GARY BETTMAN THAT SHORT LITTLE TROLL OF A HUMAN**
1 The owners didn't want their prize possessions to get hurt 
1 Because US players care more about the money they make in the national season than representing their country.
1 So the simple reasons that you'll hear from most places is that:1. Team owners don't want their star players getting hurt at a competition that they aren't paying them for.2. The NHL is upset that the IOC won't allow NHL advertising during the games.The *most* accurate reason though is because **the players want to go**. The owners want to leverage that into a bargaining chip at the next CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) negotiations - to push the next CBA-agreed revenue split (and other stipulations) further towards the owner's side.I have no doubt that the NHL players will be at the Beijing Olympics in 2022 - it's a huge untapped market for hockey (potential $$$$ for owners), unlike Korea. But the owners want to get something to give the players back Olympic participation.
1 Who needs the Olympic’s when you have the World Cup of Hockey (that the NHL owns)
1 Because the NHL is a shit league.
1 Because nhl owners don’t get any 💰💸
1 They started the World Cup of Hockey and don't want it to have a rival in the Olympics 
1 because owners
1 A lot of reasons, but injury and disruption of the NHL schedule are big ones. A few years ago the Islanders best player, John Tavares, suffered a season-ending injury in the Olympics. 
1 $
1 Owners don't want to run the risk of injuring their star players and lose out on all that sweet cashflow during regular season of NHL.
1 It sucks because players want to represent their country and fans want to see it, but how will the NHL make money if their players are overseas? They dont, and they risk their players (assets) being injured as well. It sucks, mcdavid and schiefele tore it up together at the whc I'd love to see that again.
1 I have watched no NHL this season because they pulled out of the Olympics. Before this barely missed a game!
1 Money.
1 $_$
1 Because billionaires don't like countries using "their players for free". 
1 The only effect here is that Canada wins with wider margin.
1 The best players make the Olympics. That means that teams would be playing season games without their star players, potentially hurting their standings. Also these players are now prone to injuries which would further hurt the teams for a much longer period of time.
1 Because the owners, and their fall-guy Gary "Lord Farquad" Bettman are pieces of shit who plan to use it as a negotiating tactic for the nezt collective bargaining agreement.
1 The IOC doesn't want to pay the injury insurance for NHL players. Which is understandable because the fees are astronomical in comparison to the other olympic athletes. The NHL and the IOC played chicken to see if someone would cave and pay, but ultimately neither did so NHL players won't be allowed to go. Some europeans have threatened to return to their home leagues so they would be allowed to play, but with the recent IOC ruling that is going to be a lot less likely.
1 It doesn't only happen with them but with most pro spots with tons of money on it.There's a reason why many NBA players don't go either, same happens with football (I mean soccer, not american football). Some players go because they want to but many don't attend because it's not worth it.
1 Because Bettman is a tool..
1 NHL owners want the IOC to cover expenses and insurance, IOC won't budge. Couple this with the already super demanding NHL season owners decided to play it safe and keep their players home.
1 Money.
1 Because my hammer already pulled me off.
1 Because they NHL doesn't make money off of it.
1 The Olympics are supposed to be about *amateur* athletes...*amateur* as in, not gone pro and signed multi-million dollar contracts... not *amateur* as in me trying to do.. well, pretty much any sport
1 $$$ with all due respect to the NHL the Olympics come every 4 years it shouldn't be too difficult to plan it out, and people injure themselves over pancakes so injuries are inevitable in a high paced sport. Now to defend the NHL it also should be realized that hockey can still be in the Summer Olympics the only downside is the best typically involve cup winning players so August is only 2 months after the Stanley Cup Finals, but those decisions are probably discussed with the NHL and IOC so hopefully they have a solution. 
229 I'm with you there.  I can see what the issues were for the NHL, but Olympic hockey with NHL players was amazing and I would have loved to see the likes of McDavid and Crosby against Kane and Matthews.
21 What is the reason for them pulling put?
3 Its not a done deal that they never will again. NHL players want to go, so it will likely be a point of contention in the next set of CBA talks 
1 > I totally get why, but those games were so fun to watchThis. Losing a franchise player for half a season due to an Olympic game would change a lot of opinions. We lost Tavares for half a season because of the Olympics and it was disastrous. I'll miss watching the games (the 2010 games were a heart-breaker), but the Isles are finally looking like the team they've always wanted to be...the possibility of injury is too serious for teams that will make a deep run for the Cup. 
1 They will be back in China.
241 Pros only started playing in the Olympics  a couple decades ago... it is an "amateur" event after all
35 You are so wrong! We will see great hockey. Lots of junior and college players , with points to prove.. NHL players, play hard but have to be careful because of their contracts. 
49 You don't need doping to make hockey exciting...
3 Just like weightlifting at London 2012 105 kg. 
1 I can't speak for others, but I would actually take it more seriously. I *like* watching the minnows play, if for the sheer novelty factor.
1 It will be like soccer.
1 Dude, the first couple of tournaments were just Canada curb stomping everyone. At least today even the junior level of hockey is competitive. 
1 So the only good sports are those played by pros? I think you've missed a lot of good games.
1 Millions of people every year watch the world junuors tournament. I'm thinking it's going to be a notch above that, so there's still hope.
1 [People got pretty worked up about the US hockey team in 86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice)
1 What are you talking about? The great Olympic hockey tournament was in 1980 when it was all college kids and armatures! Miracle on ice? Do you even watch hockey outside the nhl? 
1 sounds fun, I'm in
1 Are you on crack?!  The miracle on ice was in 1980 and was all college kids who beat out the unstoppable Soviet team. Everyone took them seriously. 
0 And how many of non usa can and russia are nhlers
62 It's always been about the curling imo.
28 > Are any hockey fans even looking forward to the olympics this year?Hockey is pretty much the only sport in the winter Olympics I care about, regardless of it's juniors or pros playing, so yup.
82 I'm sure that Russia was looking forward to this year's tournament prior to this ruling.  With the NHL out, Russia was the heavy favorite.  Now I would think that Sweden/Finland are the tournament favorites.
11 I enjoy watching the top division at my local amateur rink so, yes.  As long as the parity is good and the players are invested, I'm still looking forward to watching.It may not be "the best" as you say but a sport doesn't need to have full on stacked rosters to be exciting.
3 i sure am.  canada can still put together a great team, and it's more fun if there are more unknowns.
2 It will be fun to cheer on a bunch of rejects that haven't been in the NHL for years. The quality of play will be terrible, but I'll still watch Olympic Hockey.
1 I watch the world juniors, so yeah I'm excited.. I watch NHL all season, so some fresh faces will be good
1 Yes, the women's tournament will be excellent.
1 I am still excited for the Olympics as it is my favourite thing to watch bar none. Olympic hockey? I'm far less excited than before but I will still watch the Canada games.
1 I think it will almost be more competitive and entertaining now. As a Canadian it's fun seeing our team absolutely dominate year in year out but it also kind of sucks that our only competition is the U.S, Sweden, Russia and Finland. Even then when we lose it's really disappointing and we SHOULD win. There may be more parity now and maybe teams like Denmark, Germany, Norway, Switzerland  etc can be more competitive.
1 If you're a true hockey fan you'll watch. 
1 Obviously it won't be as exciting as if the NHL were participating, but I'm still excited to watch this year. I think about it this way: We're seeing guys who, for the most part, have never had an opportunity to play for their country at this big a stage. Guys who have been playing in lesser known leagues around the world now get the chance to become national heroes. As a kid playing hockey and growing up in Canada you most likely have 2 dreams: win a Stanley, and win gold for your country. So now it creates this unique situation in which guys who never thought they would be playing for olympic gold are suddenly thrust into the spotlight and playing their hearts out for their countries. We get to watch and endear ourselves to the stories that these guys have and cheer for them just as we would a normal team. And the thing is, these guys are still phenomenal hockey players. They might be a step or three slower than the NHLers, but these guys are still professional hockey players.  In other words, watching Scrivens and the boys in red and white go for gold is all I need in February
1 Well, I am somewhat excited, but that's the Canadian in me!But the excitement is obviously muted.Even if Canada wins again, it's not against the best players in the world, and therefore, a mediocre victory at best.Before, hockey was the most exciting part of the winter Olympics, now it's just a hockey game with team Canada in it. 
1 They'll care once NBC broadcasts the Olympics and blacks out NHL games.> What you probably are not aware of, however, is the NHL nevertheless will go dark across all NBC platforms between Feb. 7-26, during the Games. Last season, NBC and NBCSN combined to telecast 20 NHL games over the comparable period.> This is a network decision that several industry sources in touch with Slap Shots over the past two weeks interpret as nothing less than the league’s U.S. national television rights-holder giving a symbolic middle finger to Gary Bettman and the Board of Governors for withholding its players from one of NBC’s most important properties.
1 Not in the slightest. The Olympics were awesome because they were basically all-star teams but the players actually gave a shit and went all out. I know it used to only be amateur players, but that was before I was born. Plus, let's be real, none of these athletes are actually amateurs. They are all sponsored and training in the 4 years up to the event. Hell, volleyball is made up of all pro athletes. 
1 > I feel like if it's not going to be some version of "the best" competing then it probably shouldn't be included in the olympics.Exactly.
1 Exactly. Hockey has always been a big part of my life and I have no plans to watch. Especially with whatever the time difference will be. Crowning the "worlds best" and not inviting the worlds best. Lol great job guys.
1 I’m more excited than ever honestly, no players will be holding back and there will be more big hits and more passion than there already was! Young players have a lot more drive to succeed than dudes who already make millions. This will be a great proving ground for players looking to get drafted. It’s like how college football is better than the NFL 
1 I'm still going to watch it, it will still be good hockey, and bocott the nhl for that period. Losing the Russians is going to have a bigger impact on the women's hockey, I feel. In men's there's lists of good teams, for women's it basically comes down to Canada the u.s. and Russia.
1 I love watching Olympic hockey and the Juniors. The players are putting it all out there to get noticed and the games are still exciting as long as the team's are somewhat evenly matched
1 I mean, maybe it's different because I'm from MN and the 1980 Olympics are local legend for us. Folks in Florida or SoCal or Texas or whatever where they didn't have hockey until the NHL showed up might feel differently. But I'm *way* more interested in watching our college kids at the Olympics than watching mid-February regular-season NHL games while the league is taking its toys and going home.
1 In some ways I'm actually more interested than usual. Will be a neat challenge and there could be a couple of sweet underdog story-lines to follow. 
1 As a Canadian, it's basically the only thing I look forward to during the Olympics.
1 It's gonna suck. I feel like the Olympics in general are going downhill and fading in interest. There's not nearly as much hype about it this year it seems.Hopefully the audience is split though and the NHL takes a hit in the ratings. It would be nice to see the league lose money for doing this to hockey fans.
1 Hockey is hockey is hockey. I was incredibly disappointed when the IOC and the NHL couldn't come to terms, but as time went on, I've made my peace with the outcome.Over the years of NHL involvement, I had a hard time throwing my support wholly behind the US national team because my favorite players were scattered across so many countries. Sweden, Russia, Canada, etc. (Wings fan). So when any team won the gold, I was ok with it because at least some of my guys won. Now I predict I'll solidly be rooting for the USA regardless because I don't know anyone on the roster and I think it encourages me to just go full jingo in my support. All's not lost. The hockey will be exciting and maybe someday we'll get pros back. That said, the level of young stud talent in the NHL is the best it's been in a long time and it's a shame we can't see these kids shine in the Olympics. 
1 i am, now that russia is out.it's going to actually be a competition for all teams this time. I think Sweden will run away with gold though.I'm also stoked for the women's tournament. 
1 As a Minnesotan, of course I'm looking forward to Olympic hockey. The Xcel Engergy Center is sold out for the entire high school hockey tournament and that is as "amateur" as it gets, although some of our better high school teams could compete in earnest with college programs.
1 I'm looking forward to it more. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed watching my pro team guys play, but now it will be a totally new roster and a lot more difficult to predict.
1 I'm not looking forward to it, and I absolutely love Olympic hockey.
1 Women's hockey Is still a treat 
1 If QMJHL players are allowed I know a lot of Canadians would still be interested.
35 The NHLs pull out will hurt the USA just as much as Canada. The winner will be one of Sweden or Finland, as they have plenty of high quality talent in their own leagues.
10 Have you ever been to Winter Carnival in Quebec? Even middle school Canadian hockey is fun to watch!
2 I personally can't see the US competing with the Scandinavians.  
1 Well, without NHL and KHL, you guys have excellent chances to win the gold!
4 What a bunch of children. "Punish Russia for doping?!?!?!? We'll pull our Asia-spanning league!"
1 South Korea! I believe there are like 3 (former)Canadians and an American on thier team.
1 Yep, that's true.  Plus with the state of the men's tournament being what it is, the women's tournament might get more attention from the media.
1 As far as the minor leagues go, that's not entirely true.  There are some eligible minor league players, but many minor leagues aren't because they're signed to two-way contracts (that is to say, they signed a contract where they make X amount in the AHL and Y amount if they get called up to the NHL).  All players that signed that type of contract, which is a significant portion of the league and disproportionately the best players, aren't eligible.Also, there are a lot of European leagues out there, so countries like Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland are still in a decent position, perhaps a better one than Canada/America.
1 What do you mean by have a hockey team?  They field one for the games of course if they're going to participate in them.
1 Come on now, we’ll make new heroes. It’s still out sport.
2 The IIHF is trying to pressure the KHL into participating (or at leas they were back when this was all just a hypothetical scenario), but the KHL might pull out of the IIHF.  We'll have to see how this plays out though.
1 That was already off the table.  NHL players aren't simply being told not to go, they weren't eligible to participate following the NHL's decision.  So even if Ovechkin refused to play in the NHL for the duration of the Olympics, the Russians wouldn't have been allowed to put him on their team.  Before the season started, when the decision that NHL players are ineligible came out, Ovechkin acknowledged that he couldn't play, even though he was disappointed by that fact.
2 > I love watching Olympic hockey but now I feel like we've lost a lot of the elite players of the world.We have.  With the NHL out and now possibly the KHL as well, these Olympics won't have the star power we've seen in the past.  There will be talent to be sure, but these won't be the players that North Americans are used to cheering for.
2 In past Olympics, the national teams have been made up heavily of NHL players.  The NHL allowed this and even suspended their season to facilitate the Olympics.  This year the NHL has decided not to allow their players to participate in the Olympics, so the national teams needed to look elsewhere for players.  Now the world's second best hockey league, the KHL, might also be preventing players from going to the Olympics, further diminishing the pool of talent for national teams to pull from.
1 I think that's a fair point.  Russia looked like a heavy favorite to win.  Now it's a little more balanced, though I would still give the edge to the top European nations.
1 Players don't have the option if they're under NHL contract.  Even if they were willing to violate their NHL contract, Olympic teams aren't allowed to use them because of the NHL's decision.
3 Apparently the KHL is considering withdrawing from the IIHF and preventing players from participating in spite of the IIHF's pressure.  We'll have to see where that leads.
2 > They would have to severe that relationship if they wanted to ditch the olympics.Apparently severing the relationship is now on the table.  We'll have to see where that leads though.  There will probably be more dominoes falling over the next few days.
3275 And steroids.  Lots and lots of steroids.
62 The funny thing - they probably willA makeshift competition with Kazakhstan, Belarus and other ‘friendly states’ while thrashing an already empty budget
110 The Soviets did their own Olympics in 1984, it was called the Friendship Games and was there because they had boycott the 84 Olympics.  It's still a massive event in the gymnastics community, because it was the first time an American woman won the all-around medal. Only then, in the last decade or so, has video footage emerged from the Friendship Games, and when you compare the Soviet level of gymnastics with the American, well, we say that she has an asterisks next to her gold medal for a reason.EDIT for clarity: Sorry I'm a bit hungover lol. Basically the Soviets boycotted the games, and set up their Friendship Games. Meanwhile, at the Olympics, gymnastics was dominated by the Soviets so with no Soviets there an American woman won the all around. This was massive because she was the first American to win it, and the second American after her who won was in 2004. So when you watched that Olympics without the Soviets, it was a good standard of gymnastics and it was clear that the American was the easy winner. Then, maybe a decade ago, people started talking about the Friendship Games again and what the quality of gymnastics was like then. Someone went digging around and found the tapes of the friendship games (they're on YouTube now which is actually amazing because some of the gymnasts who competed at the Friendship Games had never seen themselves compete and now decades later they finally did) and when you compare the Soviet level of gymnastics in 76, to the American woman who won, well they were like two completely different sports. So in the gymnastics community now (or gymternet), when that American woman is referred to in regards to that gold medal, we often say she has an asterisks next to her name because she really only won after the Soviets boycotted. It used to be a kind of mean thing to say about her, but recently she has done some pretty shitty things so everyone is back on the "Mary Lou gold medal asterisks" train again.

80 I wonder if they would ever consider missing 2022 when it is being held by their neighboring country. 
105 Putin will win next 'elections' hahaha.
2 "election"
2 i understood it as the russian government threatening to forbid anyone that has any ties to russia be it a khl player or a russian born athlete wanting to participate under a neutral flag from participating.
2 > If Russia misses 2022 Olympics that a generation of ~~athletes~~ cheaters who got screwed.
1 Putin will do whatever he can to prevent the popularity of the athletic career path from diminishing.
1 >Popularity of that career path would diminish.Is that a bad thing? I hear lots of stories of olympic medalists becoming nobodies with no money a few years down the line. Doesn't sound like a career path worth pursuing.Although things could be different in russia - I'm not familiar with news  specifically about russian athletes.
1 No they didn't invite anyone but said there are paths for athletes to take to prove they hadn't done anything. They do have athletes in mind who they feel have tested a lot but they are still barred until further testing is done. 
1 I mean the obvious thing to do is crack down on cheaters, play fairly..... Is this not the obvious thing to do?
1 Many athletes can still compete for other countries. Isn't that notorious in several olympic ice skating competitions?
1 I don't think this will have any knock on effect on the Russian culture of the Olympics. Russia has always strived to prove that they are the best at everything since the at least the Cold War. That was literally the driving motivation behind cheating in the Sochi Games. Russia will miss one set of games two at most then they will be right back. My concern is how this will effect the development of sports like synchronized ice skating. Russia has been a leading force behind the top levels of this Olympic hopeful sport and without their backing it might not make the Olympics.
1 probably mean quit the IOC organization itself, which I assume means to no longer compete at the olympics as a nation.
1 > if they are willing to participate under neutral flagYou can bet on anything in Vegas right? I want to bet on how many top Russian athletes get Russian flag face tattoos. 
1 Just let the Russians compete under a flag with a giant syringe
1 Oh you will be fine. They were never going to allow Russias participation in the next winter Olympics after Russia screwed the world in the Sochi disaster. That would not send the right message. Unless maybe they'd have prostrated themselves for anti doping it would be a perversion to do so.  But I do not think they wish to ban Russia another time. Time heals all wounds. Russia will make some token effort towards anti doping and the ioc will be glad welcome them back. 
1 This man stating the facts here
1 Seriously though, even apart from Russia the Olympics have been corrupt for a long, long time. If the next scheduled Olympics does not happen because of corruption I will not be shocked.
2 That's 200+ athletes that won't be there, that's a lot of sponsorship and broadcast deals that won't exist. This costs the IOC too. It's not an empty threat.
12 It actually is. I.O.C. is loosing money, because now none of the Russian channels will be buying rights for streaming Olympics. As well as most of the tickets will be returned. It's not grand, but still in realm of millions of dollars.
2 “In Mother Russia, Olympics no ban you, you ban olympics!”
2 This strategy seemed familiar
1 Remember their counter boycotts?
1 LeGoat
3 I immediately thought of the same thing. Best roast ever.source: https://youtu.be/kqhVNZgZGqQ?t=179
1 It might also have something to do with the pallet of clean urine samples which showed up to the last Olympics for Russian athletes to use so they could pass the tests.  
141 What an absolutely crazy rabbit hole of a documentary.  I started watching with low expectations, and was blown away by the end.
1082 Here's the link itself to save someone 20 seconds: https://www.netflix.com/title/80168079
232 I didn't know what to expect going into Icarus, but wow that is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the way it all plays out is crazy
17 Icarus is an incredible film.  Absolutely loved it.
4 That documentary is amazing and disturbing. It really demonstrates not only the lengths Putin's people went to in order to unethically promote their athletes, but also the standard Russian govt MO for dealing with everything (lie, cheat, threaten, murder, obfuscate, deny deny deny, ruin reputations and besmirch characters, smirkingly make fun of whistleblowers, deny some more, fill the press with nonsense, and deny).
3 Magnitsky next!
3 If you American change that name to Edward Snowden. I bet you half of the american cheer because i fucked the Russians but Snowden did essentially the same and they will name him a traitor :/
2 Great fucking film. I learned a lot about the olympics and doping.
2 > It's nice to see a whistleblower actually vindicated.It would be nice to see a Russian whistleblower that doesn't end up getting irradiated.
2 > It's nice to see a whistleblower actually vindicated.And not tortured to death in prison.
2 I assume this means he'll have to live the rest of his life in witness protection? :( Hope his family made it out / isn't affected too much by all this
1 Vindicated?Hell, its nice to see a Russian whistleblower that hasn't been killed by Putin ... yet. 
3 If you American change that name to Edward Snowden. I bet you half of the american cheer because i fucked the Russians but Snowden did essentially the same and they will name him a traitor :/
1 Ink-ar-us  GADOOSH
1 It's also worth checking out Bryan Fogel's appearance on JRE where he talks about a couple of things not included in IcarusYou can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2FCBIpKCdI)
1 in the documentary, when the people from WADA started getting pissy with the guy saying "is he sorry?", it was so fucking vindicating when he put them in their place. Ya, he made a mistake working under a super corrupt government but literally risked everything to make it right. STFU 
1 Also Rocky IV
1 That documentary was exceptional - I thought it was an interesting topic but the actual film was riveting.
1 I just watched yesterday and what he sacrificed to get this info out is sad. Brilliant doco btw. 
1 Icarus was so fucking good! 👍
1 iirc didn't he leave his wife behind?  If so, I think now she needs to get out of Russia fast.
1 Bryan Fogel also did a great podcast with Joe Rogan. Highly recommend.
1 I love how it started out as a documentary about a dude seeing if he could beat his bike racing time after a year of doping.  Second half seemed like a completely different film.  
1 That's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Absolutely thrilling.
0 Only because he's exposing a Russian scandal, if it was the other way around the US government would want him dead.
1 I watched that movie when it came out, and i must say its an absolut amazing documentary and really thrilling and had me sit on the edge. Everyone should watch it - it also made me think if other big countries such as America, China or others do the same thing.
1 Pretty sure Trump is gonna pull the US out of the "fake"  Olympics now  ... Sad
0 I don't know, in Icarus, I think there was little to no critic of Rodtschenkow and they blamed it all on the system and the state. Author didn't really question it after half an hour.
1 > It's nice to see a whistleblower actually vindicated. Except when the whistleblow against the Democrat party, then they should be ignored and be forced to hide.
1 Yeah as long as he isn't whistle blowing on the USA.
185 It is pretty amazing what, IMO, Russia will go to to protect it's image. In the US, if something like this were to happen, I feel like some would be ashamed, some upset, others apathetic. From my view, however small, Russia wants to protect itself AT ALL COSTS, be it poor battle planning, sports doping, or candy crush high scores. 
26 WOW holy shit! I love the Olympics so much. I watch every sport (thank you DVR technology). Not every round of course, but I love the idea of the Olympics - bringing so many nations together through people with true passion for their talent. So many smiling faces during the opening and closing ceremonies. So much pride and happiness and supportive nations and families and cultures coming together and even the slight edge to it that the competitive nature of sport brings. I am sad for those who work hard who are held back by the political side, because the Olympics is a really nice, wholesome, wonderful way to bring people together from around the world. 
2 I was watching that movie where there are scenes of him just driving around with the director, or sitting alone in his living room, walking around in airports, etc... AS the news is coming out about Putin and his role with Putin, and all I could think was 'I would be fucking peeling my skin off if I was just sitting there, unarmed, with no protection like he is right now.'I don't know if he thought about that, or if the director did, but they should have been.  Even in the US.I can't remember them every referencing that thought at any point in the movie, but maybe they were behind the scenes and just didn't want to have that on film.  Who knows?
1 This is how you turn your own citizens against you.
1 > died suddenlyI think you mean murdered.
1 Died suddenly aka were murdered. (Putin's version)
0 How naive are all of you? Sacrificed a lot?! He didn't have any choice!He set it all up. He was the one masterminding the cheating. He was getting rich. He wasn't going to blow any whistle until 2 of his co-conspirators were killed because, gosh, maybe the Russians were cleaning house.He's not a good guy. He's a bad guy running away from even worse guys. He would've happily prepared the next Olympic doping rounds if he didn't figure out he was on a hitlist.
459 Grigory is currently in the U.S. witness protection program, probably being hunted by FSB agents on U.S. soil. 
181 He’s currently in protective custody in the USA. His wife/family are back in Russia.  They have taken away their money, interrogated them etc. Someone he worked with has already had a suspicious heart attack.If they don’t kill him, he’s never going to be able to live a normal life.
84 No country responds well with whistleblowers 
3 The whistle was lined with a rare lethal substance that could only be produced in 4 industrial sites, 3 of which are in Russia. Unfortunate mistakes, might want to look into those pesky Indians.
2 Polonium, it's good for the soul.   V. Putin
1 Such a great guy. He started this program. Was super proud of himself, bragged about it. When the shit hit the fan dumped his family in Russia like a coward and is now under protection. A coward that couldn't keep his mouth shut, that is all he is. Every country has their own methods of hiding doping. He just decided to talk about it.,
0 Didn't seem like such a great guy to me. He was super proud of how successful his cheating program was and had no issues with it until his ass got held to the fire. 
86 Absolutely, it also shows again that it often only takes one person to speak up to take down an entire system.Many people do things that aren't strictly legal or that are blatantly illegal in their daily jobs because they think that they won't be able to change anything anyways. Time and time again, we see that one person can be all it takes.
0 It actually was almost the opposite. His life was in danger, and he decided to flee the country to save himself, after two of his colleagues died from mysterious illnesses.
-1 Shame he forgot to get his family out as well. Edit. Fair play to the guy but he must have known what was going to happen to his family for embarrassing Putin.
1 Apparently his wife did not think it was serious enough to flee at that time. 
35 He went into WPP at the end of the documentary Icarus
1 They decided to stay. He wanted them to come with him. 
1 Have you ever seen downhill skiing!? There has always been a risk.
3 He fled to the US.
2 Guess everyone should avoid that. 
2 That's basically how deals with persecuters work. Criminals laying out the bigger picture for a reduced sentence.
2 If hes a criminal so are the people that ordered him to do this.  That is unless you expect people to believe that he personally had the ability to cause a major fsb operation around sochi 14'.Sounds like he is the criminal lackey of the criminal putin.  Thankfully he has a conscious, unlike putin, and decided to do the right thing, even though it means leaving the country of his birth, his wife and children behind.  Thats the actions of a man with morals.  Again, unlike putin. Did I mention that putin is a murderous piece of shit?
0 So he did a bad thing, realized it was bad, then worked with others to expose it and set it right again? There was a doping system. Don't try to pretend like this is an "if" senario.
13 He still does. Nearly every whistleblower was previously involved in the shady shit they uncovered. 
38 Are you not familiar with what a whistleblower is?
26 Without his testimony, records on the three hard drives he smuggled out of Russia, and the fact that he would’ve been killed by Russia, this would’ve all been swept under the rug. They would’ve never found out how the Russians swapped the urine in sochi and found the records of all the things taken by each athlete of it weren’t for him. So yeah, he deserves respect
33 Why? Do you think the average Russian is pro-doping?This isn't a betrayal of Russia, this is a victory for truth. 
11 > wonder what would lead one to betray their country like that. If I were Russian I'd hate him too.because your country is everything to you?
9 Really? So you think there is no possible justification to leak information about illegal actions committed by a country?I mean, I can somewhat understand people who argue that Snowden et al have endangered Americans but this doping case seems to be pretty 'positive' all around.What about Staufenberg's assassination attempt on Hitler? 
0 If you honestly believe that Rodchenkov telling the truth is betraying his country, you have some disturbingly questionable morals. For context, I say this as an American who thinks Snowden is a hero.
545 This is exactly in line with what their propaganda machine is churning out every day on the news. The evil Americans and Europeans are conspiring against Russia to destroy it, and we must unite as a country to not let them win. Putin is our strong and worthy leader, and he will protect Russia with all his might. Everything is a conspiracy. Every news article from the west is fake. Every protestor is hired. Nothing is real. Russia is the last true stronghold of civilization.My wife is Russian, and it's just impossible to discuss anything remotely related to politics without her dragging up insane conspiracy theories. Russia had, and still has a lot of troops on the ground in Ukraine, right? Russian soldiers have disclosed a lot of information on social media about their presence there, and journalists from around the world have reported their presence. The local inhabitants have made thousands of videos of Russians soldiers. Something must be going on there, right? WRONG!! It's just fake news from the West.On Russian news, they report the war in Ukraine as the Ukrainan army killing and oppressing Ukrainian citizens who dares speak up, or has Russian ties. Then they do big segments where they are showing neo-nazi, anti-russian rallies in Kiev (with like 40 people), to prove that the Ukrainians are the real bad guys. Then they run WWII documentaries about that time when the Russian army liberated Ukraine from the nazis. Damn, what a shame that the subhuman Ukrainians are not grateful for everything that Russia did for them!
11 *pompousAnd its spelled "pedantic", in case you were wondering.
2 It's not going to be all propaganda. A lot of people will think this is not the right decision for different reasons and without being influenced by the Russians. Just a few days ago a well-known sports commentator in my country spoke out against a potential ban, mentioning the hypocrisy of this. He claimed that lots of athletes used doping during the games in Los Angeles and Beijing, but no bans every came from that. He is notorious for his anti-doping-investigations sentiments though.
1 Or they'll just bribe the IOC members better.  
1 My good friend is Russian.. She think's the west just loveeeesss to blame Russia for anything. There's no reasoning with her. Putin and all those involved seem to buy their own bullshit. Originators of fake news I guess.
1 > rather than growing up and acting as a responsible world partner. Like what happened after the fall of the USSR with the capitalist vultures?
1 It's like they never even watched the fourth Rocky movie.
1 lol what a rich statement.Is now the West's fault that Russia has a state sponsored cheating and corruption program? Seriously?
-24 You and the person above are incredibly naive. Every olympic athlete is on PEDs, every single one.This is a very weird decision actually.
0 > Unfortunately, Russian officials are already playing the propaganda game on this one.FДKЗ NЗЩs!  FДKЗ NЗЩs!  FДKЗ NЗЩs!
0 Russians and propaganda? While I never!
1 Yeah this is like Harvey Weinstein saying " I need help not judgement". 
1 dude: USA IS manipulating the world.
11 Exactly this. I get that everyone wants things to be "fair fair fair", but to what extent do you go to be fair? Some people have higher levels of testosterone, so they're going to perform better. Is this fair? Some people live at higher altitudes, so their lungs work better absorbing oxygen. Is this fair? Some people's genetics are simply better than others.Furthermore, with designer drugs and methods of doping, its just impossible to police. You can run a test cycle for years, beefing up and getting huge, then just stop a period of time before the games and you'd be "clean". Does it matter if you used anabolics to craft your body into a machine as long as you aren't on them for the games?I understand it needs to be banned so it doesn't encourage it and have people harm themselves, but banning nations is silly. Every nation and every person takes some sort of performance enhancing drug. Fuck, CAFFEINE is a performance enhancing drug.  Where are we arbitrarily drawing the line? The olympics isn't stock car racing, where every car is exactly the same and it comes down to skill, no. Peoples bodies are different, so its never truly "fair" in the sense that the kenyan runner's genetics makes him prime for running a hundred kilometers.Doping shouldn't be encouraged, but things like testosterone or other hormones shouldn't be a bannable offense. You may as well ban serotonin, dopamine, or red blood cells for that matter.
235 Not all of them, only those that get approval:>Those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. 
672 That seems like it would be a significant slap in the face to such a nationalistic country.
14 Only those who can prove a history of no doping is what the article says. 
36 ... Russia is still banned. You can't see why maybe they'd be a little upset by it all?
27 Those caught doping obviously won't be able to compete, but there's no reason to take years of training away from an athlete that did nothing wrong. Russia as a country was banned from the Olympics because they had a state sponsored doping program.
2 They are only allowed to compete if they have a history of extensive drug testing.  Not sure who makes this determination, but I imagine this will prevent a number of athletes from competing.
2 Select individuals will (most likely) receive special dispensation to compete. They won't all be allowed to compete.
2 The point of state sponsored doping is to show that country as number 1.
1 How does that work?
1 What anthem would play if a 'neutral' wins gold?It feels like playing the silver medalist's anthem would be an extra slap in the face.
1 I'm glad that the athletes who weren't doping are going to be allowed to compete.
1 How so?
1 So if one of them wins gold in an event what flag flies & what song plays?
1 There's a strong possibility that Russian athletes who choose to go to the Olympics under a neutral flag will wind up shunned by Russia afterwards.  At this point, it's personal for Putin, as evidenced by what is likely to come from the KHL tomorrow regarding hockey participation.
1 I highly doubt there will be any Russian athletes attending under any flag. If Russia would comply with the IOC they'd basically admit to their wrongdoing. Instead, it can be expected Russia will boycott the games entirely and forbid any of their athletes to partake.
1 Only the athletes that pass stringent testing for doping.
1 No way in hell are they competing. Unlike in US, Olympians in Russia are heavily subsidized by the state. Russian officials have already stated their intention to boycott the games if today's decision was passed. Any Russian athlete who would dare to defy the boycott would risk losing tons of money and potentially future employment. There are might be a few random exceptions to this but as a whole I'd expect them to be largely absent from the games. 
1 Don't a lot of athletes already compete for countries other than those of their citizenship?A "national team" is coming to mean about as much as a "city team" means in major-league baseball.
1 I thought that those competing under a neutral flag were not part of the doping program though. 
1 I don't think any athletes will be allowed to go.
1 Competing without region, or whatever you want to call it, is still a massive impact to the games.
1 No Russian will do that. They have respect for their country. They've already started the hashtag #norussianogames on instagram
1 > But they're still competing, just not under the Russian flag.Its an authoritarian country - if Putin won't let them they risk their and their family's lives if they try to attend.
0 Good point, It'll be under the Ukrainian flag
0 because this isn't about doping. Its about the what the media wants us to think about Russia. Go read some articles from the athletes perspective.
-9 But that's even worse I think. The athletes were the one that fucked up. They should be the one receiving the punishment, not the country. They should have been those athletes instead of the country. 
0 Can you point out some scientific sources to back what you're saying? 
-1 DOesn't have to be danger but they are unfair and destroying the natural competitions of abilities of each athlete. However in Russia and China it's organized, government run program to enhance results of their athletes, that's why it's deplroable and should be punished harshly like now. Chinese gymnasts have been falsifying their age to be able to compete in older groups. That's clearly against the rules.
2 From the paralympics, I believe. 
27 /r/synchronicity 
9 I hate that all these organizations who should be doing great things are instead corrupt to the core. FIFA is another example.
1 Joe Rogan did a podcast with the guy that made Icarus about a month ago.   Was really good
1 I've never completely understood events in which winning was open to a judge's interpretation. It's probably the same reason why I was never too keen on American Idol or The Voice.
1 > I don't know which is more corrupt, the Olympics or FIFA.FTA:>"Vitaly Mutko, ... Russia’s top sports official during the 2014 Sochi Games and ... directly implicated by Dr. Rodchenkov. As part of Tuesday’s ruling, Mr. Mutko was barred for life from the Olympics.>Mr. Mutko is also the chairman of the local organizing committee for the World Cup, but FIFA said in a statement Tuesday that the **I.O.C.’s punishments for Olympic doping would have “no impact”** on its preparations for the tournament, which begins in June."
1 It's a rogue state. 
1 Just recently hundreds of Fake accounts [like this one](https://i.redd.it/290j3wlge6201.png) on social media were exposed as being Russian accounts in an attempt to influence politics. It's not a stretch to believe that this is happening on reddit too.
1 I believe that Russia is likely the only (large) country that had a government supported system in place to allow their athletes to get away with doping. There are obviously individuals from every country who will take advantage of any opportunity gain an edge, but don't have the support of their government to do so.
1 Right... Russia got caught and the IOC still let them participate in the 2016 Rio games. Show me another example of proven state sponsored doping from a country comparable in size to Russia. You can point fingers at China, but there's not enough evidence there. 
6 huh?
473 I'm going to suggest that everyone also watch *Lady in the Water* by M. Night Shyamalan.Doesn't have to with anything I just know that's a movie you haven't seen in a long while and it's an okay movie.
84 If he dies, he dies.

4 AND HE STILL LOST USA!! USA!! USA!!! 
1 He also AK 47s an entire bar of people for literally no reason
1 I must break you.
1 Apollo's blood is on Russian hands!
1 Yah but to be fair he had to just so he could mount that blonde girlfriend of his. 
1 Yeah, screw Ivan Drago! 🇺🇸
1 They should also watch the 2016 US Presidential Inauguration. 
1 I know, he had a male girlfriend dressed up like a manly woman!
1 I fight to win, for me. For me!
15 I am a boxing fan, don’t even get me started about corrupt Boxing refs in the Olympics. http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-oly-rio-2016-controversial-decisions-lead-to-1471450461-htmlstory.html
1 I mentioned this a few other times in this thread, but I have always suspected that something was wrong with the figure skating judging at Sochi as well.
1 What happened?
1 What were the names of the referees?
1 If they didn’t, they should have, because it’s absolutely laughable to me that anyone would think most top-level athletes are natural. I can’t find it now, but Joe Rogan did a podcast interview with an Olympics coach years ago explaining just how easy it is to beat the drug tests, and that arguably the tests are designed to encourage this kind of cheating. 
12 Wait, are you saying that the other countries simply had the better athletes and genetic pool to perform better than Russian with steroids? /sarcasm
1 i think you missed the point of the ban. athletes across many sports and nations dope and cheat. but as far as we know russia (and according to rumors, china) are the only nations that have state sponsored doping programmes for propaganda purposes.
4 Its not about being clean, its about not getting caught.The best aren't caught. This is unfortunately true for everything.
3 Don't know if all but most of them yes. There are not many countries who have state sponsored and organized doping program.
1 хорошо!In all seriousness though I'm far more interested in drug abuse in Football than I am in the Olympics. There was lots of news stories about many teams being found guilty of drug use in the Premier League either early this year or the end of last year and still nothing massive has came of it.
4 Haha, I actually watched the documentary after listening to the JRE episode with this documentary’s director.
13 Most of them probably do. Only in this case it was state sponsored and involved their intelligence agencies to cover it up, which adds a whole new dimension to it.
12 Olympic athletes are drug screened a lot. Some definitely dope but not all.
4 Only certain athletes are being invited by the ioc. They dont decide who goes
1 If you have some free time then watch this podcast that Icarus’ director was on: https://youtu.be/P2FCBIpKCdI
1 I don't think after this even God would save him, let alone US authorities.
1 [Relevant SNL skit.](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/update-all-drug-olympics/n9691?snl=1) Sorry it's not YouTube but it's not on there.
1 Ah yes, the infamous Clinton body count. 
302 I really hope Blizzard uses this opportunity to make a Zarya skin with a neutral uniform
107 I'm glad they get to compete, but one part of me feels bad for them. A lot of the Olympics is national pride and being able to represent your country, and competing under a neutral flag does lose some of that aspect of the Olympics.
3 Can they change the flag or at least the music to something else? Like I'd want the music from the end of A New Hope
2 Epyx flag is best flag
2 Guilty until proven innocent it seems.
1 Assuming Putin lets any of those athletes leave the country to compete in an olympic games where they can't represent Russia. Russia will probably host its own games similar to what they did in 1988(?). 
1 There are 0 proven clean athletes.
9 If someone is profesionally competing at a sport that is even moderately popular, you should almost always assume they’re doping.
1 You clearly don't follow the Olympics. 
31 No. No Russian anything, teams or individuals. Edit: they can't form a team under a neutral flag
1 I would imagine the KHL will probably block their players from going even if they want to and are clean in protest of this decision
227 He's also been successfully gaslighting the shit out of America. Russia looks better when their peers appear worse.
43 If a country's strength is measured in the buzz they generate then we'd look at North Korea and Iran as world powers, so there is a distinct difference there.
16 The main strategy seems to be not to make Russia stronger but to make everyone else weaker through misinformation and destabilization.  This technically improves Russia's standing on the world stage while doing nothing to actually help Russians.  
1 Weak hand? Russia has all the resources. All it needed was to banish oligarchs, develop better human resources (education) and differentiate the economy. All Putin did was an end to the chechnya conflict. And you know how he accomplished that? Bribe. Billions of dollars are wasted every year just so Chechnya would remain pro-Putin. They don't invest the money, only spend. It has highest unemployment rates in Europe. This place is a fancy shithole. And the fancy part comes only because of all the money being pumped thereEssentially, Putin had 20 years and he accomplished nothing. With all the horrible things Hitler did it looks like he actually cared for his people. Putin doesn't. What he cares about is money and remaining in power
3 Who's to say they're weaker for it? They may have lost some, but still had  a net gain for it. 
1 Win win
1 Its impossible to have a weak hand if you possess the largest nuclear weapon stockpile in the world. Even if that is your only good card.
-1 Well if you count them invading another country and then annexing a large, economically vital part of it, or influencing, manipulating and actually succeeding in deciding who runs the United States, I'd say they're pretty damn strong at the moment. How all these strong arm, underworld tactics play out in the long run is to be seen but Russia's leverage proves to be a powerful adversary or, if you're the President, BBF.
19 > There's never been a time it wasn't like this, unfortunately. But it was moving in a better direction and it has gotten A LOT worse lately.Progressive journalists, LGBTQ-people, etc, have a much harder time in Russia now than before. It was never good, but it is a lot worse.Also, the general media exposure is more propagandist than ever and a larger portion of the general public is more firmly dedicated to the world view that Putin etc are pushing.
23 Actually Russia's system has been all the way from the tsars to now based on a very little number of people possessing most of the wealth. So nothing new on this side.And someone would argue that if you look at the big picture it's pretty much the same everywhere else. But the scale in Russia is indeed staggering.
1 How the heck did Yeltsin even get into pow- [Oh wait...](http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960715_400.jpg)
4 Russia has never really been a big winner as far as governments go. 
253 Me too, but I doubt it. Putin's been getting away with shit like this for decades. 
71 Actually this is a pretty good outcome for him. The current narrative is "the West is doing everything to undermine and weaken Russia". The ban fits this narrative pretty well and will probably fuel another wave of "patriotic" propaganda.
128 The Olympic stuff? Nah. He's only getting more powerful. Additionally, the power structure is so corrupt from the top down that even IF Putin was unseated, he would be replaced with a good pal of his.   
3 Never.Be ready to see him as president of Russia till his death. Whatever way it should happen.
3 It's not. His message will be that the outside world wants to punish mother Russia again because they can't allow them to win, or something similar, and propaganda is still very strong in the country. Also looking at other world countries (I'm looking at you USA, but also Italy) I have the impression that the tendency is more in favour of Putins types of leaders, populist and corrupt, than the opposite.
2 He will simply use this. "Look at the West with their russophobia, let's unite around our great leader" and shit like this.
2 The sad thing is that this keeps pushing his narrative that the rest of the world is out to do bad things to Russia and feeds into the nationalistic worldview they are pushing.The rest of the world couldn't accept that Russians beat them so they fabricated this doping scandal.This just furthers the isolation and diverging view of the world for Russia and its population. Imagine if Fox News was the most balanced news you were exposed to, how would that shape your view of the world?
2 For some reason I don't think a guy who has tilted American elections, annexed portions of his neighbors, openly supported dictators who has their own people, murdered political opponents with polonium, and who targets neighborhoods with with phosphorous being affected much by an IOC ruling. If this is what you think will bring Putin down, you haven't been paying attention. 
1 Not sure how an Olympic ban will have any effect on Putin’s standing in the government, but yea I️ hope he’s not around for another 20 years or so like it seems now 
1 Lol an Olympic ban? I’m sure this will unravel his rule. 
1 What on earth could this do?
1 It’s the end of the beginning 
1 Not a chance. This will only bolster support for him. 
1 Wishful thinking I’d say, he’s more powerful than ever. I fear that the end of his reign will probably come during a pretty scary time for all of us 
1 No way.  Half the population idolizes him as bringing back the good old days and the other half is either too poor and sick to pay attention or to terrified to do anything.
1 With the Magnitsky sanctions beginning to bite he could really have used a few gold medals to help booster his popularity.  The good thing is that when his popularity falls because of this he may panic and do something heavy handed and thus hasten his end. The bad thing is of course that if he does do something heavy handed it will almost certainly involve lots of bullets and many good Russians will die.
1 Go on, try it, you king of burgers, last thing you'll see when trying to remove him is a nuclear mushroom in your window.
1 Fuck you. Russia ain't going away.
1 putin is still very popular in Russia
76 Olympics ARE NOT trivial. I don't care how much a person doesn't care for sports, the Olympics have been a huge event that hundreds of millions if not a billion people watch or keep track of. They are a big part of history and the world being able to come together and compete against each other. It brings immense amount of patriotism and support from around the world. To top it all off, the amount of money put into something like this gigantic, it is anything but trivial.
1 And this is the reason why many people still love people nowadays in Russia; he brought stability after the 90's which were years of anarchy and for that many people who lived then are still gratefull.
5 Yes, but what good did he do?
1 There are decent alternatives to Putin, but he gets most of them assassinated... Wouldn't it be great if Russia could cooperate with Europe and the rest of the western world under the leadership of a young, capable, fairly elected president?
26 It was just coming out of a ruinous Communist dictatorship that lasted 70 years, of course it was in bad shape. Plus, the price of oil was low.
3 There at least was a hope for better future.
3 His government did it, it's as simple as that, he can plead ignorance but that is a pathetic excuse that no one with half a brain should believe and even if he was unaware that is almost as bad, it means Putin was unaware of what several high ranking members of his government and intelligence services were doing. 
3 Yes. 
-2 no, people just like using him as someone to blame all the time
-7 It's Reddit, he is now personally responsible for everything that redditors feel is wrong in the world.
3 Hitler and Pinochet improved their economies too
1 They reduced from tens of thousands to a couple thousand, which means squat when a single one could fuck the planet.
2 Which sanctions got lifted?
1 You mean America who single handedly destablized a whole region?
6 The USSR was far more of a world power than Russia is now, how young are you?
8 TIL the USSR wasnt a world power....
7 Bahahaha "world power" sure. How is their blue-water navy holding up, is it able to project power to any ocean in the world? Oh wait, that's right, they don't have one. They have a single carrier that has to be lugged around via tugboat. 
7 The fuck....Russia WAS a world power for those 70 years. It was a superpower, ffs. Putin's Russia is little more than a pale shadow of that.
0 Yes great job propping up a dictator, helping him destroy his own country and exacerbating/prolonging the Syrian refugee crisis. C'mon man. The guy's a piece of shit.
5 Maybe they just switched them with other tamper-proof containers?
1 I agree with glorious patriot from important US of country. The illegally swapped clean urine containers tested negative! 
205 I can't wait to see Trump come out and denounce this decision on behalf of Putin
3 I agree with banning a country that clearly has a lot of issues with cheating in the Olympics, however, I don't know how I feel about using Olympic bans on nations, in such a way that the athletes can compete but not under their country's flag because of political reasons. Then again, what they did at Sochi was absolute bullshit and definitely deserved a punishment. 
1 What's sad is that in theory Putin could admit that 'yes, we were wrong' and let innocent Russian athletes compete under the IOC flag, but I'll eat my theoretical hat if he does that.
0 Putin will not be infuriated by this one bit. It works into his plans.This is fantastic marketing for the Russian government. They get to tell the Russian people that the rest of the world doesn't want them around. It could make the Russian government look bad, but the Russian government is at least there to console the Russian people when the rest of the world turns their backs.The IOC could have just penalized each Russian athlete when they were found for doping. Instead they banned the Russians as a whole. This probably won't seem like proper justice to the Russians and will thus reflect poorly on the Western countries. It also delegitimizes the IOC as an international authority.You need to remember that there is more at stake here than walking away with a bunch of gold medals. Putin was KGB, the most feared organization in Russia, and one of the most feared in the world at the time. He knows what matters to people, and sports come way down the list behind life and prosperity.The Olympics is a rather meaningless competition meant as a diplomatic event that brings countries together around games. Keeping Russia out is a huge mistake for Europe and the US. It will only enrage the Russian citizens and divide our common bonds.
40 I'd say a good amount, actually, here is an exert from an article:"But their relationship took a bizarre turn in November 2015, when news reports alleged that Rodchenkov was a key figure in Russia's state-sponsored doping program during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Fearing for his life, Rodchenkov fled to the U.S. with Fogel's help and confessed on camera that he oversaw the swapping out of hundreds of athletes' urine samples during the Sochi games. "Fogel is the filmmaker. While I do not know the exact extent in which he "helped" Rodchenkov escape. He certainly played a role in helping not only protect the whistleblower to get him out of the country, he also helped to shed light on the entire controversy.I'd say it was an important factor from what I've read/seen. Pretty amazing stuff in my opinion, I'm super happy SOMETHING has been done finally after all the facts came out.
1 Some folks in the West like to think that we're all backward savages that blindly support the stuff that comes out of the Kremlin.  
11 Russia has been doing it longer and with government support/obfuscation.The USA punishes their own for cheating because we hate the idea, so if it does happen it's rogue coaches and athletes - not a coordinated investment.China, Russia, Kazakhstan, North Korea - all cheat because they feel like getting away with it is half the competition unto itself. Completely different moral stances.
22 Defending Russia's actions by saying other countries do it too... now where have I heard that argument recently?
1 People from every country cheat....but Russia is the only country that cheats. 
1 A generalization that gives zero credit to the issue being discussed.
1 Really ? Show me another country with a state sponsored doping program that encompasses nearly all their athletes, with surreptitious techniques of handling the cheating, and using their hosting privilege to do so. Go ahead, I'll wait for you. 
1 > Mate almost every country cheatsWhich should make it very easy to prove your assertion!  Just link the stories of state sponsored cheating.
3 I respect the fictional versions of Putin created by Slightly Left of Centre and Peter Shukoff. The real one can kiss my American ass.
1 I bet you’ve been many times and are very informed in your opinion.
-2 Slimy Russians gonna slime. 
-5 There are plenty of other things in this fine country, calm yourself down.
-4 There was a hunter guy whose guns got stolen by a bear from his hunting cabin when he went for a drink. Upon the discovery of the theft, he did the sensible thing and spent a few days in the forest, alone, looking for the bear bearing his arms. How can you not respect that?
-6 Respect? Never. Fear? Definitely 
47 [Nuetrapolans unite!](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/true_neutral_embassy_1933.jpg) 
4 What about team sports? Someone said they can't form teams under neutral flag.
2 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Flag_of_Switzerland_%28Pantone%29.svg/2000px-Flag_of_Switzerland_%28Pantone%29.svg.png
3 They'll probably have to compete with the financing of the neutral country they represent. Though I also heard Russia already developed the athlete equipment without Russian symbolic.
2 > That is, if Putin lets them and doesn't try to boycott or something.IOC: "You're banned from the Olympics"Putin: "You can't ban us! ~~WE QUIT~~ We're boycotting!"
1 Letting the athletes compete would be an admission of guilt - would be very surprised if Putin does that.
1 but russia
1 > Ben Johnson was a Canadian sprinter.   
2 Germany hosted the Olympics, not the Nazis.And it was 1936. Pre-war.
0 Maybe Putin's not as good at covering up his Holocaust 
1 They even let them cook dinner.  They made Jewburgers. OMG I am sorrry!
1 Hitler's antisemitism and expansionist plans had been known long before the nazi's became the global enemy.
2 And needing to cheat to win *isn't* dishonorable?I think it's *more* dishonorable. Far more. Any culture where that's not true is one I consider fundamentally morally flawed.
-2 It's called a joke, yo.
6 That Hitler sounds like a stand-up dude
1 I mean *for the country,* not for the athlete.
2 And it's pathetic that they are in such dire need as to cheat on an institutional level to get it.
18 The issue with Russia's cheating was that it was a systemic, state-sponsored program facilitated by the government.I feel like you have a chip on your shoulder, judging from the rest of your commentary.
8 Everyone does not cheat. Show documented evidence.
1 I think the problem here was that it was a systematic doping program setup by the Russian govt. It’s literally like the FBI using its resources to help US athletes cheat. Although I wouldn’t put it past Trump to try to do something this stupid.I don’t disagree that many athletes take performance enhancing drugs, but it seems in this case the Russian government is involved. In other countries it seems to be a more personal matter with the athletes, coaches, & doctors doing it without any direction from the government.
1 Or you know... the guy who was responsible for it actually called them out on it?
1 > Nobody knew what the Nazis were doing in 1936.Anyone who read the book knew what the Nazis were about in 1936.
1 Russia isn't being punished for their athletes' doping.They're being punished for doping their athletes.
1 How closely do you follow these sports? Evgenia Medvedeva is an honest athlete with a clean record. She was 14 when this all went down and couldn’t even compete at a senior level. She’s badass. She doesn’t dope.  She deserves to go to the Olympics and I hope Putin lets her go independently.
3 Especially considering all of the other competitors committed suicide right before the finish line
1 Hillary opening a can of pickles was pretty suspicious.
1 You're ACTUALLY Trump pretending to be a random pretending to be Trump, aren't you?
1 You don't think:1. This is related to Russia's overall international identity?2. That we live in a world where this response could possibly happen?3. That he will probably issue a comment at some point?
1 I remember reading some articles after I watched Icarus that basically said they didn't know *what* they were taking. Like [this article says:](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/09/russian-athletes-admit-taking-banned-substances-grigory-rodchenkov-2014-winter-olympics)>The anonymous athletes told Match TV, Russia’s biggest sports channel, that the substances were supplied to them by Rodchenkov in unmarked pill containers, dissolved in the mouth and washed down with alcohol.>“They weren’t to be used every day but whenever I felt I was tired, so as to speed up the recovery process,” one of the athletes told the Kremlin-funded TV channel. “The effect was very powerful.”I think it's disingenuous to say they didn't know they were being doped though.. like you said, you obviously notice the effects even if you don't know what it is exactly. At some point it becomes willful ignorance.>And why would someone slip another person steroids...As to this I mean why have a nationwide doping program? National pride I guess, the fact that it was state sanctioned I'm sure the coaches were given what to give the athletes if not the docs themselves.
1 I remember reading that it was their food in the training centre getting drugged with some slight performance enhancing drugs. Nothing major for athletes to notice but enough to get caught in drug tests. If this information has changed I'm not aware of it. 
26 I think he meant the IOC bribes to get the Olympics in Sochi 
1 I do not know this specific case, but have a friend who was an alternate a couple olympics ago. He said that he took many supplements, which were legal, and had his blood drawn, given IVs occasionally with vitamins, etc. It honestly wouldn't be that hard to add a steroid, or other cocktail that wasn't allowed. The famed increase in strength, endurance, muscle mass, etc. could easily be dismissed as olympians during the run up to the Olympics often increase their workout schedule and get coached a lot more closely, and that is just in the USA.What most people don't realize is "steroids" actually covers a ton of drug types, not just steroids. Not knowing what exactly was given to the athletes, it could have been something that just increased blood flow or allowed for better oxygen circulation; both of which may be illegal according the IOC. 
3 So they still don't get to represent their country, they have to go neutral. 
2 25 sportsmen with 100% clean tests have been already banned.Also, these sportsmen had never before any positive tests.The IOC  report even say: we have no proofes of state doping programma.
11 The China is best China.
5 China takes Olympic seriously because their athletes also cheat, I would say they are number 2 cheaters after Russia, for example faking the age of their gymnasts.
-4 I doubt it.  China gets away with everything.
14 [Citation required]
12 I think the point is that Russia was doping *during* the Olympics. I know in weightlifting the athletes cycle off their gear and are technically clean at the time of competition. It's one of the reasons you never see them pull as much during competition compared to while they're training. Still though, it sounds like people seem to think that Russia was the only country doping their athletes which is hilariously naive. Pretty much everybody at the elite level is on some sort of PED. 
4 Fencers? Those 12 year old gymnasts? Curlers?
0 This is not true.
18 To my knowledge, we have never utilized the state to do so.  Russia enlisted its intelligence services to help beat anti doping measures.
25 No, US doesn't have a state sponsored doping program.
9 That's the whole point. STATE SPONSORED.
29 Do you have evidence of US state-sponsored doping?
13 US athletes have definitely doped to gain an advantage but I haven't heard of any evidence indicating our Olympic delegation plotted to cheat systematically (nor have I of China). That's the difference.
4 There are clearly US Olympians who dope and use gear, as clearly evidenced by the ones who have been caught but it is not state sponsored, or even corporate sponsored. It may go as high as certain coaches or training groups covertly encouraging all of their athletes to engage in cheating, but in general US Olympic athletes are underfunded to the point of having to work full time jobs in addition to training full time. They can rarely afford on their own the kind of designer gear that would get past Olympic screening processes. 
9 I definitely believe that the US team has systemic doping, but the thing is that there isn't proof for that. Individual athletes have been caught, but there's been nothing like the evidence that was revealed about what Russia was doing at Sochi.
1 Yeah no kidding - Russia’s crime here is that they got caught. The IOC wants exciting, world record breaking, performances and that doesn’t happen every four years naturally. 
2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_ChinaState sanctioned doping program on athletes in the 1980s and 1990s. Which is exactly what was going on in Russia.If you can find me proof the US also had state sanctioned ones, I'd be inclined to agree with you.
3 No, the USA don't use their intelligence agencies to help their athletes cheat.
1 The Us is differnet in the sense we have kept many of our teams seperate from the country as a whole with different sponsers and benefactors and leaders than the state team they make up with some athletes being almost completely independent outside of haing the "USA" written on their chest.  Teams have been busted or been investigated like the US men's distance team that was sponsered by Nike.  But our olympic programs are so decentralized that it's impossible for literally our whole olympic program to be tainted.  Russia (and i guess china?) have state teams that monitor all their programs.  This steroid scandel extends to numerous teams who all  utilized the same program.
1 Okay, lets rephrase it.  Russia is terrible, their doping program was so incompetent that they got caught.
1 Absolutely but I always felt like China and Russia were particularly brazen about it.
2 You think this will be on T_D? You sweet, summer child.
0 cyka blyat 
22 Actually being punished compared to the weakness shown by allowing Russia to compete in Rio.
7 Ya, exactly. If Russia was allowed to participate even with all these obvious scandals, Putin would have probably made a jab at the world about how Russia can get away with anything. Of course he would have said it in a very subtle manner so that everyone in on it can laugh about it and everyone else is naïve.
1 Millions of people take him seriously
8 No offense, but it's kind of our business when your corruption leaks out of your border and leads to election meddling and assassinations (among other things) on foreign soil.
5 I think it impacts the whole world so it kind of becomes everyone's business. This extends to all major powers of the world. For example, your country's internal policies and affairs almost placed a country's worth of doped athletes in the Olympics. At that point, countries have to decide how to react to it, if they ignore it or extend an "olive branch". Certainly all the fuckups USA does is open to commentary from anyone and no one shys from speaking up about it.
2 I don't think I was advocating meddling... I did not intend to.  I think it is perfectly acceptable though to be concerned about the internal health of a country as big and powerful as yours because it ends up affecting everyone.  Just like everyone in the world should be concerned as hell about my country's, the United States, internal problems (we have our own Oligarchs, even if we don't usually call them that) at the moment.  Anyway cheers
25 Wow my keyboard didn't come with one of those. 
13 No you didn't
8 Have you not been paying ANY attention the past year?
63 They're mostly Russians
6 > The fug does T_D have to do with this?I have access to one, or more, of their private discords and this topic is of some concern to them.  
1 That's Russia's subreddit.
3 Wrong country.
2 The difference between Russia and everyone else is that Russia's own government was sponsoring it. That's what makes it so much more damning then just say, Lance Armstrong doing blood doping.
-12 Doping is pretty much meaningless for the figure skating... 
1 Yeah, and skaters  from other countries totally don't!
0 They all do, they just got caught with a big scheme.
-6 You are saying that the Russian figure skating ladies cheat? Proof?Check Americans: Williams sisters in tennis, Simone Biles in gymnastics, etc etc.They all take forbidden drugs just because they got exceptions. There is a proof for that. US = double standards.
7 Unless Russia bans them from going.
1 Wait, what? did they change to rules to prohibit pro players again?
1 I would put Czech Republic and Slovakia before Switzerland.
3 The question now is who has the most almost-NHL-quality players.  I still wouldn't bet against Canada.
3 Canada still has a ton of semi-pro players because the sport is so popular in Canada. However, now it's a much more even field and it can get interesting with Sweden, USA, and Finland also being contenders
1 You underestimate KHL superstar Linden Vey
1 Sweden missing out on about a hundred NHL players will leave them pretty hampered as well.
-3 Our junior team can beat 90 percent of the men's field.
4 So business as usual then.
25 TRALALALA BAD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES LETS BAN OLYMPICS 
3 Where's the proof?
12 Yaa but the American government is not running a comprehensive doping program.Edit: a word.
1 We're good enough not to get caught.  KGB have lost their touch.  
1 We have ethics. The Russians have no scruples.
1 Please explain to me why you think its okay for a country to circumvent anti-doping regulations to gain an unfair advantage in the olympics. You can hypothesize about other countries doing it all you want, but until you actually provide evidence you come across as a blind Russia apologist. You think people ought to be allowed to cheat in sports or something?
1 I come from Latvia. I know how crooked and horrible the Russians are first hand.
1 Sure I’m down with that 
1 Because they have this weird boner for Putin.  Any right wing authority really.  
1 They're hugely pro-Russia for some reason. It's almost like nationalist pride.
1 That is not being fair... the group Russia is in pretty much makes 100% they pass through because the two bottom teams haven't even been in World Cup for ages and the second in place is the weakest they could get... 
7 Every country has cheaters, but few have a state-sponsored doping system in place. That's the difference. 
-7 I actually dope all of Bolivia and Iceland's athletes just out of my garage, I just haven't had a whistle blower snitch on me yet. Remember folks, take 5 seconds of your time to actually post a netflix link as a response instead of contrary evidence.
10 If you dig into this story, you will find the state sponsored doping has been linked to their soccer program as well. 
2 Didn't you get the memo that all corruption in the world is caused by FIFA?
1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism> attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with *Soviet and Russian propaganda.*Go collect your paycheck, Ivan. 
6 Putin most definitely cares..he's been fighting this shit with utter denial for a long time.
11 I know it's a silly old movie, but *Cool Runnings* absolutely made the push-off seem like 90% of the battle.
15 That makes sense, thanks!
1 Well for a sled event PEDs used are more likely to affect the sprint start.
-16 The US female gymnast takes ADHD drugs. This is blatant double standards, if what you're saying is correct. 
1 Who do you think pays for Doping for the 4th American sprinter running in the 4x100 m race? Do you think he can afford that all by himself? You think he can easily gain access to doping that can bypass WADA's tests? 
1 That doesn't sound right...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics https://i.imgur.com/tZoVWVV.jpg 
2 Oh gotcha. So it's the fact that is was state-sponsored and not on an individual basis.EDIT: that's one hell of a username you got there.
1 all of russia is doing those drugs?
1 Na, that was definitely a satisfying answer, thanks!      I was just curious if FIFA would care about this situation because they already have an image of being scandalous. 
1 ok enlighten me
1 Okay, I’ve heard the term doping before and I’ve never knew exactly what it was. Honestly I thought it would be worse. Steroid use isn’t the end of the world. 
2 I'm not sure if that's the true answer to his/her question, but it does make sense in a certain light.
2 I'm sorry, once again your answer must be phrased in the form of "fake news" outrage.  We have to go to the other contestants now...
1 >What makes you doubt the truthfullness of the story? You think Russia didn't engage in systematic doping?lol, i said "it may be true" i didnt say "i doubt its true"... not sure why i have to explain this.>CNN? It's the New York Times....Grab that Websters and scroll to "Comparision".  Boom, makes sense now.>"...the proud sports juggernaut that has long used the Olympics as a show of global force..."That's the actual quote... What's wrong with that sentence? I mean, come on....when you presume that another Entity is doing something, that is called an Opinion.  Meaning, the writer has no proof from Russian documents that say "In Soviet Georgia we shall use the Olympics to demonstrate our GLOBAL FORCE, AK-47... Mother Russia..."I mean, did i miss something here... or is an opinion now taken on the context of fact just because someone from New York writes it in their Diary?
1 You're so right. Hate is too easy sometimes.
1 Well if he knew who it is then we would no wouldn't we?
1 I don't think he's arguing that Russia is doping. He's arguing that Russia is the only one that's caught.Fairly certain other ones dope too just haven't been caught yet.
-57 Not sure what that has to do with doping. But nice bait-n-switch.
1 Are you being sarcastic? The relevance of Russia being banned is because the doping programs were **state**-sponsored. Unlike a certain coach or athlete choosing to PEDs themselves.
1 There's a difference between individual athletes doping and a coordinated state sponsored doping program.
1 Everything you just said you could accuse the United states of as well.
1 "Decades of wars, murders, repurcussionx, occupation," sounds like you just described the US
1 If only there was some dope german word to describe how good it felt for us, russians :)
1 Doping is doping no matter what. The minute you try and change the argument to suit your own process, you have lost. Every fucker dopes. You remember a couple of years back when the was breaking the amount of athletes coming forward saying it's absolutely normal and they were getting offered it from their coaches etc? This is rife. 
1 You're asking a random person on the internet to somehow come up with proof that countries aid their athletes with doping? You understand that it would be very well covered up and kept hush hush yeah? This investigation took YEARS. Take your head out of the sand sweetheart. 
-21 That's funny you think they are the only ones guilty.
23 Dude your whole comment history is calling people retards and defending Russia in every thread. 
1 Name another country who participated in a state sponsored doping program?
1 Their program was state sponsored, not done by the choice of individual athletes or coaches dummy.
12 Show me another country with a state-wide doping program where intelligence officers help swap out dirty urine for clean urine when the sun goes down.
-10 Do u think America did nothing similar? Lock back in time how many experiments done in history in the united States. It's really naive to think America is a white sheep. (Sorry English is not my main language)
-7 Hockey is the biggest part of Winter Olympics by far. Besides figure skating, who cares about the rest? All the best players are in the NHL and the KHL. So we'll be seeing mediocre hockey teams consisting of players from the weakest leagues.
-14 I don't think it's bad behavior. Nobody wants to go back to 11 second 100m dash. They're all doped to the gills and what's more, nothing will stop this. It's like prohibition or the war on drugs. Regulate the use and make sure the athletes use responsibly instead of shaming them for doing what the crowds want.
-1 They were initially banned from competing in the summer Olympics in Rio, but that decision was reversed for economic reasons.  That was bullshit.  Now, however, the incident is in the past.  The effort to punish it had failed.  Now what?  You go back and try again?  4 years later?  I don't like it.
1 Yes. I understand. It's individual (or team) corruption vs country. It is still ignorant to think widespread doping across all sports is not an issue
1 yeah but for me the olympics are a joke now, remember the heroes we used to adore? doped... then they can magically come back.  even if it's not a state system, dope is a "sport" system now...it's impossible not to be suspicious anymore (except for BOLT)  like in the "tour de france" all these guys full of drugs climbing mountains faster than a car!;) they even got electric bikes...man doping is so much everywhere that sport is dead...  so yeah, Russia was caught, like you know everything is suddenly super clean, my ass!   
23 No, they weren't banned because of doping, they were banned because of *state backed doping*. Doping on an individual basis doesn't lead to an entire country getting banned, but when that state is supporting the doping, then it does. 
15 The US doesn't engage in state sponsored doping and subsequent coverups by intelligence agencies. Big, *big* difference there between independent athletes doing it and what Russia is doing. 
6 Buddy, nobody hates the US more than the US does.
2 Well for my predictions to come true there are going to have to be a lot of neck injuries for the Australians.
1 Hmm yes the only possible response is World War III. Idiot.
2 You named it??
-2 >Regardless of how you wish it could be, Russia broke the rules of the system and are banned for it accordingly.There's nothing wrong with breaking rules when the rules you're breaking are dumb. In many states, weed is still illegal, do you think everyone who smokes weed in those states is wrong?>If the global community wanted to create a steroid olympics as a separate entity then that is its own issue,Sure, but they don't.>though the ethics of it are extremely questionable.No, they're not, as long as everyone who participates chooses to and knows the risks.
-1 Same with Germany. Same with the USA (balco labs)
1 Ha. You’re going to look pretty stupid when all of your weed buddies get a job because the economy is booming and you’re still glued to the couch. Take another hit, bongo boy.
1 Because if something was relevant in the past, it obviously cant be relevant now. 
1 Just look at what the event as a whole has done to some of these cities. They build these huge structures for years then use them for a month. Once they leave the structures are abandoned and rendered useless because of the size of most of them. It’s a ploy. Oh it will bring your country pride and money. When really money is lost and who gives a shit who can go down a mountain the fastest?
4 Not true for curling, either. If you watch curling, you'd notice that teams have gotten a lot more fit over the last 15 or so years, as they've found that being in good shape for sweeping gives you a lot more control over the rocks trajectory.https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/wuIeSZwh8_TeUqbTHoRyyw/http/pbs.twimg.com/media/BgAkjljCMAAZFIx.jpg

1578 Perhaps we will go back to the good ole days. Craft the best possible team through mostly kids tryna make it big!
149 >They tried to get some degree of compensation out of the IOC in exchange for their continued participation and didn't succeed in that, which led to the NHL pulling out.Ah, there it is. So it's actually about money. EDIT: Guys I didn't say that there was anything wrong with it being about money. Just pointing it out. Please stop explaining things to me like you're my financial advisers. Thanks. 
40 The NHL is also hoping the World Cup of Hockey will fill the Olympics role for professional players.But these tournaments are useless because Canada is just going to win no matter what level players are going
5 The biggest problem is that the IOC refuses to insure players if I remember right, isn't it?
3 Wait, NHL decides this on an Olympic by Olympic bases?
2 They should claim to be a summer sport now like basketball and play in the summer olympics.
2 If I remember correctly, the only NHL team that was going to allow players to compete in the Olympics was the Capitals.
2 Nah the real reason is because canada once again will get gold in mens nhl hockey team as usual. 
2 > exposes their players to potentially serious injuriesAs someone who doesn't watch hockey, could you please explain this?As in, how are they exposed to more injuries playing a game in the Olympics vs a regular game?
2 The NHL players that do play in the Olympics love it - but they do in fact come home very tired from the trip.  It's hard to finish a gold medal game in one part of the world on a Sunday and be ready for Monday night's NHL resumption playing for their NHL team.  Detroit Red Wings one season had a tonne of players on various countries and it hurt them for weeks afterwards. That being said - I love the NHL players there. 
2 The biggest reason is insurance, the IOC was formerly willing to pay to insure NHL players against injuries that would be costly to their teams. One corrupt organization is refusing to pay the exorbitant cost demanded by another corrupt organization, nothing more.
1 If you wanted to spin this in a good way, instead of a bunch of NHL allstars making up teams, this makes room for a lot of players out of college or in minor leagues to prove them self.
1 TIL Thx!  :)
1 I saw a great interview with Brian Burke, who was involved with the negotiations to bring nhl players to the Olympics. He said that EVERYONE wants nhl players to go... but south Korea was unwilling to pay for the transit, accomodation...and insurance for all the players.... which is a HUGE cost apparently. The nhl didn't want to foot such a large bill to risk their talent getting hurt at the Olympics... and they never settled on a solution
3 Important to note that previously the IOC had given compensation and now is not going to. Understandable position given they don't compensate anyone else for participating. 
2 Let's keep in mind that they're all bullshit excuses. They don't lose any games. And they put their players at risk all the time in marketing ventures. (Why is there the world cup of hockey and all Star games)The real reason is because the NHL doesn't see the compensation they think they are entitled too.
1 *their
1 It'll be good to let amateur athletes play instead of NHL stars, the whole thing is supposed to be for non-professional sports.Even though, the finals match between USA and Canada in the ~~2014~~ 2010 Olympics was by far the best game of hockey I've ever watched. And as a Penguins fan, pretty damn exciting.
1 I guess there is no agency that oversees all of hockey the way FIFA oversees all of soccer and the way ITF oversees tennis?  I thought most big sports had international agencies like these, but for some reason hockey doesn't?  Or is it the other way around and soccer, tennis, etc. are unique in that they do?
1 Look at the bright side, the most memorable US Olympic team (the miracle team) weren't NHL players. 
1 The IOC stated that the NHL would not be allowed to attend the China games if they did not attend Korea. No idea if that was an idle threat or not, but I was surprised the NHL stuck to their guns since it's very obvious how bad they want to grow the game in China. 
1 Gonna be one of the least exciting olympics w/o hockey.... 
1 Seriously hate that. Corporate greed trumps a Nations pride, it's a damn shame.
1 those are good reasons 
1 So, corporate power over the olympic spirit? 
1 Also: Bettman just needs to fuck up everything.
1 Should do it like soccer. In soccer it’s basically a U-23 team with the option of three players that are older than that. 
1 The obvious solution to me is to make hockey a Summer Olympics event. Might seem weird, but basketball is played at the same exact time as hockey, and basketball is a Summer Olympic event.
1 TL;DR - greed and money now outweigh national pride.
1 NHL will only go back when Bettman isn't in charge anymore. 
1 Hey money money money.
1 Like pulled out as in forbidding the NHL players playing on national teams? Or just pulling funding?
1 Great awnser, well explained
1 You have to return the Stanley cup. You get to keep a gold medal. I'd much rather win the Olympics.
1 "It disrupts their regular season schedule." What? What about every Olympic game they've been in since 1998, so why now? Besides it doesn't disrupt the regular season when maybe 2 players per team will have to take a couple weeks leave.
1 If the NHL players don't realise the honour of competing for a medal fuck em. 
1 Was it the NHL wanting compensation, or the players? 
1 IOC told them if they didn’t come to South Korea they weren’t welcome in China.Between the last lockout and this... I could care less about the nhl. 
1 You're missing alot of details here. The IoC wouldn;t let the NHL use any clips or claim sponsorship for allowing use of their players in the NHL. The IoC also would not cover the Millions in insurance for the players(injury insurance).The IIHF offered to pay for the insurance for the NHL players, but the NHL declined stating that money is to be used to grow the game(the Olympics does this). The NHL takes all the risk and gets no almost no benefits to sending their players during the NHL season to the Olympics.It's a dual fault situation, but i'd lay the blame at 70% IoC, 30% NHL.
1 There is some players with contracts that states that they can't be stopped from playing for their home nation though. Seems to be a Sweden vs Finland this time around though. 
1 And it's really too bad because olympic hockey is the marquee event in Winter Olympics. Hockey us to the winters what the 100m is to the summers.
1 Yeah the injuries thing is a legit reason. Imagine how the fans at home would feel if that happened to their team.
1 It's more than that. Back when the story broke, the NHL people basically said that the Olympics were found to not influence revenue generation and that by allowing players to go, they were risking a possible injury and gaining nothing for the teams (income wise). It was a load of shit, and a lot of players were upset by it.
1 Call me old fashioned, but all pro Dream Team's are lame. 
0 That's the bullshit the NHL feeds the public to justify their decision of pulling out. The main reason the NHL doesn't want their players there is that it waters down the ratings of their own mediocre product, The Olympics is essentially a giant All-Star game where players actually try to win. Every year, the NHL promotes their All-Star weekend, showcasing their players in a boring high scoring game where they don't try at all. It lacks any sort of excitement at all, especially when compared to the Olympics, which are often played with playoff intensity. In the end, the NHL loses money by allowing their players to go to Olympics. They're a greedy corporation trying to maximize profits, and that is  what this decision boils down to.
0 this isn't the "biggest reason" at all. The biggest reason why the NHL has pulled out of the olympics is because the IOC and IIHF refuse to share profits with the NHL during the 2 weeks the Olympics are on and the IOC and IIHF also refused to cover liability for player compensation if they get injured.An example of what happened is one year  Jonathan Tavares who plays for the Islanders got injured at the olympics and then was out the entire rest of the NHL year. At the time, he was touted as a superstar player for the Islanders, so you can see how this begins to effect them as a business.What it all comes down to is greed. The NHL owners don't want to share their contracted players, even when it's someone like Sidney Crosby or Patrick Kane who wins their owners and city 3 stanley cups and probably sells an insurmountable amount of merchandise for them. It's a bullshit move and now Gary Bettman and the NHL are also invested in their new "world cup of hockey" which means they'll be pushing even harder now to make sure the NHL never goes back to the olympics. Which sadly isn't fair to any european players who grew up dreaming about olympic gold. People also aren't realizing that a "juniors only" olympic tournament nowadays is redundant: Juniors compete every year now in an international tournament during the winter called "The World Juniors." How does Olympic competition in ice hockey now even matter when that's held every year? The era of amateur competition in the olympics has been over now for decades. Many european countries now have amateur organizations or associations which practically border on professional anyway. It's one reason why for example a boxer like Vasil Lomachenko from the Ukraine has such an incredible amateur boxing record, while american amateurs struggle to have even half of what he accomplished. The olympics also allow professional basketball players to go every four years now and the NBA hasn't bothered batting an eye about it for years. What it comes down to here is the NHL's greed. That's all.
-1 What serious injuries are they exposed to that they aren't in the regular league?EDIT: Little confused on the down votes... I don't follow sports and was curious. 
0 Its so greedy by the NHL.  There is a financial component to it (flights, housing, insurance, etc), but Asia is one of the markets they really want to bring hockey to.  They had pre-season games over there this season, (which weren't all that well attended) and they are missing out on a ton of advertising by not allowing players to play for the Olympics.
-4 Wow. I wish I knew vaginas like you know hockey.
-2 I bet it has to do with the drug testing this time around is going to be under extra scrutiny. 
65 Your talking about the World Cup of Hockey and it blows. No one wants to watch it. 
3 I agree. I think this is exactly what’s occurring. It’s sad really, only the fans miss out. 
2 Like demolishing a national park to boost the sale of natural landscape VR.
-5 lol wut? Nope..... The NHL is not: > attempting to make their own international hockey torunamentThe WCOH was an experiment, it is not expected to happen again. Even if it were, it would likely be occuring every four years, and the NHL wouldnt be daft or illogical enough to schedule the WCOH during the Olympics, so they obviously would/do not see > Olympic winter games as a threat to their new revenue source. I hope your pulling this out of someone elses ass as well as your own, otherwise thats a whole lot of shit.Edit: 4
143 A young all-star is literally worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a team. Someone like Stamkos, Ovechkin, etc is easily going to bring a team that much return - or more - in team performance, playoff gate revenue, merchandising, etc.The Olympics is asking the NHL to:- (a) stop their season for 3 weeks,- (b) send **all** of their all-stars halfway across the planet,- (c) to pay for all the *insurance* themselves, - (d) risk short-term, long-term or career-ending injury to each and every player,**and**- (e) the NHL can't commercialize or profit off *anything*.If you owned assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, something tells me you wouldn't ship those assets across the planet, for *somebody else* to make a shitload of money off of, none of which you will ever see.
3 The IOC isn't exactly the white knight in that story either. 
3 This is really what it comes down to, the teams have always been aware of the injury risk and have been willing to accept that. It's the lack of advertising rights that pissed the NHL off enough to go start their own tournament (World Cup of Hockey?)
1 Don't the players have a say in all of this?
1 The real reason is actually that the IOC is refusing to pay injury insurance to the NHL anymore.A player like Crosby probably has an injury insurance claim in the millions of dollars if he gets hurt at the Olympics and is unable to play for the Penguins. Its likely that on other athlete at the winter olympics has a claim that large because the olympics is their main competition, and yet hockey has 30-40 of those players. The IOC was done taking on the risk of paying out multiple claims, considering how poorly the winter olympics do revenue wise and told the NHL they need to pay for it or they wont allow their players to compete. The NHL has always said they wont pay it (even though in my opinion they should) and took a gamble on the World Cup of Hockey in the hopes that people wouldn't be as bothered by no hockey at the olympics, and they can have more control over the competition.
101 Because the IOC is greedier and doesn't want to pay. The IOC refused to pay for insurances for the NHL players attending, which from the point of view of NHL owners means they'd just be allowing their assets to go and risk hurting themselves and their businesses, so the owners collectively said nope to all that. Hockey is a business first and foremost.
19 You're confusing greed for frugality. Not wanting to lose money is frugal, wanting more money is greed. Not saying the NHL isn't greedy. But not wanting to millions of dollars is not greedy.
34 And the IOC... isn't greedy? o.OLMFAO
13 I don't want to lose money, am I greedy? 
3 It's not a fucking charity, it's a business. There's nothing wrong with a business wanting more money.
8 businesses not wanting to lose money lmao idiots
2 Sending your leagues players to the Olympics is a great way to grow the game and get national publicity. The NHL doesn't want their players to be injured for the season, so they deny players the chance to play for their country. A lot of players have been playing their whole life with the goal to make it to the Olympics. The NHL shouldn't just be able toss that aside 
1 Trying to make a living isn’t greedy...
0 The NHL never loses money because of the Olympics. It is just bad for the players.
-1 NHL get paid the worst out of any national level athletes. There are NHL folks earning like $50k a year. They have a reason to be salty E: was incorrect, the $50k is AHL (feeds to NHL) minimum salary. E2: IM SORRY I WAS WRONG :(
1 NBA players go to the Olympic Games, don't they?
1 I don't think so, it's supposed to be about the best sporters, right?
52 I had wet dreams of this lineupStamkos- Crosby - McDavidDoughty - Burns
9 What will Canada do now? How do they recruit for a hockey team?
2 Parise against Crosby was awesome. 
1 > McDavid and Crosby against Kane and MatthewsWatching those two games would have been amazing.  As Crosby and McDavid won gold against Finland, and Kane and Matthews competed for bronze against Russia.
1 You still can. The NHL will still be organising the World Cup of Hockey.
131 Short answer: $$$$Longer answer: It requires the NHL to adjust their in season schedule and open up teams to the liability of their player being injured when not playing for the team. In return the NHL got nothing back from the IOC. The crux was using Olympic highlights and pictures for NHL advertisements I believe. IOC played hardball, so the NHL backed out.  
79 Owners don't want their star players potentially injured playing hockey for their country. 
91 Middle of the season.  $$$$$$$
3 Wear and tear on the players, no NHL team wants their players to wear themselves out or get hurt in a tournament that doesn't lead to the Cup.
1 The players get even more tired and hurt in the middle of the NHL season. I don't agree with it (and neither do most of the players) but I understand it.
1 GOOD point by my wife, if they pull out there's less chance of the Olympics to get pregnat
1 IIRC, the NHL used to take a break in the middle of the season to let players go play for their respective countries. This shortened the season, meaning less money. But probably a bigger reason, these teams are under contract to play for them for millions. They don't want to risk sending their assets off to play games that don't benefit their teams, and risk season ending or career ending injuries. 
1 I think some teams have on an individual basis allowed players to go since then. Maybe you're right, but I doubt the NHL will make that the overall policy again. 
178 I mean everyone else trains non stop for 4 years with sponsorships for it. It hasn’t been an amateur event in my lifetime 
9 It literally isn’t an amateur event.
8 ...no it’s not
1 I don't think so. We used college basketball players for years and it great.
1 Yeah but now we're used to the pros playing...
1 Kind of like boxing. No one was chanting at Floyd to fight. It's more for up-and-comers. 
1 It's not an amateur event. It's supposed to be the highest tier of competition there is.
1 1980 didn't have NHLers, worst Olympic hockey ever
1 Russia always had pros.
1 And it's been waaay more popular since the pros joined.
23 Not true in terms of the roster that Canada has preliminarily out together. A mix of ex-NHLers and players playing in Europe. Not many junior/College players at all. 
4 The vast majority of nhlers are extremely competitive and give it their all each and every shift. This narrative that nhlers don’t try is completely false. 
5 The kids from college and the CHL already have their "Olympics" and it starts on Boxing Day.Canada will send a Spengler Cup type team at best.
1 [Until you remember the ENTIRE U18 Russian team dropped out of world’s because of doping as well](http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/doping-scandal-sees-entire-russian-u18-team-replaced-at-world-championships)
1 Yeah I think it’s gonna be exciting as fuck. Everyone going is going to think they have a chance. People who had no business 4 years ago will be playing with their flag on their jersey. It’s gonna be great hockey
46 I think he/she means you need players from the two best leagues in the world.  But hockey's awesome at all levels, I still think it could be fun.
72 But good players help
4 Well, not *that* kind of dope.
0 *Whoosh*
0 pretty sure doping makes most things exciting.... which is why people do it
-2 You need way more than doping to make it exciting, you’re right 
-4 You do kind of need the best players in the world, though. 
1 All of Sweden and most of the good teams are made of almost entirely NHL/KHL players. 
14 Every four years I get super excited about Curling
6 I never realized how many good looking woman curlers there were until the Olympics.  It is like a sexy soccer mom fest.
2 I prefer cat curling.
1 Hello fellow Canadian.
29 Do the words "Cool Runnings" mean  nothing to you? 
32 If both the NHL and KHL are out then why would Sweden or Finland be any more of a favorite than Canada or any of the usual favorites?All the best players from Finland and Sweden play in the NHL or KHL as well.
2 People keep saying that but they also keep forgetting that many of the top performers in the KHL and other leagues are Canadian
4 "the best competing" is like the entire point of the olympics is it not?Sure I can go watch some 3rd rate players compete at something, but the reason to watch the olympics is to see "the best" competing against each other no? 
2 More fun than 2010 Crosby scoring an overtime goal? ha!
1 Hoping Team USA has the sense to add some NCAA players and bring some up-and-comers into the mix. Would do a lot to change the tone about the roster.
5 Except that we already know the final will be USA v Canada because there are only 2 good teams.
1 >it's going to actually be a competition for all teams this timebecause it wasn't before? I don't really understand what you mean by that.
3 I find women's hockey just doesn't have enough good teams.Like what are the odds on a USA v Canada final? 99%?
1 They are technically if they don't have an NHL contract but won't be going. The best Junior players are not a match for even an AHLer. The only way I could see that is if there was a generational talent like Connor McDavid who is 2018 draft eligible right now (which there isn't)
6 Eh, I'd still place my bets on Canada to win again.But then again, I'm Canadian :)
10 you might be right. I was just talking shit. 
2 The WHL And even Junior A talent is pretty spot on, so even with the NHL and anyone with NHL contracts out, I’m not worried. 
2 I'd argue it hurts the USA more since they don't have the same depth spread out across the world.
1 Czech Republic FTW!!!!
1 Canada and the US have strong representation in those same leagues. I don't think there's a real heavy favourite anymore. It will basically come down to the team with the hottest goalie.
1 I mean, is that really out of character for Putin?
1 Ahh ok, so they flat out banned their players from participating. Thanks. Is this decision popular with the players? I can imagine some would enjoy playing on the international stage outside the World Cup.  
1352 I'd watch dat.
6 Future me: *I remember the Olympics before steroids were mandatory.* 
10 And vodka, cause you know, nothing goes with steroids like good ol' vodka 
3 Let's be honest, if you really think about it, it's kinda arbitrary where we draw the line. We use all sorts of techniques to improve performance. Better gear, better diet, cupping therapy and so on. Food is chemicals too. Why not just allow it all and see where that takes us.
2 Dont forget the vodka!
2 This could actually be it's own thing, lol The "Superhuman Games" or something.
2 I'd watch this. Let's see how far we can push the human body. Everything is legal. All drugs, any manner of body alterations... I wanna see who would win: a wrestler on steroids or a wrestler on PCP.

1 Me too. I want to see the pinnacle of human performance.
1 Lets not forget the vodka 
1 Sounds a lot more entertaining than the normal Olympics.
1 Good. Fuck the current Olympics and professional sports idea of a "clean" game. Its currently a "I didn't get caught" game. Let them all use steroids and whatever performance enhancing drugs they want and let them go at it. I want to see the athletes drug regiment along side their states.All the current method does is make them hide it better, an arms race of drugs vs drug testing nothing more. Everyone at the top of their game is doping in some way or another.This way they can unban use of Anabolic steroids since they're ONLY banned for use by the general public because of sports, nothing more. There are plenty of very useful applications for them (and no bullshit side effects people keep saying like your dick shrivels up or roid rage. Neither is true.)
1 Oh fuck, that could actually work. Questionable ethics aside, people would definitely watch an Olympics where everyone is roided up to the max. Over the years, they've developed all sorts of doping techniques besides steroids to evade detection. I wonder what superhuman feats could be achieved if you combined all of them. 
1 Trump will forego the Olympics to attend the Kremlimpics.
1 Loser gets to rejoin Russian Federation. “What if Russia loses?”“...we have to rejoin Russian Federation”“...”
1 Kazakhstan isn’t all that friendly, to be honest. Russian conquest of Crimea freaked them out, they have a fairly sizeable Russian minority in the north-east of Kazakhstan, and some Russian officials in 2014 went as far as to claim that that territory should rightfully belong to Russia. 
1 Looking at endless advertising of Azerbaijan cycling and now Kazakhstan on Eurosport - they'll find the money.
41 The American woman won the friendship games? But she has an asterisk cuz it wasn't the Olympics? Or cuz the friendship games were more competitive and she has an asterisks cuz she won in the Olympics but the real competition would have been the friendship games? I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble understanding your post, but this is super interesting.Edit: specifically having trouble with which one was still a big event for gymnastics, I think once I can figure that out, I'll understand the post.
24 What reason?     Edit: OP was talking about the US being unchallenged at the Olympics. Gotcha. Talking about Mary Lou Retton.

7 Can we get some more details about what you mean? 
3 Took the words right out of my mouth, thank you.
1 As someone who doesn't follow international sports much at all, what do you mean by >we say that she has an asterisks next to her gold medal for a reason.
1 Poor Krusty lost a lot of money on those games. 
1 This is confusing because it reads like you're saying an American woman won the all-round medal at the Friendship Games, but you actually mean she won the Olympics. Americans didn't get any medals at the friendship games.
1 Well yeah, because the whole eastern bloc was juiced to the gills, of course they were doing stuff no clean athlete was capable of.

1 Sweet severance payment 
72 Easily. Reading Russian press now, I don't see much a lot of hysteria or any mention of complying with M.O.C. Yes, Russia will try to legally protest, but that probably would be extent of it. I wouldn't be surprised if Russia said "Fuck Olympics, we are done with it"
1 Just a side note, 2020 is also going to be held by their neighboring country...
1 they will probably invade and call it "Just some russian athletes on holiday"
1 "Win" the "election" against the "opposition". ; - ) 
1 Putin will show up to the Olympics registered as the only athlete from Russia for every event.Then he will show up to the events and just stand at the start holding up his middle finger.Shirtless.
15 I was an observer on several elections. Also I happen to read some papers on statistical irregularities in Russian elections data, and while parliamentary elections showed a lot of such irregularities ( which caused protests in 2011), presidential elections showed almost none.Also polls also show that Putin is popular among Russian population.You can argue that game rigged before election by using administrative resource and removing all of real opposition from being able to run, but that is a different question. As for elections Putin won last elections, and will win next elections.
1 Putin is actually insanely popular with Russians. Whether you believe it or not. He has an 88% approval rating. 
-2 Putin is fairly popular with a good number of Russians partly because they are all taught Russian history. that changes their perspective on politics because how the day to day life of a Russian lives is more of a big deal to them than who plays big diplomat boy, and under Putin they have had more personal freedom than other Russian people before them, and that is good.  i am not a Russian man, but I am able to understand the Russian man and why most of them I have spoken to have said that he's no worse than any US President so who gives a shit?
-6 Well, actually because this one is his last, he is going to make them fair as much as possible. He would've actually won with the same competitors with the fair system, because competitors are shit right now and Navalny by far one of the biggest clowns. I would say that if Navalny tryed to become a president of any European country he wouldn't go past % required to get on ballots, but in Russia - Leader of Opposition, easy.
1 Well he'd win whether it was an election or an "election."  They actually like him.  I mean Trump won in the USA.  Yes he lost the popular vote but that's not how presidents are elected.
1 No for me it is not bad thing. Garfunkel and Oates nailed ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fraSdN-PG8
2 No. It's not. For people in power in Russia Olympics is a PR thing. If it doesn't provide PR benefits why bother. Probably people weren't sure that Russia can achieve good results in Sochi without doping. So again if there is no PR or "national pride" then why bother. Olympic spirit ? HA HA HAAgain in Russia big sport is mostly government sponsored. That is part of the issue. People pay big money and expect big results. If it were private enterprises there wasn't much pressure to achieve results, and much less drama.
1 In Russia Olympics is often government sponsored. Sportsmen who disobey may have trouble getting money afterwards
1 It's not allowed. Even if they do them they would need to cover them.
1 Yep. Russia was so corrupt that Putin is actually an improvement. That's why he is liked so much. Before him things were worse. Much much worse.
19 I always set my money loose, it isn't right to keep it captive. Let it roam free as nature intended.
2 > millions of dollars.I'm sure the IOC is in tears right now.
63 I was also floored by the roller coaster of events, but found myself most surprised by Grigory as a person. I started out thinking he was a scumbag, but by the end of it I had a lot of respect for him.
1 Absolutely!! One minute a documentary on amateur doping, then major plot twist and now documenting on one of the biggest sporting scandals.I still can't get over the timing. 
1 Just watched too. Mind=Blown. And it also confirmed my belief that the IOC are a bunch of idiots.
1 Yeah, the descriptions of it make it sound a little boring. But it's one of the least boring documentaries I've ever seen. But it's hard to describe the exciting parts without giving away the entire crazy story.
1 I had no idea what I was in for when it started. Only decided to watch it because of the tie in to the TDF.  Excellent documentary.
1 Most documentaries are like that, quiaff?
465 Now I have 20 seconds more to spend pressing "refresh" on reddit 
11 Sad day for Putin. He cheats and lies and tries so hard to "Make Russia Great Again" after being smacked around in the cold war (I raise only because based on most biographical accounts I've read, he still harbors resentment), and now we see all this mess being peeled back and the reputation of Russia only worsening on the world stage. Guy needs a wake-up call, but he's a paranoid megalomaniac, so unlikely.But hey, yet again, Russia denies it. From denying intrusion on various nations' election systems, denying troops in Ukraine, denying their missiles blowing up a civilian airliner, denying doping—Denialism is so heavy in Russia, one wonders if Russian leadership are a bunch of scared little cowards too afraid of being upfront with their own actions. **Why is Putin such a coward that he cannot admit to the atrocities he's committed? Doesn't seem like a very strong leader at all.**
3 Incredible documentary.
3 The documentary starts out by misattributing a quote to George Orwell.  Is it worth the watch?
2 Thank you
2 Probably one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. I have no interest in cycling or doping for that matter, but I could not stop watching that show.
1 Thanks.  Have a karma.
1 Thanks for this. Does it exists outside of Netflix as well?
1 A link for the lazy? 
1 Wait… Is that a movie or a documentary? Trailers are getting weird these days…
1 Muricaaaa
1 You're the best
47 Rogan had the guy that made it on his podcast. Worth a listen imo. https://youtu.be/P2FCBIpKCdI
12 There's that factor of pure luck for the director of being in contact with the "right person" at the "right time" that made it from a standard documentary into an incredible chronicle of a unique moment in sports.
24 Thought the same thing!
6 I still don't understand why it didn't make a bigger splash, my jaw was on the floor the whole time I was watching it. Though I suppose it may be pushed back into the limelight now...
3 It really was just a incredible set of happenstance, what would have been a very interesting documentary turns into something complete different and even better. 
2 Same. I was casually watching it when my husband put it on, and by the end I was on the edge of my seat. Plus lots of cute doggos in the beginning. 
2 As a racing cyclist the first part was enthralling and then it completely goes into holy shit mode. The other factor I can't shake out of my head now is if this is the level of espionage they are using for their athletes then the political and technology aspects are likely even bigger than have been uncovered so far.
2 It's like a James Bond film, all the cloak and dagger stuff around stealing and replacing drug test samples, the special locked bottles they used, the security, really amazing stuff. 
1 Why is it rated MA? Language? I'm just curious since I'm at work and thinking of whether I should watch with kids. Thanks!
1 Follow that up with Tour De Pharmacy!
1 Yeah. If you go in like I did expecting a docu on doping in cycling, it's crazy
1 Meta documentaries like this really appeal to me. Icarus is up there on my list of faves, as is the one regarding the voyeur who bought a motel to watch people.
1 It's really awesome! Total mindfuck... 
0 *Minor Spoilers*I was disappointed in some ways with the movie. As a cyclist I was really interested in the first portion, then felt kind of let down when it seems like they totally abandoned that Haute Route plot for the Rodchenkov one. That storyline was probably more interesting and had mass appeal, but I found it disappointing to not really provide closure for the first half of the movie. On the other hand, they probably didn't have enough content to produce an entire film about Rodchenkov. If so, I'm glad they didn't try and drag anything out.Would still recommend watching it. In fact, I clicked on here to check that someone suggested it.
3 Yeah, because sports obsessed US totally turns a blind eye to doping and doping scandals and no one or team has ever gone down for it.
3 Lol, wtf  are you on?
1 I'm sure they are. After watching that documentary, I have almost no doubt in my mind. The craziest thing to me was (SPOILER ALERT) [spoiler] (/s "how much the games affected politics. I went into the film thinking, 'oh yeah neat little film about drugs in the Olympics. Interesting for sure, but it's just games, after all.' Then they showed that graph of Putin's approval rating and mentioned the invasion of the Ukraine and my mind was blown. It has far more impact than I could have imagined.")
-1  There it is.   
190 > It is pretty amazing what, IMO, Russia will go to to protect it's image.What surprises me is they think they have an image to save.
93 Everyone out to be on the look out for bots and Russian cyberinfluencers about this story. Russia goes to some crazy lengths to protect its image. 
15 Russia is like the kid on the playground who won’t shut up about how tough he is. It never occurs to him that this makes him seem pathetic and weak, as though he’s blatantly overcompensating for problems at home. 
1 It's a mobster state where the elite survives by pumping out nationalistic propaganda. That's also the reason for all these border conflicts, war fervor is perfect to distract the people. After all it's all those western, Chechen, Ukrainian saboteurs that keep Russia from greatness.
1 Like Jung-Un of North Korea having his brother murdered in an airport with VX chemical weapons b/c he wanted nothing more to do with NK regime... Top of a regime is a precarious place, can't manage all threats so need to decapitate as many as possible as an example.
2 >Russia wants to protect itself AT ALL COSTS, be it poor battle planning, sports doping, or candy crush high scores. Voting machine high scores, too.
0 >It  In the US, if something like this were to happen, I feel like some would be ashamed, some upset, others apathetic.While not the same thing we do see the same behavior based on the same principles when certain high profile Republicans candidates are exposed as sexual predators/pedophiles yet their American voters rush to defend them, excuse it and pretend it's okay. We see the leader of the country fail to condemn mass killings and acts of terrorism due to the perpetrator being a rightwing activist (or just white), we see him retreat Nazi propaganda from a group convicted of killing a UK politician. Yet the silence is speaking for itself... 
1 It's not about the lengths they will go. It's about how much Human Life matter to them. 
1 > I feel like some would be ashamed, some upset, others apathetic.I feel like that's probably the case in Russia too
1 Just a Canadian but isn't there that *extremely* obvious hit on that dude who outed the democrats or something last election?I feel like not many people cared
-2 If this happened in the US they would bribe or blackmail whoever caught them, minimise the story, point fingers elsewhere, and shunt the story into irrelevance. Russia and the US have been competitors for many years in many spheres, but in the field of propaganda Russia's crude stumblings are pathetic in the face of the polished sophistication on display in the US.
-1 Look at Snowden and Chelsea Manning and how they were treated by the USA. Both countries hate their respective whistleblowers because they exposed the corrupt goverments. 
-2 The US is better at hiding stuff and the government tools over ever 4 to 8 years so everything gets blamed on the last guy even though they never really change. 
3 Russians can still individually compete if they're clean. They register as an "Olympic athlete from Russia"
3 You don't seem like a Fuckface at all. In fact quite the opposite. I am so confused.
2 This comment is beautiful. 
1 He fled Russia before they got killed and also had shared info with the documentary maker of icarus already.
581 Just so everyone knows, despite the numerous cop shows and movies, the Witness Protection Program has never failed, ever.
5 I believe his wife and family are still in Russia though. Basing this on info I heard a couple months back.
2 I'm wondering how the WPP handles subjects that are well known by the general public 
2 >FSBActually Russian operations on foreign soil are handled by the SVR instead of the FSB. They have their own direct action unit for military operations and assassinations , called the Zaslon. The SVR is the group that has been accused of the polonium poisonings including that of Alexander Litvinenko.  The only international countries where the FSB operates instead of the SVR are the former Soviet republics a.k.a CIS countries, where due to inter-government agreements it is legal for the FSB or internal intelligence agencies to operate. Under those agreements the SVR is legally forbidden under Russian law to operate in CIS countries. For the rest of the world the SVR goes in first.
1 > Grigory is currently in the U.S. witness protection program,And look at who is President right now.....:(
1 I think his wife is in Russia though.
1 Which is amazing considering it relies at least partly on the witnesses themselves not slipping up.
1 Trump will give him up to his Russian masters
22 > If they don’t kill him, he’s never going to be able to live a normal life.If they kill him, then, it sounds like he will be able to live a normal life?
9 Damn, that really sucks that he wasn't able to get his family out of there before the story broke. 
16 Or Russia overthrows Putin and installs a government that actually represents the people.
1 > He’s currently in protective custody in the USA. "Protected" by Putin's fanboy Trump.... 
-3 He will never be able to live a normal life first and foremost because he is simply considered a traitor. Many believe that he run away not because he suddenly felt the urge to tell the truth, but because he was  a criminal about to get caught in Russia.  With a reputation like this, who would even want to hire him? 
297 Not all countries have Russia reputation for killing journalists and whistleblowers. 
2 That's what I was thinking the whole time I was watching Icarus and it was going through how pivotal he was throughout the whole fucking thing to Putin's conspiracy to dope athletes.  That is a LOT of fucking trust you're putting into one guy, who you probably don't even know well... and who is also living in a plain house/apartment and obviously not making a lot of money... aside from how much he values wealth, if he does at all.All it takes is one slight, or one moment of consciousness, and you can take the whole thing down.Some definite parallels to that are probably very present in Trump's circle as we speak.Of course, Putin just fucking whacks you when you turn on him, but yeah.
1 Yeah he’s the 21st century Solzhenitsyn.
2 What is WPP? 
-11 I think the average Russian is Pro-Russia, regardless of the circumstances behind it. The reality is most Americans would be the same, regardless of how sanctimonious people may act on Reddit.
195 I wouldn't be able to live with anyone that delusional..
21 Sounds like Trump and conservatives whining about the "evil liberal mass media" and throwing out all sorts of conspiracies 
3 FДKЗ NЗЩs!  FДKЗ NЗЩs!  FДKЗ NЗЩs!
1 It isn't just Russia, brother. We elected a sexual assault master who fabricates his own reality at will. 
1 She is kind of more right than wrong, but obviously each side exaggerates their version....have you seen the news lately? Just about every facet of American culture and news is in some way controlled by some abusive pervert. 
1 Sounds like my wife any time I bring up Dutuerte.(She's from the Philippines)
1 I, an American, am currently sitting with two Russian friends in Germany, talking and reading about this.  They don't believe it at all, and are trying to dismiss the whole thing.  I said, "do you really think the whole world is against you?"  They responded with, of course. 
1 Sounds kind of like turkey.
1 My mother grew up during Argentina during the Junta and really saw the worst of it. Many of my family members, uncles and aunts and cousins, just removed from record and existence. To this day she will insists no wrong, and is a strong “Las Isles Malvinas” supporter. You do what you can, love them, but I’ve always figured that if I don’t talk back and set the record straight, no one else will. It’s weird. 
1 >The evil Americans and Europeans are conspiring against Russia to destroy it, and we must unite as a country to not let them win.But well they are actually. US push with NATO, Russia answer - Russia baddies. US invade Syria, Russia helps Syria - Russia baddies. US support politics in Russia and Europe - OK, Russia doing this - baddies. Russia don't give a fuck about Baltics, Pentagon release article about Russia taking Baltics into 72 hours.It's just a geopolitics. By creating image of the enemy you win wars. The reason why Cold War was so succesful for US is because they created "Empire of Evil" as an image for USSR. It's just that everything that Russia do is a bad thing and everything US do is a good thing idea.For example RT called propaganda channel and registered as international agent - that's adequate reaction from Congress and US. Russia did the same for cheap shit propaganda channel like Radio Liberty - that's inadequate reaction from Russia and treat to freedom of speech and journalism. McCain seriously defended this channel and said that it uncover truth after multiple fakes it published in Russia, after it publish paid political content and after numerous programs that promote racism and xenophobia.It's actually amazing how hypocrisy is strong with West against Russia.Another example would be "artist" Pavlensky, he burned door of French bank in France and right now he is under investigation. None of politicians, none of other artists or actors have written letters in his support. However when he burned FSB door or nailed his balls sack to red square and got minor punishment for this - FSB door about 500k rubles fee and for red square he wasn't even punished for public behaviour. Shit tons of letters, constantly.Pussy Riot got praised for perfomance in Russian church, bashed for perfomance in Notre Dame. Femen praised for actions in Russia, bashed for the same in Italy and France.
-6 The sad thing is if you changed Russia to USA and it doesn't sound too weird 
1 > The evil Americans and Europeans are conspiring against Russia to destroy it, and we must unite as a country to not let them win.Evidently that's not the case, he tries to insist as his country's government supports anti-Russian opposition in Russia, along with supporting a coup in Russian analogue of Canada.>The local inhabitants have made thousands of videos of Russians soldiers.Show me them. Show me real, Russian army. Not volunteers on Russian-gifted tanks. >anti-russian rallies in Kiev (with like 40 people)Yeah guize, there was just 40 people in 2014 at Maidan, chanting 'Cut the Russians'! No thousands! Azov doesn't exist! Neither does Pravy Sector!You're either an idiot, or a shill. 
0 > My wife is Russian, and it's just impossible to discuss anything remotely related to politics without her dragging up insane conspiracy theories.Dude don't , just don't . Don't force a Russian women to chose between the Motherland and yourself . You don't wanna go there dude....bringing up politics in any relationship is nonsense tbh , your power to influence those things is basically limited to those 20 seconds you spend in the booth casting your vote...so you'd get into fights with people (in this case your wife) for no reason whatsoever .
9 Auto-complete strikes again. And no, I meant pompous. - Pompous -Characterized by excessive self-esteem or exaggerated dignity; pretentious: pompous officials who enjoy giving orders. - adj. - Full of high-sounding phrases; bombastic: a pompous proclamation. - adj. - Chracterized by pomp or stately display; ceremonious: a pompous occasion.I can't think of a better word for this given situation. In fact, it seems to sum up the Russian government and its attitude entirely.

1 I think you're being overly pedandic.
1 Wow, I'm usually the one to pick up on hilarious misspellings on Reddit, but you definitely win today's irony award for the manner in which you chose to correct OP on the spelling. Cut 'm a break, perhaps he's an Argentinian vaquero by day.At least your brief response wasn't pedantic.
1 Everyone thinks it is the right decision, everyone but but but but but Russia? ;)
1 You mean that period of boom and freedom for the Russian people after a long drawn out period of social, economic, cultural, and political isolation that drove them into the ground?Remember when it was illegal to own Jeans, or access foreign music, and people were shot for having an opinion? Pepperidge Farm definitely remembers.
12 [deleted]
5 I think it is beautiful. Russia deserves every bit of it. 
9 That’s not true. 
2 That's not true.It's also not about individual atheletes. It's about a state sponsored program. That's a big difference. 
1 It's like all you guys don't see that USA have it's own propaganda going on. And no i'm not from Russia. I just live in between these countries watching both sides hurl bullshit on us. 
1 This is nothing like the Harvey Weinstein situation. Harvey Weinstein would have to be in the middle of actively raping a woman while on the phone asking the police what they can do for him for these two situations to be even remotely similar.
1 Dude: no one gives a shit about your whataboutisms, we are having a conversation about Russia, Russian corruption, and Russia's shitty global behavior. 
1 Steroids should be legalized. Period. Been on them for two years now and my life is so much better for it. They're cheap, easy to find, easy to administer and they make you stronger, faster, hornier and more efficient in every way. They've killed only those who take them to the extreme (a handful of bodybuilders and powerlifters) but work wonders on those who use moderate dosages. The US has created an incredible stigma against them and has filled everyone's head with false propaganda. Some of you reading this are going to claim all sorts of negative side effects without actually linking a single scientific study all because your parents or the TV or some bullshit magazine article said so. Little do most people know, 95% of every male AND female body put on sports magazines, YouTube ads and Instagram fitness posts are all on some kind of anabolic steroid. The only people I've ever met who abused steroids were young men with shitty diets and poor work ethic and even then, they stopped taking them, their natural production of testosterone kicked back on and they went on with their life.Edit: That all being said, if all of the athletes are competing naturally and have signed an oath stating so, they should follow the rules. IMO, steroids should be legal and they should all be on them. 
135 I'd really like to know what a neutral uniform looks like. Solid grey?
3 "What makes a man turn Neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?"
0 NONE of them should get approval.  Everybody on the team must be punished so athletes have an incentive to rat out their own cheaters.
258 Yes, but it doesn't actually stop them from competing, so it's still impacting everyone else. And you can be sure everyone will know how many medals "Russia" wins.
8 Not really, Russia will claim all the medals anyways
1 Nationalistic country you say? Lmao I’ve never seen a Russian wearing those hideous flag pants 🇱🇷 or heard about the military paying to be part of sports events. Don’t get me wrong I’m not a Russia fan it’s just utterly bizarre to see this kind of finger pointing 
-2 Lol, we'll see what a shitshow that proves to be. STUFF THEM ENVELOPES
70 Absolutely, it’s a huge international embarrassment, especially for a country like Russia and Putin in particular. Also, only certain “clean” Russian athletes will be able to compete and I believe they have to be invited to compete by the IOC. So, the amount of Russian athletes in the games is sure to be greatly diminished and they’re all presumably be clean as well. 
1 > You can't see why maybe they'd be a little upset by it all?They abused their position as the host country at the Sochi Olympics to cheat.Yeah they're upset, but that's because it is an aspect of *some* russians to think they have some kind of god-given right to get away with anything - usually rationalizing it as part of their persecution complex
-2 Yes, I can see why. I also think it's not enough, because they're still able to send their athletes, just "not under their flag." Fucking lmao
1 I can assure you so does China. 
0 Yea there is. The puppet masters suck.
-1 >  Not sure who makes this determination,I'll give you a hint: a group notorious for accepting scrillions in bribes!
1 And everyone will still be able to tally the number of medals won by "Russian" athletes.
2 Badly, I expect.
2 Apparently it'll be the Olympic anthem.
1 [The neutral anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IizWc4cJwbw). 
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS7dPP_Df4g
1 Olympic anthem, apparently.
15 Clearly you haven't really read up on the story.  It was not individual athletes.  It was highly organized by national groups.
3 They were banned for having a systemic, state sponsored doping regiment, not because some athletes were caught   
2 Were they?  There is a fine line between choice and coercion when you are part of a national sports team.  Even more fine is the line when you deal with the rumors that abound about how things work in Russia.
1 The athletes aren't *all* being allowed in automatically. They have to appeal, and they're only supposed to get approval if they have a history of clean drug tests.And the country did fuck up. This went beyond just some athletes testing positive:>In an elaborate overnight operation at the 2014 Sochi Games, a team assembled by Russia’s sports ministry tampered with more than 100 urine samples to conceal evidence of top athletes’ steroid use throughout the course of competition.
1 The state sponsored the program and is absolutely responsible here.
1 It should be both.
1 Athletes and country are both in the wrong. The country facilitated the doping for the athletes. 
2 You cant do a study to show that its completely"safe". In order to to that, you would have to do a study measuring the effects of steroids against all of the thousands of possible human ailments, and then that still wouldn't measure for any possible new ailments exclusive to steroid use. The burden is on showing that it's unsafe, which admittedly I haven't investigated myself, but it's becoming common discussion that none has been produced. I'd like to see some though if they exist. Edit: not a scientific source but I just watched Bigger, Stronger, Faster documentary on Netflix. It just kinda fleshes out the situation as a whole in society. Pretty interesting.
2 Yes, it's definitely unfair when athletes who dope compete against athletes that don't. But again, if they aren't unsafe, and it's next to impossible to catch a significant portion of them, how could we possibly crack down on it, and why would we? 
1 The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon
1 Funny you suggest that, I'm already 40 minutes into it haha!
1 Do you give China the benefit of doubt?
1 There's been lots of individuals with other people involved in Olympic doping such as Victor Conte. China has state sponsored doping... or at least used to in the 80s and 90s https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/22/china-compulsory-doping-olympic-athletes-claims-whistleblower-athleticsThese whistleblowers claim China was running similar programs during the Beijing olympics. The head of anti-doping in a nordic country supposedly lives in a massive mansion that exceeds the wealth his position would be able to afford without bribes. 
6 There are conspiracies that the miracle on ice was some sort of government plot in order to undermine Soviet Russia. Accusations ranging from steroids, bribing refs, drugging the Russian players, etc.I love conspiracies, but personally dont think the evidence is really there. Maybe some steroid issues. But nothing that suggest state sponsored, and likely used by both teams.
132 This was somehow an effective recommendation and now I'm going to watch this movie.
21 Is that the one with Paul Giamatti? That man is a treasure.
48 That was one of the most unwatchably bad movies I've ever seen. It's the one that finally convinced me not to even attempt to watch Shyamalan movies anymore. Edit: now that I think about it, I also saw The Happening after Lady in the Water, for some reason. It was also awful. I guess those two combined made me swear off Shamalamadingdong. I've heard that Split is good, but I just don't think I'm ever going to bother seeing it.
2 That one scene with the naked pool party was pretty good, but other than that not great. 
2 Check out Full Metal Jacket while you're at it. Great movie.
1 Are we doing suggestions?Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D is mine then. Season 5 just started, and its one hell of a crazy ride since Season 1.
1 It is not an ok movie. It's an absolute clusterfuck.
1 Really? I was pretty young when it came out and even so, judging from the advertisements, it looked ridiculously bad.
3 That movie is actually super okay.
2 I would then suggest everyone watch *Point Break*, the original, with Keaneau Reeves and Patrick Swayze. it's a great heist movie and it also has flea in it.
2 Bro that movie was definitely not ok
1 You know that dude was doping, but only for one of his arms.
1 I recommend your recommendation.
40 I must break you.
3 Like Doughboy to Dre.
1 If I's can learns to love yous and yous can learns to love me....Oh fuck. Where was I?
1 I mean, he wasn't wrong.
1 But first he'll live.
2 oh man, I feel for you. Because of things like Olympic Boxing, it is really hard to take it seriously as a sport with any integrity. It's just so corrupt
1 Exactly. The tests aren't hard to beat for the athletes and coaches that know what they're doing. 
1 That doesn’t mean they don’t dope. That just means the government isn’t knowingly endorsing and funding it.
1 Or they haven't been caught. May not be state sponsored, but you can bet that plenty of other countries have athletes using PEDs. 
7 If you've seen Icarus then you know the tests don't mean shit.
1 The tests might as well have been designed to cheat though. It’s *super* easy to get around the test.
1 1. God is a manmade construct and not relevant here.2. While the U.S. has fallen behind in cyberwarfare, its fieldcraft is still very good.
137 Only the clean athletes get to compete.  You trying to tell me Zarya's not juicing?
7 They'd never be anything other than bland and safe with references to international politics like this.
5 I thought I wasn’t in the wrong sub for a moment  
1 White team Zarya is best Zarya
1 She already has her goth outfit. What more do you want?!?!
142 I think you *should* be less proud to represent your country if your country systematically cheats like that.  It sucks for those clean athletes but actions have consequences.
1 A lot of the Olympics is commercialism and exchanging gobs of money under the table.    ftfy
1 Also competing while being doped does lose some of the Olympic spirit, tho.
1 Probably messes up training funding too. Is a host county going to find you when you can’t represent them?
1 you should instead feel bad for the people who lost to russian dopers in the previous olympics.
-1 I don't think you should have any national pride when your country got caught cheating. I would want to cover my face and look away from embarrassment.
3 For Russians on doping allegations, yes. They used up any benefit of the doubt. Russians should have to do more to prove they're clean at this point, it's been going on for decades across all sports and thousands of athletes.
1 84
1 Except bodybuilding, those guys are all natural. /s
6 That is harsh for the teams that competed clean
1 > > Edit: they can't form a team under a neutral flagSo no one Russian, even clean, will participate in team games?
2 The KHL is an IIHF member and so in theory the IIHF can force them to allow their players to go. In practice we'll see how well that goes. I think there's already a rumor that the KHL will leave the IIHF.
1 They actually can't by the their own rules. So all foreign players are free to go to olympics
1 I agree with this and I imagine Putin will try to do same with the individual athletes. May see an attempted full boycott
105 His actions may have destabilized the US and Britain, but China and Europe are stronger than ever.
1 Yeah, he had a hand in electing Trump. That's kinda a huge deal.
1 How is that not a success? Hes weakening their most important rival.
1 How have they? (Legit question) 
1 Mission accomplished.  The US has never appeared worse.  Never.
1 The difference is nukes.
1 Oh, on that measurement, Murica is as powerful as ever. Thanks to Donald J. Trump ofc.
10 Their economy is in shambles compared to the rest of the world. I'm pretty sure the state of california has a bigger GDP than Russia. 
5 What did they gain from all this? That people talk about them? That's no use in a few years.The bots influencing other countries? If the US finds out how much they interfered and actively undoes the Trump shit they will face massive repercussions for this. And other countries that are afflicted might also worsen their diplomacy with them majorlyEconomical power? Russia is in a pretty dire economical state currently and further sanctions might wreck themLand? He took Crimea but that caused him way more harm then use. The fact that he basically pissed of the whole western block with this and the countries still sanction russia until he gives it back will make this way more costly then it will bring use to russia.Having deeper ties with countries like China or Turkey? Turkey itself has a good chance to crash and burn the next years and China will not think twice about throwing russia under a train if it helps them. China has always been as neutral as possible towards the major players and if russia would force them to play a hand it would not be against the world in favor of Putin and friends, that much is clear...Everything Putin is building for Russia is a complete castle in the air. He thinks that people will respect russia for this or that he can force russia back into a leading position but as soon as the gas dependency in europe will be gone russia will become a complete non-issue in global politics. And the way Putin moves the country it might even happen faster if the rest of the world gets too fed up with his bullshit
5 Their main resource is oil, which is lower than it was, therefore they have a weaker economy. This is amplified by sanctions Obama placed on them before he left office because of the election involvement.  They also now have a massive light shining on their practices, many countries are bolstering their defenses and unifying against them.  Also, China has taken the opportunity to strengthen their grips in Asia and Africa, providing infrastructure for profit and power.  How are they ahead again?  
2 Russia has a tiny GDP compared to way smaller countries, and yet they are a key/central player in geopolitics. Putin has done extremely well in keeping Russia relevant. Consider how much you hear about Russia in international politics, and how much influence they have, when Italy, Korea, Brazil and Canada have larger GDP's than them. The only reason they are where they are is because of propaganda and manipulation. It's how they've maintained control on the international stage, when they've largely fallen behind since the Cold War. It's all they've got at this point, so it's not surprising they are starting to get caught so much. 
21 True. And it's not just Russia. Freedom House is an organization that evaluates "Freedom in the World" to track global trends since 1973. They look at the electoral process, political pluralism/participation, functioning of the gov, freedom of expression and belief, associational and organizational rights, rule of law, and personal autonomy and individual rights. 2016 was the 11th consecutive year with a decline in global freedom. Typically autocratic and countries labeled "partially free" see a decline, but in 2016 25% of countries that saw declines were labeled "free" democracies. Including Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Poland, Spain, South Korea, the United States and multiple others. 67 countries saw net declines. In fact, Free countries accounted for a larger share of the countries with declines than at any time in the past decade. >In 2016, populist and nationalist political forces made astonishing gains in democratic states, while authoritarian powers engaged in brazen acts of aggression, and grave atrocities went unanswered in war zones across two continents. >All these developments point to a growing danger that the international order of the last quarter-century - rooted in the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law - will give way to a world in which individual leaders and nations pursue their own narrow interests without meaningful constraints, and without regard for the shared benefits of global peace, freedom, and prosperity. Ugh sorry for rambling on, but like many others (especially those interested in international relations / world politics) I've had a growing sense of major dread and concern for our future. 
15 Not really.Say what you will about communist leaders, but the income inequality and living conditions in the Soviet Union really were *extremely* modest by current standards.This popular idea that all the leaders and their friends were living like kings is just not remotely true. Pretty much all evidence suggests that they really were true believers for the most part, and their economic situations largely reflected that.There was definitely some corruption, like there always is, there were definitely some economic perks, and some of the dachas were quite large and expensive (using the same justification as for most democratic leader mansions today - diplomatic functions), but the income spread really was comparatively small and the normal apartments and living situation of the party leaders really were pretty modest.
1 Its pretty staggering inmareica..though that was what made america "great"back in the late 50's was the (temporary) income equality.Its all gone downhill since imo.

8 People are willing to put up with a lot of bullshit until you fuck with their wallet or leisure activities. 
2 Russia's success is Sochi actually helped Putin to consolidate much of his power; he was not nearly as popular before. He immediately translated that new support into his adventure in Ukraine. Now that something is actually happening because of their state-sponsored doping program, maybe he loses some of the popular support he won through international sport.
2 Look how long the North Korean regime has lasted. Governments that are concerned *only* with holding on to power (as opposed to, say, promoting the interests of their citizens) can get really, really good at it.North Korea has benefited from Chinese support because of its strategic location. Russia has plenty of oil and natural gas, which also assures it of plenty of foreign support, as with Saudi Arabia.
33 Having read the BBC article on the subject, that is pretty much exactly the Russian MPs /heads of committees etc are saying...That Russia has done nothing wrong and this is the wests pathetic attempt to remove them from sporting glory
4 Current? I would say this has been going on the past 50+ years. Russians developed such mentality that they must be the best and if they are not, it means somebody cheated them or it was somehow unfair. Like the riots when Ukraine won Eurovision and Russia came behind. So much critique that it was political, staged, Russian singer clearly better etc. They are very sore losers that I've never seen in other countries.
1 waiting for Trump to tweet out his support for those poor Russians. 
1 It's true.  Russians laugh when you call them cheaters.  They see cheating as a smart thing to get around obstacles is a challenge.  No actual moral compass there either.  Certainly no fairness or open mindedness.  Maybe there'd be hope if they treated their womem and homosexuals fairly.  But right now, it aint gonna happen in our lifetimes.  Which is a shame bc their artistic flavor and intelligence are spectacular.  If they would only be serious about human rights.  Thats the key.
27 Some guy named Vadim Butin probably, Just Putin with a mustache.
7 IF he somehow got unseated, which is about as likely as hell freezing over, it'd probably be Surkov or Medvedev. However, they would not have nearly the cult like following he has, it would be big blow to Russian authoritarianism. Many people are loyal to Putin first, and all the ones like the siloviki and oligarchs won't be loyal to anyone else unless they are facing prison time. Putin is the string that hold the whole thing together. As soon as Putin goes down, everyone is going to prison. 
3 Yes but that happened with the death of Stalin too. It still weakened the USSR significantly to have an incompetent dictator replace a crazy guy who knew what he was doing.
2 Well that's who Medvedev was..
1 Hopefully eaten by a dancing bear. 
6 I think it is becoming less and less relevant since the “brand” of the olympics has been ruined by doping scandals and wide spread corruption seen in the IOC. We’re also in a world of fast media so I don’t think the world tunes into the olympics as much as they did a decade ago when that was “the only thing on”. I certainly didn’t watch sochi or very much of the last summer games. 
1 Right.  I'm pretty sure I've read studies that show a demonstrable improvement in national economies when their athletes do well.The Olympics is serious stuff.
2 The olympics are all about projecting russiaas some major power.I have no doubt that they spent hundreds of millions if not billions to help turn the tide of the 2016 election.There is a reason that Russia is the greatest geopolitical enemy of the US. Obama tried to collaborate with Putin and  was spit on. http://www.eurasia.org/NewAndUpdates/building-us-russia-university-partnerships-ground
1 It's all subjective to an individuals opinion. As someone who doesn't like competitions and have very little pride in my country these last few years it's pretty trivial.To sports fans, gamblers, patriots, Athletes, and corrupt politicians who want to take land from poor people (Brazil) and do an abysmal job at hosting the Olympics then it isn't a trivial thing.
1 Okay, Mr. Olympics! Sorry for besmirching your family name!
-7 In the grand scheme of things, pretty trivial.
4 I don't think the person you're replying to claimed he did any good.
1 As someone who lives in Russia, Putin did a lot of good at the start of his presidency, but recently he has done absolutely nothing for the Russian people. 
1 Please don't tell me that you are talking about navalny. Look a little bit into his past and you will see that he is nearly as racist as Trump.
1 No presidential candidate or anyone who intended to run for president was assassinated. The opposition isn't getting destroyed with force, it's simply being rooted out before it can do anything. The whole field is not friendly to new players, with TV and news being barred to them. Young and capable often go against each other. You cannot run a country as big as Russia without experience. I doubt anyone below 50 is gonna be capable. Elections in Russia aren't really rigged. There's no need to rig them. Not directly. People do vote for Putin, the votes aren't fake. The problem, as I've said, is the lack of alternatives. And while I would love peace and cooperation, I also have no wish for my country to bend over for Europe and the US. Because that's what "cooperation" means in the western political jargon. The relationship will have to be on equal footing, and EU and US won't like that. They liked Russia under Yeltsin, Russia that did whatever the US wanted and asked for more. I think the main reason Putin is disliked in the West isn't because he's really bad (because while he's no saint, he is no devil either, no matter what western media says). It's because he's not complying. Cooperation is great. But only in the word's literal meaning. 
7 Your comments sound like your knowledge of Russia's history is based on newspaper headlines alone. Either way, that doesn't actually answer what /u/RobotWantsKitty said. Russia was not a world power in the 90s as you claim, and just as u/_il_mostro_ said Putin did not create the situation, and certainly not responsible for the existence of the "mafia state".
2 You didn't live in Russia in 90s, did you. 
1 Oh Piss off. The man's a monster.
3 Very true, as I said I detest Putin. However, if you consider the economic improvements, added on with the propaganda machine that Russia has, it's not hard to see why so many Russians still believe Putin is the answer to their problems.   Again as I said though, its questionable how much of that economy was actually Putin as opposed to just lucking out on oil prices going up. If you look at oil prices from the late 90's when to took over, and compare it to the Russian Economy, the graphs almost line up completely
0 It was for sure but Russia was not a world power when Putin took over in 1999. Yeltsin had nearly run it into the ground. Putin has inarguably improves Russia from that period. 
-13 [deleted]
5 They seize sovereign land with impunity so they still have some power. They are still one of a handful of nuclear powers and as such are a permanent world power.
1 Yeah, guys, the US had nothing to do with it! Yeltsin, too! It's all Putin! He ruled Russia since 1991!
-8 [deleted]
1 I'm not propping him in any way. He is a piece of shit - agreed. But we have to give credit where credit's due. His involvement in Syria is complicated for us to really understand, but we saw what happened after Gadaffi got taken out.
1 no actually if you look at the caps super zoomed, there is a very thin slice meaning they were cracked open and put back together.  thats how it was originally proved that they were tampered with.  I believe they show it on Icarus
1 swapped containrs is a result of sick brain of Rodchinkov, who will tell US gov. whatere they want for money. Because the transfer of containers is juridical procedure under observation, with with protection from any possible machinations, and transfer receipt. Also, any doping test can detect the doping wich was used once 6+ months before test itself. When should they collect 10 liters of urina? At the age of 15 to use it for dopping? Because sprotsmen pass tests many times a yaer.It's a fake for western auditory, which believes everything agains Russia and relishes it. 
227 Trump: "VERY STUPID IOC ruled Russia not allowed to Olympics but Russia didn't want to go to there anyway. IOC uninvited to my CHRISTMAS party. SAD!"
37 Hadn't even thought of that, Jesus. The tweets will be incredible
3 I fully expect Trump to pull the USA out of the Winter Olympics out of solidarity with ~~our~~ his Russian friends.
1 "IOC is like Crooked Hillary, keeping good Russians down! Where is real leadership like my good friend Sepp Blatter at FIFA? SAD!!!"
1 If Trump can't help Russia enjoy Olympic gold, then Russia releases videos of Trump enjoying golden showers.
0 Why would he do that?
2 You ban a nation when that nation had a state-sponsored cheating program. They're not being punished for their actions on the world stage or their politics. They're being punished specifically for their actions at the Olympics themselves, as a state.Seems completely reasonable to me.
2 >The IOC could have just penalized each Russian athlete when they were found for doping.But the program was run by the state. The Russian government themselves were cheating. Not just the athletes. How does punishing a few athletes send an appropriate message against the country as a whole and the government that ran such a crazy cheating program?
1 Fogel bought the ticket for him to leave Russia, found him lawyers, Rodchenkov stayed with Fogel for a while
-4 How is he defending them? He merely told you pretty much every country uses doping, which they are. 
-6 Why are you saying he's defending them? Probably just making sure you're adequately informed.

2 The ISU has to formally accept teams and they would play under OAR (Olympic athletes from Russia)
1 Well, that was awkward.
1 Yes, pre war, but Hitler was already in power, which is what he was referring to I assume
1 It was the Nazis though, Hitler had made Germany a dictatorship under one party (NSDAP) rule by the end of 1933. The latest you could probably say it became officially a dictatorship was 1935.
1 Racism and antisemitism were much more acceptable back then. Being an open anti semite wasn't a big deal
1 Eugenics was a progressive ideal back then.  I don't think racism or antisemitism was a big problem.
3 Open secret:The idea of honor only counts when it's within plain view.Hence the concept of "what we do in the dark" being the more useful barometer for morality. It's only moral if there is no reward or recognition for doing the moral thing.
1 Yeah, and he killed Hitler too! Good guy.
1 Not a chip on the shoulder just tired of hyporcrisy. For years americans have been bombing people in countries unable to respond in any other way but terrorism. For years they have been killing innocent people, bombing civilians by "mistake" killing hundreds at least and probably thousands. And so far the reaction was "well it's bad but oh well shit happens". Russians start doing the same thing in Syria for far shorter amount of time and suddenly there is an article every month calling russians  murderers and saying they have commuted a new "atrocity" while americans keep bombing and killing at the same rate and no one bats an eye. It's been known for years that Saudi's have been financing terrorists for years and yet they seem to be the best friend with US. American interventions in Libya and Syria have caused a new wave of terrorist organisations that have basically been able to run around those countries unchecked because americans helped to destroy the original governments. And yet when people try to leave those countries and head for safer part of the world people blame russia for causing a refugee crisis. What I want is not to somehow exonerate russia, but simply have other people take a look at what other countries are doing and really think about what those actions have done. Double standards are a plague on this world. Legal corruption is still corruption, hypocrisy no matter how noble your goal is dangerous. Attempts to rewrite history are even more dangerous. All of that is currently going on and yet everyone keeps going on about how "bad" and "evil" russians are. 
1 just read up on the other sportsmen and sportswomen who have been caught cheating already, then extrapolate why they have been(change in protocols of testing, new methadology, someone saying something) and voila you have your evidence
1 Not sure what you're talking about. The fact that a Holocaust was even occurring wasn't discovered until [well after the war](https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=136) had started. The extent of it wasn't even fully realized until the 50s.
1 Shot themselves in the back of the head 
1 That was almost an exact Trump quote though, from when he was defending a pedophile.>“[Moore] denies it. Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen. You’re talking about … he said 40 years ago this did not happen.
1 It's not like Russia is sending out athletes like soldiers and pumping them with roids. Individuals were caught and as a whole Russia was banned. But the clean Russians can still participate just not under Russian colors. 
1 So does that mean that the South Koreans bribed them ? 
1 Oh that makes sense.. I didn't realize they would be taking supplements and IVs. Yeah, it would be really easy for the staff / coaches / whoever is in charge to give them a bit of illegal stuff. 
1 Wow, reading through your account, it's actually the amazing case of a russian troll who admits they're russian? Maybe even an unpaid russian troll who drinks the kool-aid?
4 Ok yeah sure they do.
1 If doping was confined to one or two countries, wouldn't they win everything?
7 Curlers are definately not natty. Have you seen those ‘ceps, brah? 
-3 [deleted]
-10 Maybe not state sponsored, but it doesn't look like they are doingmuch other than watching the ball-and-shell game that is testing,and are perfectly content with victories.Probably the statistical: That countries which are "not" doping are successfully competing with and exceeding those that are chemically verified to be.And the economical:The cost of chemical is << than the reward of sponsorships, good press, and all the other monetary benefits that come with good press and publicity.And the psychological:Every possibility for an edge, or you're out.*shrug*
4 Was only commenting on this guys admission of China.
-10 I agree that the systemic doping in Sochi was next level but guaranteed there's systemic doping in the States as well with coaches, doctors etc working hard to keep their athletes testing clean. 
3 That's the 80s and 90s though, /u/Gankdatnoob said China should be banned, which implies the present time. If there's no evidence of state sponsored doping in recent or current olympics, I don't think they should be banned. They have individual athletes that dope, but that's [hardly special to China.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stripped_Olympic_medals)
2 They all doping to some degree. Look at the incredible shit athletes do these days and I think their all on some gear. 
2 I see. Haven't heard much about the Chinese doping but then again, there wasn't really a documentary made about it. 
13 Track and Field Team was completely banned....Swimmers were almost completely banned as well....So I don't know about that weakness part. Just FYI, a lot of athletes were banned from competing who had decade long history of drug free performance and who were very obviously not doping. 
6 The McLaren report came after the Rio Olympics. (Edit: half wrong pt1 was July 2016, pt2 was Dec 2016)  All Russian athletes were heavily tested going into the Rio games because of the 2014 documentary and then the May 2016 Times article which revealed the Rodchenkov stuff.  Since then, the punishments have been swift and severe.  Banning a country from competing is serious and normally reserved for losers of world wars or countries who violate human rights or support regimes who do so.  Correct me if I am wrong about any of this.Personally, I think they had to build a case, they had the athletes interests in mind, and banning a country is not taken lightly.  Why Russia was even awarded an Olympics is beyond me.
-1 Let me explain on examples. I have no issue with for example France suing Russian senator for tax evasions ( this happened in France). But it's not like he has his oligarchic privileges in France. Why you use that word ? He isn't French oligarch.What I do mind is USA meddling in 1996 Russian presidential elections ( and then boasting about it in Time magazine). Not mentioning that the whole Russian oligarchic state is a result of economic policies that where implemented by USA advisers and how privatization was handled. I would've thought that was libertarian idiots who were just confused by their theories if in other post Soviet countries other privatization policies were advised ( like you know Estonia). And surprise surprise no oligarchs.
1 I have no issue about discussing Russian oligarchs. I have issue with people trying to shame me as is in "have to be humiliated". Fuck off you don't tell me how I must feel. > At that point, countries have to decide how to react to it,And they reacted in their jurisdiction. What the problem ?
1 Yep. This current situation is at least partly result of USA internal politics.Without Bush invasion in Iraq oil prices wouldn't be so high and Putin wouldn't be hailed for bringing prosperity to Russia. Also if Bush wouldn't pull out of anti-missile ballistic treaty Russia wouldn't be so nervous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt2u4dlZBHEWithout PATRIOT act there wouldn't be Snowden ( who is currently in Russia which is not really USA - Russia relationship)I am not even talking about botched privatization in Russia ( brought to us by US advisers) which led to this whole oligarhyc thing, and Kosovo So if you looking at solution to Russian problem you may have to look closely to home.

2 Admittedly it was more of a dribble, but the effect was the same: a coffee and slobber covered keyboard
37 And the ones who aren't Russian are largely pro-Russia for the simple fact that Donald Trump inexplicably has a huge boner for Vladimir Putin.
1 Ah, another conspiracy theorist. Still chasing that Russian bogeyman? 
1 "BUT MUH RUSSIA" fuck off, we both know that they didn't do shit in the election and you are just butthurt because the better candidate won
0 Actually the difference is that we don't know about other countries but we do know about Russia, as i said was dumb enough to get caught. 
19 Doping can help with focus, dexterity and endurance during practice and during a competition. It's not just about strength when it comes to doping
18 Nonsense. There’s lots of different kinds of Doping. It’s not all pure muscle and endurance enhancement . Some Doping lets the body recover faster after training sessions, enabling an athlete to train harder and more often, which in turn improves his skills faster than a competitor that hasn’t doped while training.
6 Not true. Doping isn't all anabolic steroids for strength gain. It could be blood doping, which increases endurance and reduces fatigue meaning more time for training than an legit athlete.
2 No its not lol figure skating is just as physical as any other sport. 
2 thats not true at all
4 Interestingly, I just wrote a few comments about fixed judging scandals in figure skating just now before I saw these comments. The fact is that the Russians have been complicit in so many fixed judging scandals in figure skating and have been recorded on phone and video to cheat.
4 What other skaters do has nothing to do with whether it is appropriate for Russian skaters to cheat. So much fucking whataboutism in this thread. 
2 STOP. 
1 You PutinBots aren't even trying to be subtle.
2 We'll find out soon enough. 
18 NHL owners wants money from the IOC to allow their players to compete. They never got to a deal so the pro players will not compete in the Olympics. Fucking assholes. 
6 I think it's actually the NHL's rules that are prohibiting players from going in 2018
5 It was the NHL's decision not to participate.  Though they made the decision in part because they couldn't get the concessions they wanted from the IOC.
6 no. NHL commish (Bettman) and the NHL owners couldn't reach a deal with the IOC to let NHL players compete in the olympics. so it was just going to be a ton of semi-professional players going.
1 Slovakia without NHL players most of the time isn't even top10 team (see results in WC). 
3 Russia was the clear favorite until today. There is a decent number of NHL or almost-NHL level Russian players in the KHL. Sweden is probably the favorite now but by a slimmer margin. The European leagues have some good North American talent but tend to skew towards their own and the SHL is the next best league.
3 I think it's a bit of overstatement. 
4 Seriously I did not expect this many people to just be down for giving Russia a pass on this.Apparently they can do no wrong at this point, the way some of these ~~people~~ bots talk about them.
-1 Better allow ALL THE DOPING and see the full potential of the human body and human ingenuity combined. Of course there should be an "if a participant dies or is significantly injured during or, a considerable amount of time, after the olympics, the participant shall be disqualified and return the medals to the next winner"-clause
-14 So we should only let Americans and Chinese people use doping? 
-1 Of what?Lance was tested more than any athlete in history and never failed a test.He was doped to the gills.
-1 That we know of...We didn't know that the heads of US Gymnastics were routinely ignoring reports of sexual abuse either.
1 Yep.Everyone watched Icarus so they think they're experts.
1 BS.Look to US Gymnastics for ethics.What's worse adult athletes unknowingly doping or sexual abuse of children?
1 we need more people like you
-1 How would you know? The whole point is that there had to be a whistleblower to expose the situation. Something like this is obviously going to be extremely secret. How can you know that "few have a state-sponsored doping system in place"? Maybe none of them do, maybe it's just Russia. Or maybe all of them do. 
5 I guess if we're being fair to FIFA in this case, the World Cup was given to Russia way before this particular case which caused the IOC to do this ban. Russia was given the World Cup back in 2010 and while I don't doubt that they probably have been running some sort of doping program far longer than for the Sochi Olympics it hadn't been uncovered in 2010. I don't think FIFA really cares about this case anyway and it's too late to change the venues now since the World Cup is only 6 months away. 
1 While that may be true, FIFA needs to run that investigation. Each should stand on their own merits. 
1 Your statement: X is bad.My statement: Y is worse than X.Bam and that's whatabaoutism. I like how you people recently learned that word, sad thing that once the Russian olgino troll scare disappears you'll forget it.
1 Feel da ryhtmFeel da rhymeGet on up, it's Bobsled time
12 Don't forget the start is vital to sled sports. Dope a sprinter to the gills means they can carry more momentum into the course.
-30 Lol, it doesn't make any sense at all.Edit: OK, TIL on the alcohol improving shooting accuracy, but that doesn't mean juicing helps you with "concentration, focus, and strategy" or that getting drunk would help you in *bobsledding* or whatever /u/DNVR1345 is implying. PEDs help Bobsledding, because you sprint with the sled to start, not because steroids make you a better driver, FFS.
12 It would only be a double standard if male, or other athletes, could not take ADHD drugs. 
1 So you're saying the US has facilities specially built by the government just to falsify doping tests?
1 Yup, while refreshing my memory [i found this graphic from the New York Times showing well how they was actually doing it](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html).If Russian officials had no idea it was happening and they'd still implemented all the checks and security it wouldn't be anywhere near as big as it is now.
1 No one said all of russia is doping.  The olympic committee decided russia's previous attempts to gain an unfair advantage using drug enhanced athletes warranted a harsher punishment.
1 The Mcclaren report is incomplete.Enlighten yourself.Don't ignore the major political issues at hand.
1 Nope, just the end of the olympics.
36 > Not sure what that has to do with doping.Only if your reading comprehension skills are lacking.
27 It has everything to do with doping. You clearly didn't read the article and are still trying to push a false equivalency.
21 Ok, I’ll explain it to you like you’re special:On one hand, you have teams who hire specialists to try to teach athletes to do doping without getting caught, on the other hand, you have **a country who ordered one of it’s intelligence agencies to provide and cover their athletes with doping, while simultaneously being on the anti dopping comittee**Now go in the corner and put the special hat on, you’re grounded
26 >Show me another country who used their intelligence agencies to help their athletes cheat and then lie about it and also assassinate whistleblowersIt seems pretty relevant to doping tbh
25 Lol, do you even know the situation and why IOC banned Russia? 
10 Russia was promoting doping *at a government level*.
1 Shit troll is shit.
1 are you retarded
1 Ain't wrong, but it's a poor defense of Russia.
1 The classic pivot.
1 Don't make claims you can't back up with evidence. Super simple idea.
21 A state sponsored program with 100's of agent's tampering with samples during an event they hosted? Yeah, I think they're the only ones to do that. Dumb fucks 
1 His username does not check out.
1 Another retard checks my comment history. How come i don't do that? How come i don't feel the need to justify my vote by searching for something incriminating in peoples comment history?
1 American track and field. The amount of athletes who we have had be exposed is terrible. You think they are funding the doping themselves? No, it's their coaches etc who getting them it and using money from the company which happens to be U.S. Fuck I already know I'm going to get downvoted due to morons just not accepting that doping is incredibly *normal* in high level sport. And the money for it doesn't come from some poorly paid athlete. Like, wakey wakey people. Seriously. Russia have done it and got exposed. It is comical to think it's not absolutely everywhere. 
-7 Well realistically I think it would be naive to think that doping is only "individual athletes gone wrong". It's such a huge business with contacts all over. For example Finlands cross country ski team were all using back in 2001 (Lahti), a lot of jamaicans have been caught and a lot of developing countries get caught all the time because they don't have the resources to use non-identifiable doping and have to use easy-to-detect-doping (like EPO). And again, I'm Not saying that Russia is fault-free, but not allowing them to participate in the olympics is a political, if not hypocritical move.
10 Can you define "similar"? Did you even read the article?: Russia literally set up a separate facility next to the anti-doping laboratory in Sochi, in order to replace hundreds of dirty urine samples:https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/05/13/sochi-doping/de19d9bedbf824974ca4f657d90cb653f0dc6859/floorplan-960.pngIf you have any evidence that the United States has done anything similar to an operation of this scale, then please provide it. You don't win an argument by making baseless accusations with no facts to back it up.
1 The downhill skiing is pretty neat. 🎿 ⛰ 
5 You're a hockey fan so obviously you feel that way. I'm not a hockey fan so I'm super stoked for the Olympics.
1 I'm all about the skiing, my dude. Don't really give a shit about hockey.
1 I've never been interested in hockey at the Winter Olympics. If you would consider switching out of your perspective you'd realise a lot of people in other countries, where ice hockey is not very popular, watch the Winter Olympics too.Image from business insider showing the most popular event by country:http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52fe170d6bb3f79209063b84-1200-/olympic-buzz-map.jpg

1 I asked a question. You can't answer it. Beyond sanctions the only other recourse are insults and military action. But I'm the idiot? How about you quit whining about the lack of US response and enlighten us with a better alternative? You can't. You're on Reddit to bloviate and namecall when others call you out on your own stupidity.
1 You can't make the argument that everyone participating knows the risks when the Russians participating in the Olympics know full well the risks of breaking the rules and getting caught.You can't seriously compare a teenager smoking pot to doping a hundred athletes, tampering with their samples and invalidating the hard work of every other honest athlete at the Olympics. What kind of straw man is that?The Russians chose to attend the Olympics voluntarily. If you think the rules are stupid don't play the game.
2 BALCO involved a handful of individual athletes. There is zero evidence that the US government as an entity engaged in a widespread cheating regime. The two aren't remotely comparable.
2 I kind of love watching curling, actually... I've noticed them getting more fit as you said and can see why that helps with control and mobility, but man that team is jacked!   Honest question: does that actually help or do they just like lifting for the sake of it?
2 The NHL and IOC couldn't come to terms on an agreement this Olympics. A big point was that the NHL would have to give up revenue, disrupt the regular schedule and risk player injury. The IOC refused to cover insurance for players, so the NHL decided to not go.
1 Because the NHL wont let them go to the Olympics.
743 It's going to be exactly that. College kids and NHL busts playing in Europe. Not sure if the ban extends to the AHL or Juniors, but I would imagine the AHL is since it's the main feeder for the NHL.
151 QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!
35 The "good old days" only ended in 1998. That was the first winter games with NHLers. 
25 I mean that would have been a joke of a concept but if the KHL moves to pull out as well it'd make for a very interesting and almost purely amateur tournament.
5 Perhaps we will go back to the good ole days. Chariot racing.
5 It will never go back to the good old days.  The thing that was great about 1980 was it was a rag tag bunch of college kids against a legitimate professional team that just got done whooping the ass of the NHL all star team.No such team exists anymore, so it will just be amateurs against amateurs and pretty much the exact same tournament as the World Junior tournament that happens every December. 
13 Yeah the good old days.  Let's watch the olympics not to see the best athletes in the world.  Great idea.
3 I'd rather have the best players competing the Olympics. 
1 I would rather see Crosby and McJesus on the same team to be honest.
5 That's not what the Olympics is all about. Making it big IS the Olympics. It's supposed to be the highest tier of competition there is.
9 those werent "the good ole days". Why would I want to watch players who aren't the best compete for the title of being the best?
2 Wait, what? Amateurs competing in a global sporting event, you say? You speak of madness! How could they keep up viewership without NBC filling close to 35% of their programming time with the same six commercials and filling 20% of the remaining airtime with personal interest sob stories of athletes overcoming great obstacles to train and participate, leaving the remaining airtime to focus on runs from America's premier skiers ranked 22nd and 42nd in the world, plus the three winners, the American two man luge ranked 12th in the world, plus the winners, the American women's two most likely biathalon entrants, plus the winners....and to keep production costs, they'd have to demote the most interesting announcer of the entire crew from the 1am telecast and simply play a remix of the earlier footage, plus 15% more commercials.Naw, nobody'd be stupid enough to threaten their viewership with a dumb business strategy like that every four years...
2 The World Juniors are a good example of this.  Generally clean good hockey with young kids trying to prove themselves.  On par with Olympic hockey.
1 I liked the Olympic hockey better then.
1 so vegas?
1 To be fair ever since the Soviet Union joined the Olympics the idea of amateurism was gone. 
1 No other country does it and only a few sports do that, so why?
1 OLDE TYME HOCKEY
1 Canada could just send there house team from the airforce. 
1 Quack. 
1 Fuck it. Let's do Miracle 2.0
1 We have that. It's the world Juniors and it starts in a couple weeks! Runs every year around this time
1 I think Gary Bettman made the right call pulling the NHL'ers out of the Winter games.  Unfortunately for the Olympics hockey is #1 or #2 in terms of both TV eyes and ticket sales.  What's interesting is that he suggested they move hockey to the summer games, saying if that happened he would allow the players could go play. At first they laughed at him, but I'm sure they will look at the $ difference this year and could sing a different tune....
1 Kraft Hockey^^TM !
1 Knuckle pucks and flying V’s? I think so!
1 Put me in coach. 
228 Well yeah. The IOC makes shit ton off hockey in the Winter Olympics. The players see none of it, the NHL sees none of it even though they own the rights to these players etc. NHL even asked to be a partner or be able to use some of the footage of their players at the olympics. Nope.The NHL assumes all the risk, the IOC gets ALL the reward.
67 The money the NHL wanted was insurance, cost of travel, and housing for the players. All of which are reasonable requests which the IOC has happily paid in the past. Especially given the risk of a career ending injury (which can be franchise altering) in any single game. 
32 It’s a fair reason though. Their players could easily get hurt and miss time at their actual job, which hurts the owners and the team. NBA player Paul George missed almost the entire season a few years ago with an injury suffered in Olympic practice play.
5 Sure, but it's not like the IOC is about anything else either. The IOC is the one making hundreds of millions off the backs of the players, and their priority has been to hang onto every penny rather than to cover share some of the player costs. 
6 Also the ioc licenses all of the Olympic footage so the NHL can't use any of the Olympic footage for any promotional purposes of its stars. For instance when Crosby scored the golden gold in Vancouver, NHL can't use any of that. Also the hockey federations of most countries offered to foot the bill for the insurance for players but the NHL declined because it's taking money away from hockey programs 
10 They wanted the IOC to pay for insurance and travel costs for their players, that got rejected. Then they wanted to be named a partner/sponsor for the Olympics, that got rejected. Then they wanted something involving the rights to use highlights from the Olympics in promotional materials, that also got rejected. The NHL owners were dicks by playing hardball, but the IOC offered absolutely nothing in return for interrupting their league and providing the best players for one of the bigger events. I know it's supposed to be about the purity of sport and all that, but the difference in the value of the broadcast rights in Canada alone from NHLers attending would have covered the NHL's demands several times over. Just take it out of the IOC bribe allotment and it would have been fine... That said, the NHL owners were probably still the bigger dicks, because they tried using the promise of attending the Olympics as a bargaining chip for the renegotiation of the CBA with the players. 
25 It was always about the money. They don't care about injuries or interruptions to the season because of morality, just money.
2 The biggest cost is that the IOC refused to pay for insurance for the players anymore. NHL contracts aren't insured for players in tournaments not covered by the NHL, but previously the IOC paid for insurance on player contracts in case of injury. The IOC refused to do so anymore, and that's suddenly more than $30 million that the NHL has to pay extra.
2 >  Guys I didn't say that there was anything wrong with it being about money. Just pointing it out. Please stop explaining things to me like you're my financial advisers. Thanks.Wait, aren't you aware, this is Reddit. Everyone likes to assume you are stupid. /s
3 Put yourself in the position of NHL team owners. You pay your players millions of dollars to play the game and count on them to fill your multi-million dollar arenas and generate interest in your multi billion dollar TV contracts. Now the IOC comes along and wants you to stop your season in the middle for 2 weeks so the star players can all fly across the world to compete in a tournament where they can and do get injured. You also lose all the TV revenue during that period and risk the health of your players for little to no return. So the NHL asked the IOC for some compensation for this (since hockey is BY FAR the biggest revenue generator for the olympics) to cover insurance, lost TV revenue, etc. It really isn't a big ask to want something in return here. The IOC is just as greedy as the owners, with added corruption. 
1 The Olympics itself is all about money. It's not a non-profit event or something 
1 Of course it is a business. The NHL pays for the players travel, covers the insurance, and shuts the league down for 2 weeks. In return the NHL gets nothing. They can't say this awesome Team Canada is made up of players from the NHL, they can't advertise the league, they can't even use footage of their own product they paid for to be there. They get shit all out of the deal and the IOC gets everything. People immediately blame the NHL but more blame is to be put on the IOC. 
-4 Good thing US athletes never use doping or this might look suspicious in more than one way.
30 > The NHL is also hoping the World Cup of Hockey will fill the Olympics role for professional players.That's another good point.  Some would suggest that the creation of the World Cup of Hockey made the NHL less inclined to participate in the Olympics.  Although certainly many fans would much rather have the Olympics over the World Cup of Hockey - or better yet, have both.
3 Additionally, lots of fans are skeptical of the WCOH because:(a) it happens right before the NHL season and thus feels like a glorified preseason game(b) it's a shameless and transparent attempt to replace the Olympics and the IIHF World Championship(c) it has gimmick teams like "North Americans Under 23" and "Miscellaneous Europeans"(d) it has little-to-no participation from other leagues
1 Not true about Canada always winning. USA, Sweden, Russia etc are always competing. World juniors is always exciting. Especially watch out since Canada isn't sending their best this olympics, I doubt they win.  
2 >But these tournaments are useless because Canada is just going to win no matter what level players are goingRugby League World Cup is still good craic and that's basically a tournament to see which out of England and NZ is gonna lose to the Aussies in the final.
1 > World Cup of Hockeywhoa this exists??
1 Canada was going to win the Olympics too. 2014 was the most dominant hockey I've ever seen a team play, not once did it feel like they were being challenged.
0 >But these tournaments are useless because Canada is just going to win no matter what level players are goingLike how the US always wins the world series
6 Yep.  Although the NHL has had a string of Olympics in a row that they did participate in, they haven't been committing to it long-term.  Each time we move towards the Olympics, we have to go through the whole "will they, won't they" song and dance again (although some Olympics are easier to guess than others), but the difference is this time they decided that they won't.
3 I've actually heard some people suggest that.  It wouldn't make a ton of sense thematically.  Basketball is played on a court so it really isn't season specific, but hockey is played on ice so while you can technically play it year-round indoors, it just seems better to play it during the winter.  Even still, a Summer Olympic tournament would make things easier on the NHL and other hockey leagues given that it doesn't disrupt their season.
5 They weren't going to stand in the way of Ovechkin participating, which raised the question of, "If Ovechkin is allowed to participate, then can't other players on the team demand the same courtesy?"  However, it became moot because NHL players simply aren't allowed to participate in the Olympics following the NHL's decision.  So even if the Capitals gave Ovechkin permission to participate and Russia wasn't banned, Ovechkin would still be barred from participating.That part was revealed just before the season and Ovechkin said basically that he was disappointed, but accepting of the situation.
3 There isn't a higher risk, but if a player is injured in a normal game there is insurance to cover it, plus that's just a risk of the game. If a player is injured during the Olympics their normal team gets no compensation, and if it's a popular player you possibly loose revenue from people deciding to not go to game if Big Name Player won't be there anyway.Plus if they need Talented Star to make a playoff push and Talented Star is out for the season because he broke his leg in the Olympics your team is screwed.
1 It definitely felt like Olympic fatigue was a real issue and that impacted the NHL season.  I still loved seeing the NHL in the Olympics and I wish they were participating, but there were consequences there for the league.
1 There certainly could be some interesting stories behind the players on Team Canada/Team USA.  Just as an aside, many minor leaguers aren't eligible to participate in the Olympics because they're signed to two-way contracts (meaning that an NHL team controls them even though they're not playing in the NHL).
1 I bet if computer gaming was an Olympic sport they would have found them some money for transit and lodging....
5 Well yeah...but the league and the players make money from those ventures. And I think it's fair they get some form of compensation. Numerous options were put on the table but the IOC said no to them all. 
3 But they are entitled to the compensation. They pay all the costs for the players to go which is millions of dollars and they get nothing from it. They can't advertise, can't say they're NHL players, can't use the footage, there is no significant growth in viewers otherwise they'd go. A player getting hurt in the NHL or the World Cup is participating in making the league money and it is also there job to be in the NHL. The Olympics isn't their job.It is no different if you bought a new car but you couldn't drive it, couldn't take it off the lot, couldn't tell anyone about it, but the salesman gets to drive it then crash it then say "sucks to be you" and walks away. Then you have to pay to fix it. Tell me how that is fair? 
1 Well for the all-star they’re still playing on the NHL stage so they’re still making money off em. 
2 (their regular season schedule)
1 Oops.  I fixed it, thank you.
1 You mean 2010.
2 > I guess there is no agency that oversees all of hockey the way FIFA oversees all of soccer and the way ITF oversees tennis?Not all of hockey, no.  There is the IIHF, but the NHL isn't a part of it (although the IIHF and NHL do work together) and now the KHL might be withdrawing from it too.
1 Just for clarification though - FIFA has absolutely nothing to do with soccer during the Olympics. Notice how national soccer teams during the olympics don’t use their typical national team logo.
1 > No idea if that was an idle threat or notIt's a ways away still, so we'll have to see.  It's not a given that the NHL will want to go to the China games anyways if the terms of participation are the sames as the ones that were presented to them for Korea, though I do think that all else being equal, the NHL is more inclined to participate in China than it was for South Korea.
1 It definitely sucks for the fans.  Watching Olympic hockey has been a highlight of mine.  That said, I understand where the NHL is coming from even if I don't like there decision from my own wants.  It might be corporate greed influencing things, but the NHL is a business and businesses are inherently going to act based on greed.  There have been times when the NHL felt it made business sense to participate in the Olympics, but this time was different.
1 It sucks to be sure, but at the same time, the NHL is a business and thus governed by money.  They aren't in it for national pride.
1 NHL players are forbidden from participating in the Olympics.
1 The Olympics have been a disruption before of course, but the NHL has ultimately gone despite that.  This time they decided that it's not worth it and that's one of the cons that they had to weigh.  Also, it's not as simple as it being a couple players per team.  First off, some teams lose more players than others, secondly, in an attempt to maintain the intregity of the regular season (not playing games with missing players), the NHL had in the past shutdown entirely for weeks, so all players and teams were impacted.  The leagur compensated by running a condensed schedule, which meant less days off and no All-Star weekend.Additionally, some players that participate in the Olympics suffer afterwards due to fatigue from the high stakes games and the travel (adjusting to a radically different timezone, which is one of the reasons the Canadian Winter Olympics were easier for the NHL to rationalize as that's one less negative for them to weigh in their decision).
1 Just to specify, it's the NHL that pulled out.  The NHL players can't participate because of the league's decision.  So I don't think it's fair to put the blame here on the players themselves.
1 The NHL wanted compensation.  The players were willing to participate, but now they can't.
9 Their contracts are not for the Olympics, and as such, those injuries pose a greater risk to the NHL. It is business, not personal.
7 The same exact injuries, just in a different league. Makes sense
2 Getting injured within the job they are paid to do by the league <> getting **injured** in a "bonus" tournament with little bearing on the NHL's economics.I don't know much about hockey but TV ratings would absolutely take a hit if major stars went down since casual fans would tune out.
2 It's kind of like how they pull the big stars out of games when it's already won. There's just no reason to have your big stars play extra time and risk normal injuries that happen every game, when it's not going to give you anything in return.
1 None, but for one they get Dollars, for the other, not so much.
1 Similar to the criticism of Thursday Night Football I imagine. More frequent games, less recovery, and a bigger chance of snapping your shit up, and they aren't being compensated for it.
1 The difference is that when they're exposed to injuries during NHL games, then at least it's a byproduct of their season.  If they get hurt in the Olympics and that hurts the team's shot at making some of that playoff revenue, then that feels a lot worse for the owners and ultimately it's the owners that have to be convinced to let the players go.  So while, yes, they are exposed to injuries either way, that doesn't mean that the owners consider both scenarios equal.
0 That's not the point. NHL players are theoretically compensated for potential injury. Olympians are not.
2 > Asia is one of the markets they really want to bring hockey to.I think that's a somewhat imprecise way of looking at it.  They're looking at China specifically rather than Asia as a whole, which is why there were games in China.  I'm sure all things being equal they would like to see hockey take off in South Korea too, but it doesn't appear to be a focus the same way China is.
3 It's only been done three times though.  It might just take time for people to start caring about a tournament.  
4 What is it and why does it blow?
5 What? I am an avid nhl fan and I loved the WCOH. It was so much better than the olympics tbh 
2 You're
1 I liked it, I just don't like it at the expense of Olympic hockey. 
-4 go home 
1 Don't tell the president....
10 Wrong on the first point. The NHL obviously wants to have the premiere international tournament. https://www.nhl.com/news/world-cup-of-hockey-will-be-held-in-2020/c-279304374
5 Likewise, MLB does not send its players to the Summer Olympics.The NBA season is on hiatus during the Summer Olympics, so it's less of an issue there.
4 What do the players want to do?
3 They’ve done it before with no problems, even made TJ Oshie an American hero, I haven’t heard a single hockey fan say it’s the right move everyone wants to watch the best players in the world compete for their countries. The NHL isn’t going to fold because they stall the season for 3 weeks, if anything they’ll get more views later on in the season because of a player making a difference in the Olympics, like Oshie
1 >If you owned assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, something tells me you wouldn't ship those assets across the planet, for *somebody else* to make a shitload of money off of, none of which you will ever see.How much money do you think the NHL will see when the NHLPA wants Olympic participation in the new CBA and there's another lockout? You can bet that's going to be a talking point because there isn't a single player in the league who wants to sit this out and is happy with this decision.
1 >the NHL can't commercialize or profit off anythingOnly if you're shortsighted. Olympic hockey draws ratings 10 times higher than NHL games, and should act as a huge advertisement for the sport. After last Olympics, ratings were way up.
3 Nope. They are under contract with their NHL teams. 
21 Does the IOC do that for literally any other competitor though? I've never heard of anyone even proposing this before the NHL did.EDIT: Has the NHL always had this arrangement? I was under the impression it was new.EDIT 2: To be clear I'm aware that both groups are money grubbing ass holes, I was just trying to figure out what the landscape is that all of this has been happening in. Seems like soccer does something like this but it's handled by FIFA instead of the IOC, and that baseball and American football don't have to worry since they aren't olympic sports. Hockey appears to be in a semi-unique situation with regard to having high-value professional players that receive no compensation / insurance / benefits outside of national pride in exchange for the risk they take by playing. I now have a better grasp on why the NHL owners wanted to come to an arrangement and why the IOC doesn't want to set a potentially expensive precedent that could blow over into other sports / competitions.If I'm missing something here please feel free to contribute. Thanks to everyone who replied to explain things.
3 IIHF offered to pay for the insurance, the NHL made more demands from the IOC not granted to any other professional league. NHL is definitely being greedy here.
3 Hockey is a sport first and foremost. 
1 >Hockey is a business first and foremost.Maybe to you.
1 Hockey is a sport first and foremos.
1 Thats because in comparison to the other athletes NHL players claims are 10x because the Olympics aren't their main competition.Crosby being injured has a larger opportunity cost than a speed skater who wasn't going to compete for another year anyway.
-4 >Hockey is a business first and foremost.Only Americans could say stupid shit like this. It's a competitive sport. Treat it like that. Players are competitors and the Olympics are one of the greatest thing a competitor could participate in. But i see Americans want to view Sports as something else. 
3 Right, of the IOC was not a huge dollar grab it would be different. The olympics is just everyone coming together to grab as much as you can get away with. The first Olympian to turn away all of their corporate sponsorships and post games deals will be the first Olmpian to do so.
1 If everyone can risk harming their star players doesn't it just level the playing field?
7 Two things can be true.
37 They can both be?  The IOC being greedy does not prevent the NHL from being greedy and trying to hang on to their own profits
3 You aren't turning over any of your profits to the IOC. So yes, you are greedy.
-1 The NHL could have just taken a break in the middle of the season and extend the end of the season later to make up for the money. 
1 Making it to the olympics really isn't a big deal for hockey players like it is for other sports. And if some players really do want to play in the olympics they can join a different league can't they? 
1 You are correct, however there is a vast gulf between earning a living and being greedy.
2 No, the players wants to play but the owners refuse to let them play.https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-will-not-participate-in-2018-winter-olympics/c-288385598"Chief among them was the 17-day break in the schedule required in February, a time when the National Football League's season has ended and Major League Baseball's season has yet to begin.""The IOC (International Olympic Committee) had been paying for the League's participation costs associated with travel, insurance and accommodations for the players and their guests, but told the NHL it will not continue to pay for those costs for the 2018 tournament."
5 Minimum NHL contract is $650,000
2 This is just false. The minimum NHL salary is $650,000. Average is I believe somewhere in the 3 million range, and you still have some players making 12-13 million per season.
1 Who's salty in this? The players or owners? I meant the owners are losing money not the players. The players actually wants to play in the Olympics.
1 Yes, they can go, but many of them decide not to (or they are forced not to).
1 It'd be Marchand-Crosby-Bergeron like it was in the WCoH. Canada would get to cheer on the rat again!
1 If you want Stamkos to stay healthy you don't let him even think of playing for Canada.
1 Well they're all centermen so they likely each would've had their own line...
10 There are still places to fill the team.  They could turn to players in the other European leagues (Switzerland, Finland, etc), players on AHL-only contracts (as opposed to AHL players on two-way contracts, which aren't eligible), and non-pro players in the junior leagues.
8 Look outside.
3 There is so much unsigned talent in canada. I don't think they'll have any issues filling a team.
2 Grab anyone off the street.  More people play hockey in Mississauga (a suburb of Toronto) than play in all of Austria.Here is a country comparison:https://www.statista.com/statistics/282349/number-of-registered-ice-hockey-by-country/
1 It will go back to the way it was before 1998, when it was Junior Hockey or University players (players in their late teens-early twenties). It's still really good hockey (albeit not the same) and would be kind of like the equivalent of having the best NCAA basketball players play in the Olympics. 
1 It's not quite the same.  To be fair, we've only had one tournament since it's revival, but I can't say I liked the Team Europe/Team North America idea.  Yes, it led to more competitive games and honestly Team North America was interesting, but I felt it also kind of went against the whole nation versus nation aspect of it.
4 Isn't opening up teams to liability of player injury the same with all sports though? Or was it only hockey and not basketball?
1 Short answer: Money.Long answer: MMMMMMMMMoooooooooonnnnnnnneeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyy.
74 The Olympics probably cost the Senators a Cup - Hasek got injured in the year they had far and away the best team in the league.
7 > Owners don't want their star players potentially injured playing hockey for their country.If that was true they wouldnt have tried to jam the World Cup of Hockey down our throats. And a few players did get hurt playing in that.
4 More like they just don't want to take that risk without being compensated for it. 
2 Wow, if football (soccer) clubs thought like that, and didn't allow their players to participate in the world cup or other international tournaments, all hell would break lose. I don't even think that would be legal
1 It's part of the reason. It sounds a lot better to say that, than to say it is because of money, which is by far the bigger reason.
1 Yep. Tavares got pretty badly hurt in the Olympics iirc.
13 to be fair, the whole Olympics thing is about $$$ for IOC and the Olympics committees of different countries too . 
1 That's over simplistic 
2 WHAT ABOUT THE WORLD CUP OF HOCKEY.
0 From an owners perspective I get it, but why wouldn't American players want to win an international competition for their country? I know for most football players, winning the world cup is more important than anything else.
4 It didn't actually shorten the season at all. The big issue is the IOC getting all the benefit from having these stars at the Olympics and the NHL was not allowed to use any pictures, video or anything of their players at the Olympics at all.The NHL assumes 100% of the risk and doesn't see a single dime when the IOC makes away like bandits.
74 It’ll be like soccer in the olympics. The major difference is soccer has the World Cup.
2 In other sports sure, not hockey. No one who plays hockey trains non-stop for 4 years just to be able to make it there.
1 Umm, I'm pretty sure we get dozens of "I worked my ass off to be able to be here. It was hard working a shitty part time job so I could spend the time training," stories every Olympics. 
1 Everyone who plays hockey in the olympics will have been training non-stop. 
3 That’s because Canada Needs the win the Winter Olympics are all they have as a true world power.
1 That's disappointing to hear. I was just thinking that this might still make for some great hockey because I assume we'd just see a lot more junior league players step up, to which Canada has many aspiring. I mean don't get me wrong most hockey is great hockey anyways; I am Canadian after all!. 
1 Well shit! That's diss appointing 
3 ehhhhh....
1 anyone saying Olympic hockey needs pros for excitement has never watched the IIHF World Junior Championships
1 Implying anyone not in the NHL isnt good at hockey?
0 College hockey is unwatchable, amirite?
2 Oh rly, what's your favourite sport if I may ask?
1 The miracle team were not the best players in the world..
4 Every four years I get a migraine. God I hate curling. Such a racket. I'd rather listen to Japanese porn.
1 Last I heard Jamaica hasn't qualified for bobsleigh.  Nigeria however, has already qualified.
61 > All the best players from Finland and Sweden play in the NHL or KHL as well.True, but Finland and Sweden still have their own, relatively strong hockey leagues to pull talent from.  With the NHL (including minor league players tethered to an NHL club) and now likely KHL not participating, Canada and the States' options are much more limited.  It might be that Canada actually looks to the junior leagues for players at this point while the States might dip into the college system.
1 > People keep saying that but they also keep forgetting that many of the top performers in the KHL and other leagues are CanadianThat's not the case.  Like if you look at the Finnish, Swedish, and Swiss leagues, you'll only find two Canadians in the top-10 of scoring over those three leagues.  The Swedish league's leaderboard is dominated by Swedish players (two American, eight Swedish), and the Finnish league's leadboard is dominated by Finnish players (nine Finnish, one French).  Only the Swiss league's leaderboard is diverse and that's where you'll find two Canadians in the top-10.As for the KHL, it's mostly Russians in the top-10, with one Canadian on the list.  But of course that will be moot if the KHL does go through with their threat of pulling out of the Olympics.
1 I would argue that national pride in your participating athletes is the entire point of the Olympics, regardless of their source.  The World Cup of Hockey is the current venue for the national level all star game and is NHL sanctioned."Miracle on Ice" was played without NHL athletes so passionate athletes can produce compelling and memorable matches without being "the best".
1 crosby is damaged goods.  just think of how excited these new guys will be to play for canada.
2 Yeah true, but I am very excited for that game!
1 US-Canada in Women's is secretly the most competitive event at the entire Winter Olympics. Even the pre-Olympics exhibition games have been feisty so far.
1 no, it really wasn't.the competition was between Canada, US, Russia and Sweden for who was in the gold medal, and who was playing bronze every year.every other team was just a pushover and got steamrolled.Russia is gone, and Canada and the US are brought down to using players from the same level as other countries. it will be a slower game, but the teams will be on a more even playing field.
1 Switzerland, Finland, and Sweden have fairly competitive teams, but it's true that they usually can't stand up to the US or Canada.OTOH, those US vs. Canada women's games are some of the most entertaining and competitive hockey, period.
2 > Is this decision popular with the players?Not at all.  For the most part, the players love participating in the Olympics and were unhappy with the NHL's decision.
4039 I mean, if you watched Sochi, you kind of did.
109 I want an Olympic event where all competitors are allowed to do anything for an edge. That would be *very* interesting.
67 It’s called “The Olympics”
122 that actually sounds pretty sick

3 There was a comedian who suggested it once but I forget who, but it's something I'd watch too.Make a new super Olympics where doping is allowed to see what limits could be reached past what is possible without the aid of doping.The regular Olympics would provide the baseline.I get the feeling that it would be like playing the old Olympics games back on the ps1 using your preferred tool to mash the buttons.
1 When Deus Ex style bionics become more common I hope there's something like the Transhuman Olympics 
2 [Here ya go!](http://eachvideo.com/watch?v=jAdG-iTilWU)

1 Welcome to the 2018 Winter Olympics - Enhanced!
1 Polonium and steroids sounds like a good way to create a superhero
2 Fuck yeah we would, Winter just got interesting
1 You are already currently watching it
1 [The All-Drug Olympics.](https://view.yahoo.com/show/saturday-night-live/clip/4973328/weekend-update-all-drug-olympics)
1 Then I think you might like this video:[Eddie Izzard on the Stoned Olympics](https://youtu.be/2x-rUyj2Suo) 🤣🤣🤣
1 You already have. It's called every Olympics and pro sporting event of the past 30 years.
1 You already do. Everyone is on PEDs. Yes, everyone.
1 [SNL](https://view.yahoo.com/show/saturday-night-live/clip/50031179/update-all-drug-olympics) got you started back in the day!
1 XMen Olympics!
3 I imagine a line of Russian athletes filing past a doctor in a lab coat, as he's checking his charts as each athlete comes up, and giving them the appropriate pills in one hand, and a little paper cup of vodka in the other.
1 Gin and tonics all around
7 I think we're trying to draw the line somewhere between "I'm so sick of spaghetti" and "I miss my nuts."
3 You can do all of that on your own, but you cannot generate more testosterone or whatever on your own.
2 We are already seeing it with the Olympics today. Everyone is doping.
1 >the Kremlimpics.Not going to lie, seeing as how the events would all be "Russian" (e.g. bear-vaulting or something), I'd probably watch that.
30 The American won the all around individual at the 84 olympic games. There isn't actually an asterisk next to it. The OP is implying that the Friendship Games had a higher level of competetion. Had everyone competed as normal at the 84 Olympics the American probably wouldn't have even medaled.
8 I think he may have confused some folks with this.  American Mary Lou Rhetton won the all around gold medal in Gymnastics in 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympics.  He is saying that if you compare video footage of Soviet gymnasts at the Friendship Games, they are clearly better than Mary Lou Rhetton.
2 I think he meant that the American won gold at the Olympics, but the competition at the Friendship games showed much greater skill.
3 Americans won at the Olympics because the Russians weren't there. Footage from the Friendship Games (still a big event) shows the Russians would have won if they were actually at the Olympics.
2 American won the gold medal. After viewing footage from Friendship games, it is clear the Soviets would have won.
2 > specifically having trouble with which one was still a big event for gymnasticsThe Friendship Games.I think the reason for the astrix is because their drug testing is a little more lax than for the Olympics.
2 In the 80s the Russians dominated gymnastics.  Like dominated.  All the Soviet bloc countries were so far ahead of the west. And a key reason the west even had any gymnastics ability is because of defecting gymnastics people being bought in as coaches. Anyway because of that the best people in the world didn’t show up to the Olympic Games.  The person that won it was the best at the games but no where near the best in the world.  Would be like hosting a table tennis tournament with no asians.  
1 I feel exactly the same way. I hope he returns to explain. 
10 From his comment it seems he means that the Soviet gymnasts were much better although it's a tad unclear.
4 At least back then, Soviet gymnastics were worlds apart from everyone else. There were quite a few events back then that the Soviets were always assumed to win. That was one of them. 
6 Edited her medal after two minutes. 
1 In 1984, the all-round gold medals for women's gymnastics went to Mary Lou Retton in the Olympic Games and to Olga Mostepanova in the Friendship Games. Here's why:event|Retton|Mostepanova:--|:--|:--Balance Beam|[complete video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u1GrrhVdck)|[complete video, half speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TxmxXfcVk)Floor|[complete video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6rIB240g7w)|[partial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVcea7nn8o)Uneven Bars|[complete video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsAO_OvMmOU)|[partial video, half speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKET91mONFw)Vault|[video of both attempts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sya66z4mCiA)|[video of one attempt, half speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3jhe1ngEqQ)I know very little about gymanstics, so I can't really judge which performance is supposedly better, but I guess this comparison is easier when the video footage in question is linked.
3 Soviets were far better
1 OP will surely deliver.
1 They were trying to say Mary Lou Retton wouldn't have won the all-around gold if the Soviets were there. So fans would put an asterisk next to her name because she wasn't the "true winner" 
1 I've never gotten into it. Would you recommend it? Where should I start, from the beginning? 
1 It seems crazy that they'd spend all this effort to cheat at the Olympics and then just turn around and go 'eh screw it'
5 I dont think so. They used sochi as a powerful geopolitical tool to justify interference in ukraine. Russia is not a country to abandon that kind of advantage.
1 So in 2 years they never bothered to recertify their program?  That means they honestly didn't want to compete this cycle. What did they tell their athletes? This is shirty. I wonder what the endgame plan could possibly be. 
-8 You live in Russia? How does it feel to be the only developed country that's more of a shit show than the US?Edit: I'm sorry to have offended. I love Russia. I learned some Russian in high school. But I will likely never go there because of their corruption and persecution of queer people. Nyet!The US is sliding into some really dark water and I'm embarrassed for my country. 
1 True, but Russia likes China a tad more. 
1 Opposition parties are categorically surpressed in russia yes...but Putin is still insanely popular. Playing field may not be level but the polls themselves are considered to be fair or close to it.
1 Trump will show up on his behalf, compete in nothing and then claim the IOC awarded him all of the best gold medals that were ever awarded. When the press reports otherwise he will compose 6 progressively more unhinged tweets about the lying fake news media, and then take a dump on a picture of President Obama.
1 "*Dis is what you get when you want to make fuck with Russia, biotches!*"
38 No, no it's not a different question...it's all the same, the guy is morally bankrupt and has done everything possible to ensure his continued rule of Russia, even going as far as changing the Russian Constitution to suit his needs.
11 >As for elections Putin won last elections, and will win next elections.That's the most personified Russian phrase I've ever read.
1 > presidential elections showed almost noneBullshit.>You can argue that game rigged before election by using administrative resource and removing all of real opposition from being able to run, but that is a different question.No, it's not a different question, it's the same question. There are no elections in Russia. 
1 > presidential elections showed almost none.Blatantly false. Putin’s last election had the same weird lob-sides distribution of votes, same weird peaks at values divisible by five, etc. 
1 Signed, u/_loyalist 👏
1 Oh u knew that the wpk won its last elections too?
1 Hello, 55 Savushkina Street!
1 That approval rating doesn’t mean shit. Most Russians assume the poll answer might impact them negatively this way or another, so they say what they think pollster wants to hear. “Sure, I LOVE our dear beloved president!”. And then if the government changes, the very same people will spit on his grave and say how they always knew he was a no-good western spy. Just look how the perception of Soviet leaders changed in XX century when they left power. 
1 >under Putin they have had more personal freedom than other Russian people before themUnless you happen to be queer.
1 People seems to forget this fact. I know quite a few Russians who, while not particularly political, like Putin. Trying to get their perspective from the understanding I get in the US (I am fascinated by Russia) and the short story is before Putin there was no food and gangs ran rampant. Today there is food and its much safer. Makes sense given the turmoil some of the generation that saw the fall of communism went through. 
2 Of course not. If it was in any way critical amount, I.O.C. wouldn't dare to ban Russia. It is manageable expense, which they will try to correct with fine they imposed on R.O.C. Though, I doubt they'll receive that money anytime soon, if ever.Doesn't change the fact, that it is reasonable and logical reaction. And Russians wouldn't watch current Olympics anyway.
37 The man risked his life to expose the truth, and willingly accepted a life of exile as a result.  Courage is the only word that comes to mind.
1 He was in a tough position. If you look into it, his mother used to help him dope as a high school athlete, and either his mother or sister IIRC doped as well. He was kinda initially pushed into it, then sent to the mental institute and then even more forced into it. But at some point, since he's doing doping and anti doping, he's kind supporting cheating? But then he reads 1984 so much and talks about doublespeak etc . . 
1 They are and were it not for that doc and Rodenchenko's testimony they would have shrugged this off too and bowed to Putin's every demand but this tim the evidence was so public, the crime so audacious they had no choice or they would have looked like puppets. Basically Russia cheated so hard and so flagrently they left no margin for interpretation. 
151 Yeah, that's what I'm going to do with my extra time, too....... *unzip*
2 Nope. You spent it all typing this comment.
4 By changing only 8-10 words in your comment, this can all apply to the United States. Sad.
4 Yes.
6 Now that 20 free seconds is wasted. No continuity /s
1 definitely worth a listen. that was a great episode. its episode 1019 and the guys name is Bryan Fogel if anyone is interested.
1 It was so good!
1 This describes exactly what I've been feeling. 
4 Yeah, mostly at the beginning IIRC. It starts out as a less serious doc about the director trying to dope himself and then stumbles into this whole thing with Rodchenkov. There are a bunch of scenes of him injecting himself/blood and some language. That's all that could be objectionable, I think.
1 Yea I think swearing is the only thing in the movie that gave it the MA rating.
1 Probably also because it shows drug use. They show him injecting himself throughout the beginning sections. Also collecting pee samples and stuff like that maybe? Rating rules are weird.
1 Name of 'Motel Docu' please. For science etc.
3 *spoilers*Didn't they show the doped up race toward the middle or end? If I recall there was a mechanical malfunction...
81 They definitely do. Russia's concern is the image *within* Russia, they couldn't care less what other parts of the world think of them. Russia's government is rampant with corruption and greed but they are extremely successful because of propaganda, nationalism, and fear. They without a doubt have an image and a reputation to uphold, which they do extremely well. It's just that their image is focused on their own citizens, not on what other countries think of them.
93 "Why does the rest of the world not like or trust us? What's wrong with everyone else?"
11 Or maybe the assassinations are to scare others away from whistleblowing? 
6 Maybe they like being viewed as a collection of assholes.
89 Just look at this comment thread. People are deflecting to how the USA's incarceration is on the same moral level as Russian assassinations. 
1 > Everyone out to be on the look out for bots and Russian cyberinfluencers about ~~this~~ every story involving Russia, and then some. :/
1 Found a commie troll!
1 Hallelujah 
1 But Michigan gigantic galactic tumble field in a buzzards minefield of change 16 years. So in Russia everything commie, baby want fuk?
2 This is no regular_Fuckface, mind you.  Behold!  /u/King_Fuckface!
467 That's because there is no program.  All the witnesses are immediately incinerated. 
95 Well, we wouldn't know, right?
10 >Just so everyone knows, despite the numerous cop shows and movies, the Witness Protection Program has never failed, ever.With a minor cavet, that as long as the protected people followed the program and didn't out themselves. 
16 Never failed to keep the witnesses deaths hidden. 
10 Tell us more!
3 How would we know if it does fail?
3 I thought it had failed but because the witness themselves have fucked up not the program.
3 Well the guy from Goodfellas, Henry Hill, would routinely show up on the Howard Stern show. He didn't really need it after some time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3G8-fQfFCwPS: He's an idiot of a human being.
3 What do they mean by that? That no one's ever been discovered? Or no one's ever been killed as a result?
3 Not entirely true... [People Die](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/WITNESS-TO-GANG-SLAYING-SHOT-DEAD-IN-S-F-SHOP-2497747.php) in witness protection, but it's not like in the movies at all.
1 Per [US Marshall website](https://www.usmarshals.gov/witsec/):> No Witness Security Program participant, following program guidelines, has been harmed or killed while under the active protection of the U.S. Marshals Service.Loophole, part of the program guidelines are to *avoid being harmed or killed*.  
2 Challenge accepted.
1 How would you know that unless that it has failed? 
1 I mean that we know of lol
1 Really? That's actually super interesting. Good job Witness Protection guys!
1 I don't suppose we'll ever see a documentary about that, ever.
1 that's because real witness protection is boring, no one would want to watch a movie with someone living in witness protection and living a normal life lol
1 How would we know?
1 And I hope the record stays clean.  But I don't think the program has ever gone up against an entire country's intelligence services (Russia).  I hope Grigory stays safe and sound though.  This guy was and is so damning to Russia they will stop at nothing to capture him alive and being him back to Russia for torture.  Putin' him in his place...  (I'll be here all week). 
1 But how would we know?
1 Wait for real?
1 They like to put a giant caveat in there though. They say that no one that has followed their instructions has been found and killed. Plenty of people have gone into Witness Protection, contacted some people they know but weren't supposed to talk to and ended up dead. 
-1 Hopefully they maintain that record with a russian puppet in the whitehouse.
-1 The Equifax leak can change it.
-2 I still wish him good luck. The Russians have their own FSB agent occupying the White House. I wouldn't bet on the integrity of the program at this point. 
3 That's a good question. I've wondered that as well. I could see them using the public to their advantage by spreading disinformation. For example, perhaps they moved him out of the country but claim he is being protected on U.S. soil.Or they paid for his plastic surgery. I honestly have no idea. 
1 Interesting. I had no idea. Thanks for the information; it led me down a Russian-government Wikipedia rabbit hole. 
1 And his dog.
1 I'm just waiting for the tweet storm in which he will defend the Russian Olympic Committee. 
61 Putin is popular in Russia. Like here in the US, the people there are feeble-minded and easily given to propaganda and constant, easy to spot lying. 
14 Yeah, I'm sure this will happen. Putin is HATED over there, right? There's no way he's wildly popular.Right?Riiiiiiight?
5 Of course we will, just been waiting for a blessing from Americans on reddit all this time to do it. 
3 If it weren't for those nukes, Russia would be full of freedom right now. 
1 Good joke lol
-1 Hahahaha
1 In fact he was a criminal. He sold doping to athletes and he was known for this. I dunno how he landed in RUSADA in a first place. At the same time i don't consider him traitor, but i'm also not sure in his sincerity. As far as i know he said that US pays him and they bought him a car and a house and etc. And it's not like US can't pay him money to fuck up Russia for Syria or anywhere else to make us even more "demons".
10 I think those journalist all committed suicide. With 2 shots to the back of the head. 
11 Ah yes, the last high profile American whistleblower is sitting safely at home.. oh wait, no, he ran to Russia.
-4 Right because the humane thing to do is throw them into solitary confinement without legal counsel 
-1 Well the USA is known for doing that also - they either kill or put your behind bars forever. EDIT: So I guess whistleblowers like John Clifford Baxter, Ted Stevens, Pat Tillman, Michael Ruppert, Gary Webb or other Americans just killed themselves or died to "accidents". I bet you if Snowden had been in the states he would also been found dead. 
-2 They do, they just hide it. Russia on the other hand flaunts it to discourage future occurences.
-3 America is far from the wholesome good guy many of it's citizens think it is. 
-3 No your right instead we just waterboard them and lock them up for life. Whistleblowers of foreign countries are they only ones who get a fair shake. Look at Snowden in Russia or this guy here.
12 Witness Protection Program. Necessary I believe, since two directors of RUSADA (russian anti-doping agency) have died under mysterious circumstances.
1 Witless Protection Agency
1 Welp, Piss & Poop
1 Witness protection program. 
1 witness protection programme
-1 Witness Protection Program maybe?
-1 The Witness Protection Program
-1 Witness Protection Program.
0 Witness Protection Program
-2 Witness Protection Program
-1 Witness protection program
15 Maybe not. Americans distrust their government a lot more than Russians (especially now) and people like Snowden were supported by a large number (especially on Reddit)
10 I think the average Russian is pro-Russian, but that doesn't extend to the creepy, corrupt, and dangerous illegal doping ring. There's a difference between liking your home country, and liking corruption. 
6 I'm pro America in the same sense that a parent is pro their kid.  They want their kid to have great opportunities and won't let other people fuck with their kid but at the same time they make sure they aren't fucking up and doing the wrong thing.  It is kind of funny how nationalists don't understand the latter half of this very easy concept.  The nationalists are more like that mom that thinks their kid can't do anything wrong.
97 She is an extremely kind, humble and loving person. So, I just ignore it for now and hopes she comes around one day. It's not important enough to ruin our relationship. 
1 Russians are weird like that. When I was in high school I went tglo a Governors Honor Academy thing . One if the classes was Russian and the lady that taught it was a very smart, sweet woman. But she also said all the Chechens shoukd be killed, this was not long after the theater hostages were killed,...so they can be nice but have strong feelings
1 Half my relatives listen to Limbaugh and Hannity.  They are that delusional.
1 I guess you could call it a red flag.
1 The American propaganda machine is hardly different.  You've likely lived with or been around someone often who believes these things but swapping America and Russia.
23 Trump is a stupid version of Putin. Putin knows how to talk and manipulate without stepping on toes. Smooth as fucking butter. Real professional Bond villain. Intelligent as all hell. Trump is a clown in comparison, but just as bad.
1 The frustrating thing is that Russians, T_D, etc all think WE'RE the ones that are indoctrinated. By WHO? We don't have any representation!If you're not sure if you're the one who is indoctrinated, just look at what you know to be true. Is all of the information you trust basically controlled by a single person, AKA state-run media? Does everyone else in the world seem to disagree with it, as in MULTIPLE other countries? If so, question your source.
18 The US wouldn't pretend that troops aren't there. The US would just point to one of any number of treaties that allows US troops to be there, most of which date from the Cold War.Besides, the US doesn't have a propaganda machine. The traditional sources of journalism got hit pretty hard by changing technology which led to a dip in quality. People notice and are unhappy with said dip, but that unhappiness is exploitable. So rather than pointing to the massive layoffs in news rooms and the rise of aggregators that have zero integrity, some people have been excited to add ideological spins on what is at its core a market-based crisis.If Trump created an official mouthpiece that was somehow trusted as an actual reputable news source then there might be something analogous going on.
11 I love how, without fail, whenever North Korea or Russia are brought up, there will always be the pretentious "yeah but what about America??" comment that contributes nothing and is completely irrelevant to the the discussion.
2 Only for about half the country. Who, *coincidentally*, all happen to be in the same political party.

2 That’s the real competition taking place. Can’t catch me (taking PEDs)!
1 Yes it is.
175 They would probably just compete as Independent Olympians with the Olympic logo as their flag. It's been done many times before already including in the most recent 2016 games. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Olympians_at_the_Olympic_Games

1 > I'd really like to know what a neutral uniform looks like. Solid grey?[Quite the contrary](https://i.imgur.com/tMVizsu.jpg)
245 Each has to prove they are individually clean.
12 You're not wrong.
2 > Those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. Although it is unknown exactly how many will clear that bar, it is certain that the contingent from Russia will be depleted significantly.
4 I guess in Russia, the medals own you.
2 > And you can be sure everyone will know how many medals "Russia" wins.I mean, unless you're a Russian sports fanboy doing insane mental gymnastics, the answer is Zero. 
1 > but it doesn't actually stop them from competingWithout Putin's blessing, they risk their and their family's lives if they compete.
3 Exactly they're not nationalistic, they're isolationist. There is a big difference.
1 It's an odd situation in that they're nationalistic in that they are fiercely loyal to the government based out of Moscow but many of those tendencies are split between an idealization of modern Russia and of the former Soviet Union, which could explain the lack of a single flag becoming a representation of nationalism. 
1 You probably never were in Russia. I spent there 27 years and it feels much more nationalistic and militaristic than US.
1 they are nationalistic, try watching their state media. 
1 Wrong flag there man
2 It won't be, it's a system that's already working in track and field. It's basically Russian athletes who live and train in another country, for example the USA. They are then under the control of the local doping authority rather than the Russian one. 
0 They will presumably be as clean as everyone else, which is to say basically clean, in the word of the great Chael Sonnen.
9 I think thats fair. I'm sure that there are Russian athletes that have never doped, and as long as they are stringently tested I don't see the problem. This is a huge insult to Russia and i'm glad they did it 
1 I guess the athletes have to be invited
2 The same group that banned Russia, right?
1 Let's see how it plays out.  I am guessing not many will end up participating.
2 Oh, I thought there were just individual people doping themselves
2 oh ok. I didn't know that

12 This. Like a bad episode of "are you afraid of the dark?"
1 What, you didn't like the guy with the big masturbation arm?
1 Right? The whole thing was a cringe-inducing journey of hamfisted symbolism and ego-stroking. M Night himself plays a visionary author whose work will change the world for the better. Yikes. And the whole story centers around a useless dishrag of a damsel-in-distress whose name is literally Story. I was forced to watch this movie with family over the holidays, and still feel a little bitter about being put through that embarrassing mess.
1 No it's not. It is a terrible piece of trash. I can't believe there are people out there that actually like Lady in the Water.

2 yea because we need blizzard to be making political statements on a game like overwatch
11 But where does that kind of thinking stop. If everyone was less proud of their countries because the state isdoing systematically bad things then no one could possibly have any pride in any country at this point. EDIT: I worded this very poorly. I wasn't trying to say that Russians shouldn't be ashamed of the doping. I was trying to say that there is always something to be proud about in the country that you live in and people should still celebrate those things while working on the bad. Those Russians that have always been clean have, IMO, earned the right to represent their country if they wish. 
2 I would care more if I thought there was even a small chance that a good number of the elite level athletes were clean. The Russians aren't even finishing thaaat great with all this doping. It really does suggest that most people are doing it. I know it is not as systematic and as far as we know not at a state level all that but at the end of the day doping is doping. And the Russians were doing the same tests as everyone else. If those tests are adequate this measure isn't necessary as they would be caught regardless. All this is doing is giving other people who are cheating a better shot.
20 Which in all honesty would be very very rare in this case.
1 No individuals can compete as neutrals but a neutral team isn't a guarantee and it's only happened once before in 1992 as the Soviet Union was falling. Clean individuals will be able to compete as neutrals 
3 Yeah they've already hinted at a boycott if the ban was going to happen. This has been a possibility for awhile now, so it's not a giant surprise. But fun fact, the dude who was instrumental in orchestrating the scam in the labs is banned for life from the Olympics, AND is in charge of the 2018 World Cup in Russia! I'm sure that will be 100% above board 
14 Hey! You're admitting that Britain isn't European!
1 The UK leaving the EU fucks the UK more but it also fucks the EU. You don't lose your second (at the time of Brexit) largest economy, your banking hub and your best military/intelligence without it hurting you.And Putin has played a blinder in Syria, keeping those refugees going and funding Front National and AfD.
1 Destabilized America!? Yeah politics have been tense but nothing anyone is shedding blood over. Still have the largest economy and military our place on the globe has only gotten higher since Putin took over Russia.
6 Am I wrong in assuming Europe has been somewhat destabilized by increased immigration the Middle East? There seems to be some cultural clashing leading to increased nationalist activity in parts. I'm not saying Europe isn't stable, but stronger than ever? 
2 Europe not really, he's using any chance to disrupt the EU if it's his work or not. Anti EU political parties and national sentiments are growing, extremists groups, some of which are openly financed from Russia (like Le Pen) are on the rise. The migrant crisis is continuing. EU has the best economic results as a whole but thanks to alternative Russian news shared all around social media we are doing so badly that only choice forward is to drop out of EU and NATO too.China is doing well of course, the regime is not so free to let people criticize too much.
1 He has to have even a semblance of a plan for those regions even though China has the absolute upper hand over Russia, even more than the US.Just wondering what the plans are, keep your eyes peeled...
1 >Europe stronger than ever>Europe, with EU falling apart bit by bit>Europe, with migrants flooding it>Europe, with terrorist attacks weekly in smaller form, at least once a year in bigger formStronger than ever. Diversity is your strength.
1 Europe is not stronger than ever
1 >Europe stronger than everUh, no, no they are not.
5 I'm referring to a net gain since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their current size is irrelevant to what I'm saying, I was speaking as to growth. I believe Russia is probably in a better position now than they would without their shady involvement, since 1992. I'm clearly not saying Russia is stronger than it was before the USSR collapsed. 
2 You're seeing a lot of short term losses, and not realizing that those could be long term gains for Russia. I'm betting that they have a net gain in doing all of this, especially since I'm sure there's plenty that even our government doesn't know about. Crimea? If they manage to keep it, it might not pay off for decades. But eventually, it could very well pay off. Land is generally more valuable than money. E: They're trying to outlast the sanctions. 
2 Yes, shit is hitting the fan for them now, deservedly so. And yes, they're losing plenty. Of course they're not as strong as before the USSR collapsed. But since 1992, I'd bet that they're in a better position now because of their shady tactics, than they would be if they did everything by the books. Who knows how much of their bullshit hasn't come to light, too. 
2 The nukes they have probably help a little too.
2 What's the point of having international influence when you pay for it with the wellbeing of your citizens?
1 [I assume you should look up GDP based on Purchasing Power Parity instead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)
11 Yes, we see a clear growth if Fascism across the globe, US with Trumps rhetoric and complete lack of respect for a free press etc, UK with Brexit and the lies that lead to it, Turkey with Erdogan gaining more and more power and less and less critical voices being heard, Scandinavia with the growth of nationalistic parties with roots in the Nazi-movement etc. etc. etc.We are living in very interesting times and I feel to helpless and anxious about watching fascism spread like this and being totally unable to do anything about it. I don't think things are gonna go as far as they did in the '30s but it is like watching history repeat itself and it is scary as fuck.When I was reading about WW2 etc in school I never thought I was gonna live through anything like it, but here we are.
1 THIS.They definitely believed in the system as it allowed them to grow from relatively modest backgrounds to top positions. Not to mention that all of them up until Gorbachev had witnessed war. I guess that changes your perception of right and wrong
1 As much as I agree with your sentiment the same could be said about any form of government before the rise of globalism.
76 yeah but those were all non-nuclear states
12 Followed by a lasting era of peace right?
2 That usually happens when dictators become so inpopular that the entire country turns against them. Putin is not impopular in Russia. He still enjoys a lot of support, especially among the younger generation who have not experienced the Soviet era.
1 Eh it seems like most russians love putin
1 That's also if their people are tired of their shit. Putin is a God over there. You only need to keep the rich happy and the middle complacent.
25 Also check out the comments in /r/russia on this topic - many Russians actually wholeheartedly believe this. The ban is a great gift to Putin for the upcoming presidential elections. The less people are focused on internal mess and the more on external "enemies", the better.
1 I agree with you completely that this has been happening for a long time (even since the Russian Empire). Still, this narrative has rather recently (maybe starting with the Russo-Georgian war?) become one of the main mechanisms that support Putin's rule in Russia.
1 I like the way Snrub thinks
1 Wait, is this the neighbor Vadim? He's a debil!
1 This is hilarious to picture
6 No fucking way it's Medvedev, he's lost a lot of popularity and it would be asinine to promote him any time soon. Wouldn't be surprised if he gets thrown under the bus or demoted later down the line, perhaps after the re-election. 
1 > a decade ago when that was "the only thing on"Yeah, I can totally picture myself watching the olympics all day if that were the case nowadays, but alas, it's not, so I'd only tune in to watch the specific bits I'm interested in
9 Okay there's such a thing as seeing too big of a picture sometimes bud
7 In the grand scheme of things literally everything is trivial. Humanity as a whole is likely completely irrelevant to the history of the galaxy, unworthy of even a footnote mention when the story is complete. Of course, here on Earth where there are people who actually care about things the Olympics is a huge thing. National reputations are put on the line and it's often a proxy for other conflicts.People still remember the "Blood in the Water" Water Polo match during the 1956 games. It was shortly after the Soviet Union rolled tanks into Hungary to put down a reformist Communist government that was insufficiently loyal to them. The Hungarian national team were in a position to win a medal, they just spent the entire match beating on the Soviet National Team instead of playing the game. The refs just let it happen. It was incredibly cathartic for the Hungarians.
6 Olympians are the peak athletes from each country. Better than anyone else. Nothing is trivial about that.
1 I wasn't talking about anyone in specific. I'm just saying that Putin is an oppressor who does not allow rival politicians to take power, which is a shame considering the things Russia is capable of with better dimplomatic relations. 
1 I doubt russia will need to bend it's knee for the western countries. Hell, even the UK is about to leave the EU because it wants to retain more control. Countries are free to do whatever they want. I wish for a russia that wants to make the world a better and more prospherous place together with the west. Be an ally instead of the dangerous "loner" with their own agenda. Putin is hated because he does the opposite. He undermines western democracies, feeds civil wars, and oppresses people. I am pretty sure Russia's opposition is being crushed. Ive done a quick google search and found 2 oppositionleaders and a whole bunch of journalists being murdered. Russia is a dictatorship, Turkey has gone the same road.
3 My parents did, that's what they are saying.
-1 i never said he wasn't. people are blaming him for Olympiads doping. 
0 Eh that's plausible.I think Putin has destroyed Russia's opportunity to integrate with the international community in a way that would have been more long term beneficial for Russia, it will take a long time for the stain of invasions and state murders to fade. 
2 The USSR was MUCH more of a world power relatively than Russia is today. It's not even a conversation, either you know this or you're straight up delusional.Their relative share of the world economy was greater. Their relative share of world manufacturing was greater. Their expenditure on defense was greater. They supported friendly regimes worldwide to pursue their interests. They competed in the space race against the US. Today what is Russia? In every respect, today's Russia is weaker than the USSR. They're less respected on the world stage. Their military is weaker. Their GDP is the size of fucking Italy. Russia today is only a threat to it's weaker neighbors. You think France or Germany or China really take Russia nearly as seriously as they did in cold war times? The USA especially is almost recklessly lax regarding a nuclear power like Russia compared to before the Soviet collapse. 
1 They had as much geopolitical influence as any nation not named the US.  
1 "define world power">a country that has significant influence in international affairs.Are you in need of basic world history of the last century? There are probably some four minute YouTube videos that would catch you up.
3 Which doesn't really help the original guy's assertion that Putin somehow made Russia a world power. They've had nukes for a while now, before Putin was even born probably. All he's done is help tank their economy by provoking western sanctions. It's pretty sad that a country as historically and culturally relevant as Russia is still living under a dictatorship. The Russian people deserve better than Putin, much better.
2 Some power sure, but they had that before Putin.
1 More of a regional power. Their GDP is lower than that of Italy. 
10 Its military and its scientific achievements and its geopolitical influence made it a superpower. In all of these sectors Putin's Russia is nothing compared to the USSR at its height 
3 The USSR had a fuck ton of massive flaws but it was absolutely a superpower, it was the second biggest economy in the world, the first nation in space, had a truly enormous landmass and global reach, Putin has spent all this time and effort trying to retake 2 or 3% of what they lost when the USSR collapsed.I don't know how young to have to be to think that the USSR wasn't a bigger power, it was in fact one of two superpowers. 
1 I meant Putin has been propping up Assad (the dictator). And no, we do not have to give him credit for anything but being a bastard. Untold thousands would still be alive, millions would still be in their home country if not for Putin's interference. Assad is a brutal dictator who should have been deposed years ago, but instead he's kept right on killing thanks to Putin. 
1 I like how you say all of this as if Russia doesn't spend an unholy amount of time inventing propaganda against Western countries and flat out lying to their citizens and the world. This is the definition of the pot calling the kettle black. You guys really need to  make your social media work more subtle. 
41 It’s sad that I had to actually check his Twitter to make sure this was fake 
4 "I asked Putin repeatedly about this, he assured me he did not meddle with urine samples. You can only ask so many times!"
2 Reads like a MAD LIB.
0 “But why won’t the IOC ban Crooked Hillary?”
26 Crooked investigators (like the ones who won't go after crooked Hillary) bared fine respectable athletes from competing because of accusations of doping, which is FAKE NEWS. Sad!
1 What's the point of the Olympics?How does sending a message to the Russians as a whole accomplish this goal?Are you trying to be fair to the athletes or to the countries? If the answer is being fair to the athletes, then you judge them at an individual level.
16 Examples? Especially an example of a nation doping at the same time as Russia, that was caught but isn't facing the same penalties as Russia is right now? Because vaguely saying "all nations do this because they can" is classic projection and whataboutism. The intent is to shroud reality and make it impossible to discern fact.
13 By saying that, he dilutes the wrong they have done (as it now appears common practice), which can be interpreted as defending (or at least making them seem less bad) Russia whether intentional or not. Especially when considering it's a direct response to a satirical remark about Russia cheating.
11 Whataboutism is a Russian tactic used to muddy the waters in order to dilute wrongdoing. Him bringing up that "all countries cheat" only serves to dilute the fact that Russia has been caught red handed cheating. If other countries are cheating, let them be investigated and caught. Until then, discussing it just does Putin's job for him
9 Whataboutism.
-1 I don't know, but in case you are, I am not a qualified medical professional and might not be able to provide adequate assistance.
11 If I don't survive, tell my wife, hello.
1 He wasn't in power when Germany won the right to host though.
1 And Germany won the bid to host the Olympics in 1931, before the NSDAP came to power.
1 True but running the most powerful country in Europe while saying your country was a superior race that needed to subjugate the rest of Europe is. Europe new Hitler's ideas on rsce and it hurt ties with Italy before and during the war.
1 It wasn’t as big as his expansionist ideas that was the main point I should’ve put it first
2 That's a very limited definition of honor, and one I do not agree with at all.There's false honor, which is thin veneer pasted over true immorality. But that's very different from true honor, and should never be confused for it.
1 Good guy. The best guy
1 No one here is saying that, you're attributing where there is nothing more. ITT people are mad at Putin. If asked, most people will tell you that it is not the Russian people that are the problem. Much like our own country, it's our leaders that have made abhorrent choices. 
1 On the other hand, this is about organised doping in the olympics, not geopolitics.That's what I mean about a chip being on one's shoulder.
1 Sshh, he's going to completely ignore the contents of your post and label you as a Russian shill. 
1 yes because the holocaust was the only bad thing the nazis did and the entire goddamn planet was none-the-wiser to them until *after* world war 2.Are you for real?
1 WITH A CLOTH
1 Ooh rofl ok, no wonder it sounded genuine.Thanks for the info
1 1. I'm simply Russian and go to reddit to read and discuss some news about Russia form western point of view, because you don't speak Russia to read our threads.2. You call trolls everyone doesn't support your point of view? That's why you believe any shit your media feeds you.3. I don't know what is kool-aid, and i don't drink anything, except juice, man. I see the only words you found was not to discuss or disprove by facts, but to work like a tipical wester ommentator. Dam... then I just feel sorry for you.
1 dam straight brah. Dudes on the OJ
8 It doesn't exist, because we don't use government funding to sponsor athletes. Most doping is organized through the shoes companies (most well known is Nike). Pretty convenient excuse for the US to have. I'm sure doping is wide-spread, but it can be pinned on an individual or the company, rather than the entire country. It's pretty fascinating stuff.
4 U.S. just leaves it to the individual. Coaches trainers and doctors are a lot more fragmented in the states
11 So your evidence is based entirely on your own speculation because "well they gotta be"
11 yea chief, get back to us when you have incontrovertible proof that the secret service was aiding in cheating.  Until then you got nothing comparable. 
1 Why do people keep making this claim without a shred of evidence? Prove that America has a systemic doping problem and I'll gladly advocate for their banning as well.
5 Probably not state sponsored though. Though with the way things are going with our current administration nothing would surprise me anymore. 
1 Oh yes of course the shenanigans stopped right?https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-flumenbaum/scandal-of-the-ages-docum_b_118842.html
3 https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/23/wada-china-doping-allegations-xue-yinxianHave a read.
11 Track & Field was banned by the governing body of that sport, not the Olympic Committee.
7 WADA recommended banning Russia and the IOC didn't. Seems pretty weak to me, but it's all subjective.
4 The McLaren report was published before Rio, it's why their Athletics team was banned. The IOC just didn't have the guts to ban Russia weeks before the opening ceremonies.
5 Thank you for the insight into Russian revisionism. Would you like to share your take on the annexation of Crimea in 2014?
1 I don't know if anyone is shaming you, but yeah I guess he shouldn't assume that Russians feel humiliated? I know my Russian friends are downright saying it's not true and just the world punishing Russia for Crimea. 
2 Hold my cherry MX switches, I'm goin in! 
1 It's not that inexplicable, honestly. Putin owns all of Donnie's loans.
9 > huge boner for Vladimir Putin.Yuge. But it only looks yuge because of his tiny hands. 
-20 Yeah, we really should be at war with Russia. 
1 Looks like someone got triggered by my comment. I didn't even support Hillary Clinton in the election.
1 You *seriously* believe Canada for example has a secret state sponsored doping program? Get real dude, take the tin foil hat off.The reason why the Russians did is because they've used the Olympics as a political show of force for decades. Western athletics have more checks and balances in place to prevent that sort of thing. It's why for example Americans mostly led the charge to bust Lance Armstrong, an American himself. 
13 the Russians/Soviets have always been dominant in ice skating - hence why they became coaches for American teamsalso living in a country that's covered in ice for months at a time will just naturally lead to people excelling in that field
2 I haven't heard about dopings enchanting endurance, it's my bad then. I do know about stuff helping with your focus, but I do wonder if they'd be helpful in the long run, since they kinda screw your focus in the long run, if you abuse them much, and I doubt if you can compete for long with those.Endurance, maybe, but artistic ice skating isn't about endurance that much either. Russia has always been good in ballet and figure skating, and they're a huge country as well. I don't think they'd need doping for collecting medals, when their worse competitors can be better than North American champs. 
1 Not to mention, strength is a factor in figure skating as well. You can't tell me it doesn't take a lot of strength to pull off some of those jumps.
0 Every doping lets the body recover faster. That's also how you build more muscles with doping. Figure skating isn't really about the recovery though, if you're not suggesting there are stuff comes on a blood test and allows you to train more and kills the fatigue for good.
1 TIL then. 
1 I was replying to a specific comment and wasn't defending Russians in any way. There's no need to cry.
1 His account was created...........wait for it.........TODAY. 
2 Officials already said that Russian sportsmen aren't going. Maybe some will disobey I am not sure about specifics. But they will have hard time getting money from Russia after that, and probably would emigrate as a result.
8 This is a time of rampant greed.
1 Let's give it a shot. Especially since the Russians and all NHL players are banned. 
0 God forbid we actually make the Winter Olympics interesting. I couldn't care less if athletes want to ruin their bodies with long term doping effects.
10 We should combat all doping. Where the Americans or Chinese protecting their dirty players? Russia didn't have some people piss hot. They orchestrated a large state sponsored doping program. 
7 Do you have evidence of a current state sponsored American or Chinese doping program that didn't come out of your ass?
1 That's great. Once Lance was proved to be doping, he was stripped of his commendations and banned. Also, Lance was an individual athlete. The context being discussed is a government-wide program where you have an organization come in and systematically dope every athlete representing your country and a huge strategic operation to sneak every single one of them through testing. Is there any evidence that USA has a state-wide program in place to do this for the Olympics?
1 The US government can barely tie it's own shoes lately, let alone commit to a comprehensive conspiracy to rig sports.Oh wait Russia bought the whitehouse.
1 You must be joking.
2 Yeah, all good points. Also, given the fairly substantive links to doping in other countries, it would seem unfair to only punish the Russians for doping. Although the scale of the Russian system is a bit unprecedented.
1 I'd agree with that. I'd also say that if the IOC is this far along in investigating Russia, then it's a bit of a joke that FIFA doesn't appear to have looked into it. But investigating doping is much more taboo in soccer, so it's not too surprising. 
1 No. I've know that word since I was a little kid. My dad used it when talking about the troubles in Ireland back in the 80s. Don't think I'm some dumb teenager who hangs on John Oliver's every word.Also I have been watching Russia very carefully and am fully aware of the theocratic Fascist nightmare that it is becoming. You can say what you like about the US, and I am no fan of a LOT of things that are going on, but the fact of the matter is, I can walk the streets freely here. I literally cannot go to Russia without facing imprisonment. It is closed off to me now, thanks to Putin.You can't hide your sins from me, bucko. 
2 This. You need strong legs to get the sled moving.
15 Makes your hands shake less.
7 In addition to what /u/SHILL_POLICE mentioned, it also gives you a slower heart rate, depressed breathing, and generally suppresses your nervous system to prevent minuscule movements or shakes.
4 Shooting is really fucking stressful when you've got everything riding on your shoulders in the Olympics, Alcohol would definitely help.
1 No. not what you are specifically implying. 
1 Delusional. 
1 I honestly don't care. Just pointing it out.
1 Read again. I said state sponsored.No one is denying there are individual athletes and coaches in the US who cheat. Those people should be banned. But to ban an entire country like Russia requires behavior like Russia exhibited. That is, a *state sponsored* program dedicated to cheating in the Olympics. Again, no one is able to provide a shred of evidence that such a thing has been done by the US.
1 Even the team/coaches being involved in doping isn't the same thing as it happening at a state-sponsored level
-10 Running by an American paper jeah right. I don't but I watching many documentaries about history. I question everything what others write. Blind hate and patriotism is so annoying, it's not USA=good and russia=bad in reality.Russia bashing in everything is not the right thing.That's what I want to say, nothing more. Have a nice day :) btw chill ur dongs I don't hate anyone.
1 You asked a question and then deemed to presume my answer. You're not looking for a conversation.You've managed to engage your brain long enough to remember that sanctions exist, so there's another answer you've managed to think of all by yourself, well done.Let's not pretend you actually care about World War III (or insulting foreign powers) when your post history shows you're pro-nuking North Korea. Idiot.
1 Both. They like being fit, but it also has won them points quite often. When you can sweep hard enough that rocks travel an extra 2-3 inches after a collision, that's massive.
474 AHL players on minor league contracts can go to the Olympics. AHL players on NHL contracts cannot go. 
155 the european leagues in Sweden and Finland are very competitve.  they would most likely shit all over a team of NCAAers, especially on the big ice surface
3 Canada's Spangler cup team was one of the worst I've seen in a while. I really do not have high hopes for this tournament and it's really bumming me out :((((
2 No it's not, Team Canada already showed a projected lineup, it's mostly former NHL players playing over in Europe.
3 Team Canada is mostly NHL busts... Not much interest to me personally, and I'm a HUGE Canadian hockey fan. 
1 That sounds awesome honestly. Boxing does this sort of. I believe you cannot be a paid profesional or something like that if you compete for your country. Lots of boxers started their pro careers like that. 
1 I doubt it’ll extend to the USHL, but since some CHL and ECHL teams are affiliated with NHL or AHL teams then I imagine the ban will cover them. We’ll see though.
1 Junior/NCAA players will be eligible as far as I know, though I wonder if many will be selected.
1 Hopefully a coupla recently retired players (Iggy) decide to take one more shot at gold.
1 Canadian major junior leagues are also holding out players from the olympics as well so a lot of young Canadian talent has been lost there as well. 
1 Team USA seams to be mostly guys playing in Europe or the KHL, hardly any AHL players and no NCAA guys. Team Canada however has two NCAA players. Zach Whitecloud of Bemidji State and Dylan Sikura from Northeastern (who was drafted by the Blackhawks in 14').
1 I think they should've gone "amateur only" the way it used to be. It would be fun to see some unknown players turn into overnight heroes.
82 Gotta convince coach bombay to come out of retirement though 
44 Knucklepuck time
4 FUCK YEAH. 
1 You men were ducking.
32 20 years ago is definitely the good ole days 
4 Well that is 19 years ago. When does something become "the good old days" 
1 And we got our asses kicked in that one.
1 Wait, wasn't that also the year the Undertaker did that thing? You aren't fooling me this time!Oh, nevermind, false alarm, you aren't shittymorph.
1 the Japan games where Jeremy Roenick and other NHL'ers wrecked hotel rooms celebrating to much?
1 For some of us, the good old days ended in 1967 :(
48 Sweden free win
2 Uhhh... there are several pro leagues outside of the NHL and KHL which are much stronger than the NCAA, USHL and even the CHL...
1 I’d watch the shit out of that 
4 Best amateur athletes in the World was always the goal of the olympics. A part of me is glad the NHL did this. Let the “kids” play. 
0 But it's not and it was arguably a more entertaining tournament when the teams were made up of "amateurs" (Red Army Team were pros). 
-3 Well, let's look at it this way: I stopped watching NHL years ago because it became a drafting competition, funding race, and chess game instead of watching people play hockey.  Junior hockey is affordable to go see, somewhat unpredictable, and showcases some great budding talent.  This is what the Olympics used to be about too.I'm not interested in seeing which people who play a sport professionally can win Gold for a country they don't usually even work/live in... I want to see new faces that haven't had their time in the spotlight yet, and see something entertaining with a bit of spectacle."The best" stopped focusing on the Olympics years ago; it's much more profitable to do the professional circuit in whatever sport they do, get paid for it, and get advertising sponsors.
1 Thanks for reminding me why I don't bother watching the Olympics.Although they were rapidly taking down YouTube clips from the summer games.. literally just wanted to watch Usain bolt. I remember it being harder to find the video than I had imagined (this was day of)
28 Yeah I can't put my finger on why the IOC has its officials busted for corruption all the time.  So much cash rolling in.
3 You get that the IOC is non-profit, right?
18 Eh, the spotlight on the sport is HUGE during the Olympics.  NHL reaps the benefit of increased exposure.  It's not huge vs the risk of injury, but not insignificant.  
5 So who was actually responsible for the switch to amateur only athletes to allowing pro teams into the olympics? I always assumed it was the pro teams that drove this. 
1 IOC is all about themselves though it's one of the most corrupt groups out there next to FIFA. Gotta make sure all their chairs stay in the nicest rooms and get the best travel options. 
1 How about letting the players decide?
32 Then they said they would pay the costs if they were allowed to be an official sponsor.IOC said no.
12 This. When they asked the Olympics to cover the costs and got snubbed. The NHL isn't going to pay money to lose money for 3 weeks. I think the IOC is to blame more than the NHL.
3 Those seem like things that the NOC should be paying. And i'm pretty sure the IOC provides housing for all athletes.
1 Is there no Ice Hockey world cup?
0 Oh I get it. I didn't say the owners are wrong. Just that there *is* a number out there that would've prevented this from happening. It's not just about the safety of players or some crap that they'll chalk it up to. It's about $$$. Nothing wrong with that.
1 So? Shouldn’t be up to the league but the players themselves. If a player wants to represent his country at the olympics the league should back off. 
1 Again, I'm not arguing for or against the owners or the IOC. I'm just saying it's about money, not player safety.
1 > They wanted the IOC to pay for insurance and travel costs for their players, that got rejected.That's something the NOC should pay for.>but the IOC offered absolutely nothing in return for interrupting their league and providing the best players for one of the bigger events.
5 Well they do care about injuries and interruption but they also only care about those things because of money.John Tavares out for half of a season? That costs a lot for a team.
5 True, but if Sidney Crosby gets hurt in the Olympics and is out the rest of the season, it will cost them money at the gate. So they do care about injuries, but not because they give a damn about player safety, it's because of the bottom line.
16 I mean, obviously? That's not really a negative thing. 
3  The leagues biggest stars go. A player getting injured could jeopardize the rest of the season. They definitely care about injuries.
2 Actually they do care about injuries and interruptions. It's the owners of the teams who made the decision to not go, so if one of their star players gets injured it could affect the amount of money they bring in. Same as schedule interruptions, they don't get money from the Olympics, so it takes a big chunk out of the season and messes up scheduling with other events taking place in the stadiums.
1 But the IOC is a charity and doesn't care about money? At worst the NHL is just as bad.
1 Welcome to planet Earth.
1 They do care about injuries but it is definitely 2nd behind money
0 > (since hockey is BY FAR the biggest revenue generator for the olympics)That's a joke? 
3 > or better yet, have both.Basketball does this with the Olympics as well as the FIBA world cup, and NBA players participate in both.It's awesome and I would love to see hockey in the same situation. 
3 The only problem to this is that the World Cup of Hockey they had last year did not generate the revenue they were hoping for, for both the players and the NHL. 
5 I was under the impression that the WCH was meant to be the NHL's replacement for the Olympics.
1 They tried to reboot it last year. The last one before that was 1996 I think, and then it died.But it was boring last year, no team came close to beating Canada. And hockey in the summer...even hardcore hockey fans have a hard time getting interested in that.
1 Well when the US has 29/30 teams of course they'll win the world series the vast majority of years
1 Ah, okay. I didn't know that. Thanks!
1 To add just a small bit to this as, the on ice risk can also increase when skating against lower skilled teams. More slashes and high sticks, just loser control period. A pro also isn't immune to a bad check from behind or kneeing. 
1 Ah interesting I was wondering about that NHL control aspect.
1 2010, that's rightJeez, that doesn't feel like very long ago for some reason.
2 That's fair, I was generalizing,  But the Olympics bring professional hockey to world stage that just doesn't bring as much attention anywhere else.
20 It uses gimmicks to manufacture excitement and competition, like having a team Europe and team North America (best NA young players). 
16 It's like a mini Olympics tournament. It blows because it's a cash grab and doesn't hold the same weight and national pride as the Olympics does. As a Canadian I watched and was happy Canada won, but it wasn't the same as watching the Olympics and feeling that national pride of your country winning in an event watched and loved around the world. 
5 I'm sure that the fact that none of the players ever dreamed of winning the World Cup of Hockey has something to do with it too... One other thing that may make a difference is the stage at which some of these players are at. They are already playing the most competitive league in the planet, showcasing their skills on a world cup is not going to be worth it in terms of getting recognition and perhaps a better contract as they are already at that level. With soccer players, because there are so many competitive leagues in Europe, most want to play in as many international tournaments as they can as it is, or can be, a launchpad to their career. Do you honestly think that Crosby or Kane want to do well in that league so they can get a contract to play the KHL?? 
5 They had it in 2016 for the first time in a while, it's compromised of 7 teams composed of NHL players. It was quite exciting actually. A bit gimmicky (they had Team USA, Team Canada, and Tell North America (players under 24) but Team NA was incredible to watch.
4 to each his own but seriously? Thats like saying chuckie Cheese has the best pizza. 
2 Lol it's not even close to as good as the Olympics.
2 I agree. The players actually took it seriously and it was fun to watch. Slap a jersey on of their home country and they’ll play their hearts out. 
1 Your an idiot and nobody likes you.
1 Mostly to go, but they have contacts
1 If I want to take 10 weeks of vacation per year (even unpaid) and my employer only wants to give me 2 weeks, what happens?Employment is an agreement that requires *both* parties to agree to the terms, not just one, in order to maintain the agreement.
35 I want to watch the best players in the world compete as well, but why don't you ask the Ottawa Senators how that went?They had the best goalie in the league and were looking to make a good run in the playoffs. Then their goalie took a season ending injury in the first game of the olympcs and they lost in the second round.So why should the NHL send their best players when they have nothing to gain and a ton to lose?
6 As a hockey fan who understands the negotiations that occurred...it is the right move.
8 The IOC is a hard-nosed money-grubbing machine that wrings billions from cynically monetizing the affection people hold for Olympic symbolism. I'm not the least bit opposed to the NHL treating them for what they are.
2 Most players are furious about it 
2 They don't get more views otherwise they'd go.
1 That was actually part of this situation. When talks were happening with the NHL and IOC and it started to look like the NHL was gonna pull out the players started to get pissed about it and went to the NHLPA. Many believed it was in the CBA that they could go to the Olympics because of their participation in previous Olympics and were furious when they found out that it is never mentioned in the current CBA.It was a big mess with many players pissed at the NHLPA heads for not having it part of the CBA and looking for a way to go. The NHL offered the NHLPA to let them go to the Olympics on the condition that they extend the current CBA past the opt out date which I believe is in 2019. Since there are several other issues they have with the current CBA the NHLPA said no and here were are.This is just the NHL/NHLPA negotionations and does not include the issues between the NHL and IOC. That is a whole different can of worms.For my personal opinion I think the NHL has a problem with thinking they are smarter and more powerful then they actually are. There real issue here wasn't with insurance or travel, both were offered to be covered by the IIHF and many NOCs. The real issue is the lack of hard benefits for the NHL. They wanted something tangible from the IOC; advertising, partnership, rights to game video and audio, ect. The problem is the IOC deals with many sports leagues and if they give in to the NHL then every league is going to pull the same stunt.; NBA,KHL,all the soccer leagues,ect. They are also walking away from direct exposure for their players and indirect exposure for their teams. Though the NHL logo isn't shown the players are and their teams are mentioned during the broadcasts. You are still getting your franchises mentioned and your stars showcased.Lastly it seems like part of this is that the NHL sees no benefit to South Korea. There has already been talk about the NHL wanting to return for 2022 because they want to grow the game in China. That assumes the IOC is going to play this game and let them pick and choose which countries they want to compete in. I honestly don't see that happening.
1 It'll be another point for negotiation, and the league will get something as a concession for allowing it. The players can potentially share in the financial risks of Olympic participation. The league can figure out exactly how much money it's worth and how much it's worth to players, it's not rocket science -- and not likely to lead to a lockout.
4 In soccer, this is done through FIFA, who cover insurance (payable to clubs) for players participating in national team duty at FIFA sanctioned events, of which the Olympics is one. However, it's a bit different of a situation than the NHL providing insurance the insurance, which would be to themselves, and therefore wouldn't make as much sense.
3 Most pro sports don't have to shut down their season, mid season for the Olympics though. Big difference.
5 The IOC doesnt run its tournaments during any other pro leagues regular season.  Its why baseball isnt in the summer olympics.      The IOC also refused to allow the NHL to use any clips or media from the games.  so the NHL is supposed to send its players to korea, let them beat themselves up in the middle of the season risking injury which could dmg ratings back home, swallow any medical costs related to injury, AND not be able to use any of the footage, whatsoever, to promote your players when they get back?  meanwhile the IOC is literally pocketing billions of dollars?      yea, its totally all on the NHL.
2 I'd be curious if they do this for basketball, seems like the NHL and NBA should be in similar situations. 
2 Hard to tell, you'd have to compare similar league contact sports. Maybe football... Is football an Olympic sport? 
2 The NHL provides funding to the IIHF who in turn funds a number of grass roots hockey programs. They said they would pay it but they would have to cut funding to other programs to make it work. The IOC was offered a number of alternatives to make this work and refused.
1 Not at a spectator event level
1 This is a guy who refers to NHL players as "assets".
10 Not an American, and I get their viewpoint. Tough shit.
2 Da FUq? That's the dumbest thing I ever read. The IOC and sports are about generating entertainment business not "love" of the game. They always have been about making money. 
1 > Players are competitors and the Olympics are one of the greatest thing a competitor could participate in. Not too many professionals see it that way though.  There is some pride for the country they qualify to play for but they're seeing better teams every night from mixed squads.
2 No, because the star players play for particular teams *within* the league, meaning those teams would lose advantage versus other teams if one of their stars gets injured.
1 I don't think it's completely greedy on the NHL's part, if the NHL is similar to the NFL in player contracts. A player can forfeit a lot of money by getting hurt, enough to where he can't play, outside of performing his duties as a player (games/practices). Insurance from the IOC would cover that, I'm sure, since it's in service of the sport.
0 God forbid they want to protect their investments.
1 They could, but they would have to mutually agree to terminate their NHL contracts with the club they are a part of.  Ilya Kovalchuk for example, left his NHL contract with 12 years remaining on the deal. If he returned today, he would only be allowed to return to the devils and he basically walked out on millions of dollars. He's a great player, and got an obvious opportunity in the KHL but many of the lesser NHL players like Michael Raffl, would fear not getting another contract at all. At least a contract that lives up the money they are earning in the NHL. The clubs are also unwilling to do this a lot of the time, because of penalties. If you terminate a signed contract there is consequences everyone has to face
1 The Olympics is a massive deal to hockey players, a number of huge NHL talents/stars are pissed off at the decision and have made it known to the public. Some have threatened to go anyway and deal with the consequences. This is especiallly true for European/Russian players whose countrymen didn't play in the NHL when they were growing up/who didn't watch the NHL growing up due to time differences. The highest level of play they saw was the Olympics, and there were natural regional rivalries to make it even better.Joining a different league would mean sacrificing your career for all intents and purposes. The NHL is the best league in the world with the most earning potentially by a long shot. Earnings are far higher, the quality of competition is far higher, the employment opportunities after hockey are better, etc. It is the league every hockey player aspires to join. It's foolish to say they can just join another league. They also have to consider their families and contracts as well as 
1 The vast majority of team canada is centermen.They usually run multiple centers on each line. I.E Crosby - Bergeron
1 Nope, most of Canada’s team will be KHL players. Even if the KHL backs out you’ll see a bunch of players based out of Sweden, Finland and Switzerland playing for Canada.
1 Team NA and Team Europe won't be in future tournaments. They didn't have time for qualifications so this was a quick fix.
1 It is, but the summer games are during the NBA off-season, so players have time to heal if they get hurt. For the NHL, they would have to take a 2 week break in the middle of the season, and some of their best players might be out for the most important part of the season.
1 Yes it does. But the IOC doesn't give two shits about pro sports leagues. They're all about "do it for love of country", while keeping the quite lucrative profits for themselves. So really you have two for-profit groups competing with each other, they don't always get along. That's said a lot of players will compete anyway, because of that love of country.
1 Is that a half y at the end or has mobile lost its mind
6 Oh I am sure they wouldn't have won anyway.
-6 Injuries happen. Hell Hasek could have pulled a groin getting out of the bath tub, or in practice. 
1 PROTIP: Look at the scheduling for the WCoH and for the Olympics.
0 The NHL doesn't want it's season messed up or it's players injured... Because that costs money.
1 The NHL sponsored that so they make money on it, I guess?  I'm not saying it makes sense, I'm just repeating the NHL's reasoning for pulling out of the Olympics.https://www.nhl.com/news/history-shows-olympics-dont-help-nhl/c-288389004
1 Look, I prefer the Olympics to the WCoH, but the WCoH was at the beginning of the year, so it was unlikely to affect a team’s Cup hopes. Yes it could have, but it’s far less likely, because it’s not in the later half of the season. Also, the IOC wouldn’t let the NHL use ANY highlights from the Olympics in their promotional material, so the NHL would have to A) Halt their season, B) Loan players away, C) Absorb all risk, for literally no gain. The NHL is not the best-run League, but let’s not say they’re as greedy as the IOC. 
1 IT'S PLAYED IN THE OFF-SEASON, NOT DURING THE PLAYOFF RACE AT THE END OF THR REGULAR SEASON
3 The Stanley Cup is waaaaay more important to North American hockey players than an olympic gold medal. Not sure about Europe.
1 Ah, I guess I remembered wrong, I knew they took a break but I guess they made up the games later. 
50 So does hockey, but instead of having hundreds of nations try to qualify, the NHL simply chose six and added two gimmick teams full of the rest the world to make 8.It was probably the worst hockey tournament ever.
10 We've got Bettman's World Cup of Hockey though which is totally the exact same thing and definitely doesn't suck compared to actual Olympic hockey
3 There´s no World cup for Hockey?
3 Soccer in the Olympics is so pointless with more or less u23 teams.
2 It’s mostly South America’s and African teams that take the Olympic Games seriously European don’t really, we have the European Championships and the World Cup,  Olympic football is just Meh 
1 Wait, I'm confused? There *is* a world cup. I'm watching the IIHF event every year and the US partakes in it.http://2018.iihfworlds.com/
1 Also there's age restrictions for olympic football.
1 And guess who is hosting the World Cup :DNow guess who is not going to the World Cup *(hint:It's USA)*Karma is a bitch.
-6 Soccer in the olympics is more interesting than the world cup typically though. Only being allowed 3 (or whatever the number is) veteran players completely changes who the powerhouse teams are.
0 Not really. That’s why it’s always highlighted. Nice try though. 
5 We have a tight grip on the world's maple syrup supply as well 
1 Hey, we also have a strangle hold on... on... shut up.
0 Beer helps.
1 World juniors are dominated by high draft picks though, a lot of who end up as stars in the NHL, so that may not be the best comparison to what the Olympics will be. I believe any player under contract is not permitted to go under the current arrangement, so the big guns you would typically see in World Juniors are out as well. I'm not looking for another Spengler's Cup in the Olympics. Give me some Crosby - McDavid - Mckinnon vs Gudreau - Auston - Eichel
10 No, but when you're used to watching the world's best players competing in the world's premiere international tournament, it's schmucky to insinuate that having a bunch of minor leaguers and college kids replacing them will be just as fun to watch. 
2 i mean, pretty much yeah.  
2 That was also 40 years ago lol
1 Which is why the Summit Series was much better
2 > Every four years I get a migraine. God I hate curling. Such a racket. I'd rather listen to Japanese porn.This comment. Thank you Reddit.
1 Most people say you know they can't believe. 
33 Those relatively strong european leagues are full of all the second tier north american players as well. I dunno. I feel like without the NHL (and KHL if they don't join) the olympics is essentially just the Spengler Cup with a few rearranged teams.. And Canada does just fine at the Spengler Cup so I'm not sure I buy an argument that the favorites change at all without NHL and KHL players.
1 The minor leagues players can go to the olympics this year, but only if they have a contract with the minors and not one with the major but are only in the minors for whatever reason. I think there are a few players who play NHL on a minor contract for the reason of being able to go to the Olympics this year. [Here is a hockey news article about it](http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/players-on-ahl-contracts-can-head-to-olympics-here-are-eight-candidates)

-1 No, lol there won't be CHL or NCAA players. They'll just be Canadians/Americans from Russia, Sweden, Finland, and the AHL. 
2 Miracle on Ice is so compelling exactly because the Red Army team *was* the best International team. If Russia's team wasn't arguably one of the greatest international teams ever than beating them isn't the "miracle on ice" for America.
1 Super confusing that you are excited for women's hockey if you're complaining about how 4 good teams isn't competitive enough. Women's hockey has 2.

597 Someone made a case for doping in sports, specifically the Tour de France. The idea wasn't to make doping voluntary, but actually mandatory. However, you wouldn't know what you were getting, you just had to stick that hand of yours into a bowl and take whatever you grabbed.Thinking about it now, I'm realizing that the idea would be to essentially just turn the Tour de France into the 'Drug Olympics' episode of Blue Mountain State.... Idk, I'd watch it.
26 Yea, but I want it where they're not trying to hide it and use only trace amounts. I want it to be like superhumans competing against each other doing things that a normal person can't do even if they trained their entire life. I'm curious to see how far we can push the limits of the human body.
4 "Our 'roided up guy beat your 'roided up guy!" -Bill Burr
4 The fact that Russia isn't absolutely DOMINATING the Olympics should tell you that everyone's doping to some degree.
1 They should just do a fully and shamelessly doped up superhuman olympics. It’d be the most insanely entertaining thing on TV
1 Ba-dum tseee! 
1 Sure, but that’s also not really unique to Sochi. The Russians were just the ones that got caught.
1 Or Rio, or many of the ones before all that
1 So is every other Olympic and major sports event. Rugby doesn't have doping issues, guess why?
1 Just about every Olympian is doping, and there is no reason to think otherwise. If they weren't, someone who was would be in their place. Maybe some shit-tier nobodies from tiny countries aren't, which is part of why they place horribly.  You can't even walk into a commercial gym without encountering people on steroids, so the idea that a professional athlete competing on the international stage wouldn't be enhanced is kinda preposterous. They're relatively cheap, difficult to test for, and extremely easy to find. I think a lot of people are very naive about how prevalent they are. 
214 I want an Olympic event where the competitors draw random events. Like you've been training for the 100 meter dash and then you draw diving.
23 And how far will it go? Would a participant be expected to live to collect their medal? Would a government push those participants into such a situation?'I can make you a superman for 20 min''Great, the event is only 12.'
37 It's bound to happen. It just requires a lack of ethics and a thirst for profits. In a way, it's puzzling it hasn't happened yet.
4 I'm pretty sure that ends in a death match brawl every time.
1 I think you mean within some rules still. I still want humans to play, and to play a sport not have everyone fight to the death.
3 I remember a Popular Science or similar magazine doing a short article on just such an event. It would be set up with the same or similar sports but without chemical limits. I'll try to Google it later. RemindMe!They should also always have an average Joe doing the event simultaneously so people can see how the pseudo-Olympians compare. 
3 Yep. Isn't it for viewers and ratings anyway? If athletes are willing to do it even when it's illegal imagine how much more spectacular it could be if everything was legal? 
1 > I want an Olympic event where all competitors are allowed to do anything for an edge. That would be very interesting.Would be a tad short though. No events would last longer than the time it takes to fire a single armor piercing round.
5 I think you mispronounced, “hunger games”
1 So pretty much the current Olympics.  You are fooling yourself if you don't think they are all doping in some way.  It's just a matter of not getting caught. 
1 I want one where the competitors must kill each other for survival, and the last one alive gets a bunch of money and fame. We can also force the "undesirables" to compete. ^^^^/s
1 LOL turbines attached to swimmers as replacement limbs sounds fair!
1 Speed chess where you can kick your opponent in the balls.
1 Like kneecapping opponents? 
1 [It would look like this](https://view.yahoo.com/show/saturday-night-live/clip/4973328/weekend-update-all-drug-olympics).
1 [Anything for an edge?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=voUMQrLy_uY)
12 Yep. Plenty of athletes will still be doping next time around. Games without Russian athletes won't change that. The Russian were unlucky, getting caught red-handed. Everyone needs to watch *Icarus*.
0 "The Vladolympicsteroids"FTFY
14 I've been saying for years that there should be 2 different Olympics, the regular Olympics, and the steroid Olympics where competitors can dope up all they want. That way we get less people cheating in the regular games, and get to see how far the human body can be pushed in the steroid games. 
71 brings new meaning to the term ladyboner though.
5 And dangerous. But also sick.
3 I’ve always said I want them to make a second olympics where doping, steroids, all that is allowed and encouraged. Let’s see how far the human body can really go. 
1 Remember the XFL? This kind of stuff is never as fun as you'd think it is. 
1 I love how the power-lifter isnt in any pain just disappointed
1 I recall being rather scarred by that segment as a kid...
1 I want to see people throw javelins out of the stadium.
1 Bear vaultingBear wrestlingBear shootingBear everything
10 Yes but she didn't cheat (blatantly enough to be caught) as the Soviets had. The point of banning doping is because normies can't compare.
1 You mean to tell me there was a gymnast better than Mary Lou Retton?Next you’ll tell me there was someone faster than Carl Lewis.Ruin my childhood why don’t you.
1 > He is saying that if you compare video footage of Soviet gymnasts at the Friendship Games, they are clearly better than Mary Lou Rhetton.Definite proof that the Russians weren't cheating back in 1984.
3 I interpreted it the opposite way. I hope he clarifies what he means.
0 Yeah kinda  why I am confused. 
1 I'd bet Kristy burger on the Russians winning ... What Russia are boycotting...how much do we stand to lose....
1 Yes and yes
1 Way better than the eimpsons, imo. And yeah, start at the beginning. 
1 It became toxic. It doesn't provide anymore PR benefits. It's the opposite. It pretty rational to switch attention to something else.
1 They spent all that time/money for the olympics hosted in their country. Now that it’s over they don’t care. 
1 They just wanted to use it as a way to glorify Russia, if they can't participate that reason disappears
1 They got what they wanted from their investment and then some, no problem for a smart businessman to walk away from an investment after it’s already peaked and is now on the downswing.
1 > What did they tell their athletes?Who cares.> I wonder what the endgame plan could possibly be.As Machiavelli stated people in power is only concerned with staying in power.
10 How about countries like Greece?
6 > How does it feel to be the only developed country that's more of a shit show than the US?When Russia become developed country ? CIA Factbook doesn't list Russia as developed country.As for the answer:It's ok. I am programmer. As of yet no my potential employer was able to convince me to leave Russia.
4 I'm all for some good old fashioned US shitposting, but this shit reads out of a 15 year old's edgelord coloring book.There are some things Russia has over the US. Larger landmass. More East Orthodox practitioners. Superior persecution of gays and political outsiders.
-2 >How does it feel to be the only developed country that's more of a shit show than the US?Well, it seem like a bait, but i will take it. Actually US is far superior shit show than Russia.
1 > Putin is still insanely popularDictators that have near total control over mass media tend to be that way.

That's simply evil.
1 "Better the devil you know", eh?
1 Russian here, your summary's mostly correct. Plenty people don't even give a shit if he's a corruptionaire or not. Not saying that that's good, it's just the Russian view. Anyone will steal, at least this one does something else, too.
1 Pretty much, yeah. Before Putin there were constant wars between oligarchs and mafia groups and Putin somehow dealt with it. He dealt with Chechnya, there is shady stuff going on but it's more or less under Kremlin control. It was much worse before. Now we don't have real alternatives to Putin because any promising politic is shoved from scene before they can get attention, so people vote for Putin and it's kind of vicious cycle. And when Putin will die there will be massive fight for influence with all nasty things we left in 90s.

6 Funny thing about your comment—that attempt at whataboutism/tu-quoque/"two wrongs make a right" is explicitly taught to Russian FSB agents. This is then disseminated among all the trolls hired by Putin. So tell me, do two wrongs make a right logically? One can only deflect for so long before walls close in.
1 Thanks for covering my laziness.  Since you did the legwork I'll edit in the YouTube link. 
1 'Voyeur' is on Netflix. Gay Talese actually experienced it first hand so it's him releasing a story about it after so many years with the Voyeur's approval and appearance in the film. 
1 *Spoilers*Yeah. The filmmaker (Bryan?) spends the first half of the movie doping and building up to compete in the Haute Route, and builds up to a climax of seeing him perform (compared to his first try clean, where he finished poorly).Then his rear derailleur lets him down (which is relatively quick fix if you have a spare) and then they write off everything about the race.Chronologically speaking, yes they finished the storyline. But they didn't really resolve the first half of the movie which was how much further he would get with doping.
1 It's why Russia, far more so than many other nations, seems to be *obsessed* with competition. The Olympics, Eurovision, international hockey, etc. It's like they see these competitions as an extension of *war*, and they get incredibly petty and butthurt whenever they lose. A few years ago, for example, after they lost to Canada in the World Hockey Championships, they walked off the ice during the Canadian anthem. 
1 It's crazy that a ton of Russians actually think like that.
1 I told someone online a few weeks ago Americans like the Russian people just fine. It's their govt. we have problems with.I hope this helped. 
-2 >rest of the world>everyone elseDo you honestly believe that what West thinks = world opinion? I'm from India, no one here hates Russia. I'm sure in neighboring China it's similar, they quite like them actually. Latin America? Africa? Middle East? All of them hate Russia? You sure about that?
64 Yeah, thats a common tactic to watch out for. They frequently deflect criticism of Russia back to something about the USA.Most of the time its not equivalent, like the US does not have the reputation for killing journalists and whistle blowers.Even when it is equivalent, it's just irrelevant whataboutism. The crimes of other countries don't make Russias okay.

11 [United States Federal Witness Protection Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Witness_Protection_Program) is run by the US Marshals, which is what I was referring to, and who will be protecting this man. Witness protection by the San Francisco Police Department is not the same at all, as apparently California, NY, and a few others have their own programs. On another note in your case, the witness did not follow his own program and returned to an old hangout.>However, Harris said, "I can't understand why (Rollins) would want to come back to a place were we all knew -- that he knew -- was a place where he would expect this type of outcome."The first and last rule in witness protection is, don't go back to your danger zone," Harris said.

1 The only ones that got outed were ones that ran out on their protectors and returned to their old hangouts. The Program itself has never failed. Federal WPP, run by the US Marshals btw.
1 It is like saying though that a Self-Driving Car has never gotten into an accident, the only accidents that they have been in are when the self driving feature was off and then a Human Driver crashed the car. The Program didn't fail, the Witnesses failed out of the Program.

1 I don't think this is the case.  There are numerous reports of the government fixing elections.  Also, it's hard to lose an election when all the popular alternatives are jailed or killed.  
1 At least Putin is actually charismatic, making the propaganda effective. What excuse does US have?
1 You know what makes Putin more Popular? Banning Russia from the Olympics. 
1 >feeble-minded and easily given to propaganda and constant, easy to spot lying.This is one of the most popular bullshit myths. Do you really believe that nation that haven't believed into bullshit of dictatorship and propaganda of, far superiour than Putin, USSR - can buy into his shit? Putin is popular, because he is popular. Reasons why everyone vote for Putin is because there 3 clowns and no decent candidates from opposition, because the only two things they do are shitting all over Putin and blaming him for everything even things he have no power over and calling russian people slaves for reelecting Putin. Great idea to create decent amount of supporters. /sThe average program of Russian opposition leader #3459 consist of "Putin is bad. Truth and Lies", "Populism instead of Ideas and Plans. Chapter 1", "I'm not a Putin, but i act like him", "We should be with West. Collusion in politics. How to spot Trump" and if they not really want to become president "Protests. How to get onto BBC frontpage for the grants. Step by step guide."
2 I definitely think it's almost impossible, but if Russians woke the FUCK up and realized their president is a murdering, mobbed up thief and lowlife criminal scumbag... maybe in ten years?
1 Just by this sentence you justified every Putin action. That's exact reason why a lot of people support him.
6 Michael Hastings was just going on his usual 90 mph drive through residential neighborhoods
1 Also those two other former directors of Russian Anti-Doping Agency who just mysteriously died just before they could be questioned. Very unfortunate indeed. 
182 There's a fairly significant difference between jailing a whistleblower for violating existing laws and outright killing them. 
90 But not because he would be killed, but because he would be found guilty of treason. 
3 And that's pretty irrelevant info. Pretty sure Russia cares about a whistleblower who makes their own country look bad a lot more then a foreigner whistleblower who makes a different country (a country they dislike on top of it) look bad. 
3 Wait, are you suggesting the US is comparable to Russia because a man who broke the law in the US fled to Russia to not end up in jail?Da, that's totally the same as poisoning journalists with radioactive isotopes. Democracy is ruse, comrade. 
2 He's not Russian though. That's the difference. 
2 How is that even relevant
5 I'd rather have 7 years in prison like Chelsea Manning than life in Russia.
3 Chelsea Manning spent 7 years in jail, but it's alive and now it's a free woman. 
1 > he ran to Russia.odd coincidence eh?
1 You really think that's a logical thought?  Putin would whack any fucking journalist or govt whistleblower in a nanosecond, if it's against his own self interests and they're Russian and in Russia.  He's not gonna whack american whistleblowers who directly shit all over the US and make us look terrible, because that directly and materially serves his own interests.
0 Chelsea Manning was held in solitary confinement for years, through multiple suicide attempts. 
47 Are you trying to say that Russia doesn't have a horrible well deserved reputation for killing whistleblowers and journalists? Are the human rights watchdogs wrong about them?I don't get the point of your whataboutism. 
26 I'll take solitary over polonium, thanks.  That said, USA is also only one country.  If your best defense of Russia is "but it's still way better to be the worst-treated whistleblower in the USA" then I'm not sure where you're headed.edit:Some of you seem to think summary execution is better than solitary confinement.  I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, but I doubt most people who survived solitary still wish, after the fact, that they had been executed instead.  Turns out people like living, even the ones who feel suicidal sometimes.
11 That's a waterboardin'.

6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_ManningForever == 7 years.
6 No evidence of US outright murdering whistle blowers, but they sure as fuck try to jail the shit out of them. 
1 Though the other names are suspicious, could you explain why Ted Stevens and Pat Tillman are on your list?I looked lightly into them and neither of them were whistleblowers nor do I see reason to believe the US government was responsible for their deaths.EDIT: Well going through your post history I can guess why you included them.
6 Ah the good old two shot suicide
2 An average Russian thinks that this scandal is made up. There are two main positions that most people have in mind. Some think that doping is an endemic thing (and leaks by Fancy Bears about Serena Williams are but a glimpse on what is actually happening for every country)Some think that Rodchenkov is a criminal that was about to get caught and chose to find a safe haven in exchange for participating in a fake process. Most think that both positions are valid simultaneously. 
25 People without at least an intelligent child's grasp on reality annoy the fuck out of me. Willfully ignorant adults who swallow unsophisticated propaganda that's inconsistent in itself make me want to murder someone.

1 >  but just as bad.Yeah, because Trump is locking up and killing gays
6 It's trying to have one. It's FoxNews unofficially but then the official Trump TV parrots FoxNews. 
1 >  the US doesn't have a propaganda machineLOL!
4 > Besides, the US doesn't have a propaganda machine.Okay buddy. Sure thing.
8 This isn't a what about America comment,  it's a correlation about Trump trying to use Putin's Tactics. 
0 Which is why I'm not scared of Trump, but he is using the same tactics 
1 No it’s not. 
2 Most cases of them competing under the Olympic flag have been relatively minor.  Half a dozen or a dozen athletes from a country that doesn't exist anymore, or is under heavy sanctions.  Certainly not with what is usually the second or third largest contingent in the Games.  And it may well be that Russia will just decide to pull funding from anyone who competes as an Independent drastically reducing the number who actually compete.
4 SOUND THE BEIGE ALERT.And if I don't survive, tell my wife hello.
122 These individual athletes were testing clean before and getting past the system. We only know about the doping because of whistle-blowers.Lance Armstrong never failed a test in his career either.
47 Or bribe the testers. But nobody would do that...
2 It's the 75th anniversary of the battle of Stalingrad. When it comes to WW2 the Russians are Nationalistic. Millions died and they didn't give up, and won. If the Russians gave up after suffering what the French did we would be speaking German.

14 Blind pride in your country no matter what it does or has done or will do in the future is a very, very bad thing.
30 And what's the problem with that? Why should anyone have pride in a country that systematically does bad things? What the hell are you even proud about? The US has done some pretty fucked up things and I am not proud of my country because of how it treats its lowest social class. Am I just supposed to act like I'm proud of the country anyways because of this ridiculous concept of blind nationalism? No thank you.
4 This was a "systematically bad thing" directly related to sport. So how about it stops at bad things directly related to sport....?
6 Your country is not just your politicians, it's your people too. 
4 If you country is disproportionately currently doing systematically bad things, you probably shouldn't be proud of it. You should work to change it
5 You take the good with the bad, I guess.  I have some pretty mixed feelings about the US for example and am deeply ashamed of us for a lot of reasons right now but overall I think we're a positive global force for technological innovations, international peace-keeping and promoting human rights, despite some obvious crimes and missteps.
0 >no one could possibly have any pride in any country at this point. How is that a bad thing?Honestly, I don't understand all the pride and patriotism thing. It just makes you less likely to question the desicions and policies of the state.
-5 Read what you just wrote. Now read it slower a second time. Now evener slowwwwer a third time. Ok. Get why that's a problem? Good.
1 I'm not entirely following your comment, but if you think what the Russians have been up to is no different from the rest of the world (except maybe China in 2008) then you haven't been paying attention. Russia is a 3rd rate economy that has had outsized influence in the world in part because of the geopolitics of international sport. As we are coming to learn, Russia is busy meddling in just about everything it can to maintain its influence. I'm very glad the IOC finally did something about this.
2 This is the only time something like this worked out. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_OlympicsMaybe they try something to this effect again?

1 Russia or not Fifa is always above board /s/
8 Not sure if joke, but the gist of it is that the rest of Europe has grown despite Britain falling behind.  Essentially, the average went up despite some individuals going down.
1 America's place on the globe was already number 1 when Putin became president.
1 But Trump!!!In all seriousness while Trump has made a lot of noise at this point very few Americans have had any change in their lives that wouldn't have occurred if Obama was still president. Not to say that excuses any issues he has caused just that the chaotic image the media paints is not particularly accurate. That may change in the coming years (Obamacare changes, tax changes and such) but the US Government is a huge machine that the president can't change all that quickly. Particularly one that is not experienced in government.
1 Germany took in more immigrants than most and their economy is booming.  You do hear of terror attacks happening from time to time, but you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be in a terror attack.  This is mostly media-hype.

1 Which flavor of kool-aid do you like better, grape or cherry?
1 Most of my points were actually long term losses in comparison with their short term gains. They are currently looking strong but that's build on no foundation and they will lose quite a lot in the future because they wanted to act strong now.The international leverage they lost by invading crimea will hurt them A LOT in the long term. The fact they alienate and threaten other countries constantly will hurt them A LOT in the long term. Russia does not have the ability to prosper on its own and once they lost their leverage because countries get more independent from gas and oil they will suffer for it.Putin is actively alienating all the major players and the only reason he does so is because he can keep power by showing strength to his people (Similarly like Trump shows strength by alienating his allies) while he lets the country bleed out further for his oligarchy friends. It's a classic dictatorship strategy, tell your people that everybody is your enemy and they will band together under you. Make sure that everybody sees you as the enemy and you can keep your power indefinitely.Once this whole construct falls the people will see that they were played as fools for a long time. And that won't end well for russia
3 They were better off as little as 10 years ago than they are now, when the price of oil was being inflated.  Without that as their economic backbone, they're just trying to hold onto a former glory for as long as they can.
1 They're not better because of their shady tactics. They're better because it was almost impossible to stay in the hole they had fallen in in the 90s. That wasn't Russia's natural state, they have too much infrastructure, skills and connections to stay as ungodly poor as they were in 90s, especially while sitting on the biggest pile of resources in the world.       Actually most ex-socialist European countries progressed more since the 90s despite not having a fraction of Russia's natural wealth. And the countries that didn't progress as much are the ones that remained under Russia's influence like Ukraine, Moldova, the Caucus.         So Putin's performance has been below average despite Russia having more potential.
1 This, nukes are what keeps Russia relevant on the world stage.
1 You're thinking about this like a westerner and that's a very common mistake. Russians just love to suffer and die for any great cause they can find well-being be damned.
2 YOU HEARD THE MAN TIME FOR AMERICA TO DELIVER SOME FREEDOM TO MR PUTIN
9 That's sad. Though the upcoming elections will be a sham anyway. Putin won't give up power because of something as silly as the will of the people.
1 Went there to have a look, this sub is insane. Completely biaised, claiming fake news at every turn, blaming "western propaganda". It's basically a place to glorify Putin.It reminds me of anoTher_subreDdit...
1 I guess it's been stronger. Putin is gaining, if not winning, on the cyberwar front and that's huge.
0 The fact that it's sports... And it doesn't actually affect anything... I get it- there are a lot of positives from the Olympics. Patriotism, role models, etc. But really it doesn't mean anything. 
3 Yeah, that's why they emigrated, I suppose. But they were right in a sense, of course. The ass that the country was in was so deep that in some sense there was no other way but up, eventually. At least, today's standard of living of an average Russian is, historically, highest-ever. 
11 For state sanctioned, organised, and led doping? Why wouldn't he deserve blame for that?
0 Russians are supportive of Putin though and that’s with western polling not Russian polling. The reality is the west isn’t trusted much by your everyday Russian anyway. Many of them still blame the west for how shitty things got in Russia post Cold War especially since the USA helped sponsor Yeltsin’s sell offs in 96 the west has a particularly bad reputation in Russia. I don’t think it’s entirely feasible for a Russian leader to cozy up with the west without losing support of the people. There is a cultural divide there that can’t be simply bridged 
1 > They competed in the space race against the US. ... Competed? How 'bout Won.
1 Sure they do. Lots of countries do. Unfortunately in the former Soviet Union most of the alternatives to ex KGB strongmen are oligarchs, which aren't that much better. More freedom and better human rights with those, but they also drain state coffers for personal gain. 
1 Not really. Yeltsin was a laughing stock who mismanaged the country badly and allowed state assets to be sold off willy nilly and crime lords duel it out in the streets.  
1 - Permanent UN SC seat- Nukes- One of world's biggest militaries- Top 5 in intelligence services- Global player in internet hacking - Extensive oil and gas reservesThe country may be in shit shape economically, a de facto dictatorship and have a woeful human rights record but they are still a global player 
1 The US is partially complicit in the destruction of Syria due to arming rebels to fight Assad. It's a very typical proxy war of the 21st Century, and neither the US or Russia have clean hands.
1 >> I like how you say all of this as if Russia doesn't spend an unholy amount of time inventing propaganda against Western countries and flat out lying to their citizens and the world.Well, And then I can come to reddit, read it, looking for objective investigations, good example of journalism, so called democracy and so on...and to be shocked from what I read, and go back to Russia forums. There in comments I clearly see how people separate lie from true and form justice. Here- not. Here is see just how again Russia is bad and in which form. No one even try to discuss, unlike Russian forums. Dam, it's so obvious, then you don't leave in this ocean of western media noise and has no pre-defind opininion. >> You guys really need to make your social media work more subtle.I even can't link it any of my comments. What do you mean? What Russian media do you watch to know what do we see?
4 the “sad” at the end was a nice touch, but I don’t think even someone like Trump would refer to something as “stupid”. It just sounds baby-ish.
1 This news just broke like 2 hours ago. Give it time.
2 "He denies it, he denies it, also he totally denies any doping." *shrugs shoulders*
4 "They totally deny it!"
3 I can already see all the people, including trump, asking why the ioc hasn't banned Hillary from competing.
1 I think it’s spelled barre....You’re a genius 
1 That's what the World Championships are for.The Olympics are about nations. And you punish nations when they misbehave as a whole. That's why they are allowing clean athletes to still compete, just not under the Russian flag.
0 I agree, the guy is clearly projecting about olympic drug abuse. How do you even come to that conclusion? Maybe he meant it as in "every country does it, so lets not celebrate till they are all banned". I mean, probably not but how about you try to not jump the gun and take every chance to start an argument online with people who probably cant handle your intense, over-analytic, annoying autism.
1 Historically, the US doped as much as Russia during the Cold War. Now? I don't know if it's state sponsored, but the vast majority of athletes at this level are on something.
1 Every elite sport would be shit if there isnt doping involved. Maybe with an exception for dart.
1 Jesus Christ, always with this whataboutism meme. People use this argument with everything but when it's concerning Russia it has a special word.Do you people not see the irony?
-3 Bringing up the fact that everyone does it does not necessarily mean that it's anything other than making sure that all facts are properly presented. Doesn't mean that anyone is trying to defend anything here. How is stating that "almost any other country cheats" dilute anything? Facts are facts. Mentioning other countries does not change the facts about Russian actions.
1 In my opinion, it's a serious problem with the internet comments. When someone says something bad about Russia, you can't, for any reason whatsoever, mention that the same practice exists elsewhere. People start screaming "whataboutism" and there is no hope of having any meaningful discussion. Was /u/TheMajora1 trying to defend Russia's actions? You don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. /u/Schiffy94 doesn't know, but he clearly does think so. Why do people instantly accuse /u/TheMajora1 of defending Russia when nothing in his post indicates that he is?
1 Very true! Also, I don't think it should matter at that point. Yes they were a militaristic regime with some strange ideas (which turned out to be devastating, but no one could have known the extent yet. Just that Adolf was a crazy fuck.), but the same could be said about a lot of regimes all around the world. The soviets are a good example of course. 
1 Does it matter? They could easily have taken the Olympics away from Germany after the Nazis came to power anyway but didn't.EDIT: Just looked it up, and in 1939, just three months before the start of World War II, the 1940 Winter Olympics were re-assigned to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.
1 They also were chosen for the 1940 Winter Olympics after Japan changed their mind thanks to the second Sino-Japanese War. So in 1939, 3 months before the invasion of Poland, Germany was given the Olympics, again. Also in 1939 Italy under Mussolini won the bid for 1944 Olympics. Though both were canceled when WWII started.
1 I mean yeah, Nazis are awful people.
3 Thank you, Worf, but we won't be raising shields right now.
1 Actually they are, I have more than once had replies from people where they basically called russians a mongoloid subrace of barbarians who are genetically and socially predisposed to evil deeds. But then again in their mind everyone who doesn't want to be like them is guilty of evil deeds. 
1 Oh come on, don't be so naive, so large, so visible organisation especially something so evidently prestigious for a country like Olympics simply doesn't exist without geopolitics. Heck it's been proven by Eurovision where the people in countries vote higher for countries they like rather than for better performances. It's why there have been talks of trying to take away the football thing away from Russia, after all everyone is pretty clear that russians won't win in football but the event is big and prestigious. 
1 Well he's completely ignoring the context of the post and using it as a soapbox to bitch about geopolitical issues that have nothing to do with the Olympics.  That's typical russian shill behavior, deflect the conversation AWAY from russia and onto the west. Nobody is going to listen to your opinion on abortion at your monthly book club either. 
1 Yes, I'm for real. The Nazis were causing problems for Jews in Germany before WWII, but the extent of what they were doing was not public knowledge in the Allied states until after the war had already started. The US didn't enter WWII to stop the Holocaust, they entered it because of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The American public had no idea what was going on in the concentration camps until much later, certainly not in 1936 when the Olympics were held in Germany.

-3 I...don't see where I said it was state sponsored? I just left the door open.  Why leave the door open?  Because there are powerful, and self-interest serving motivators for people not doing what they public claim is "right", and that is interesting.

2 Wasn't there a couple athletes who ended up competing for another country?
0 I think there were reasons, but yeah I agree with that.  Thought the report was released in Dec 2016?
1 lol "annexation"
1 I think annexation of Crimea was a mistake. But unfortunately I can see where it came from. When I was in Crimea in 2006 I was so astounded by the beauty of the place that I once jokingly said "Return, Crimea, bitches"Also we have quite popular 2000 criminal drama Brother 2, that has a scene were Russian gangster fights with Ukrainian gangsters and says a phrase "You will pay us for Crimea" [Or "we exact a revenge for Crimea" on you]So we kinda had it in our popular culture all along. That said. Crimea isn't really issue Russia was able to take over Crimea almost without bloodshed. And sanctions linked to Crimea are mild. The problem is Donbass. I don't know what's happened there, but it was quite different from what happened from Crimea. And even Donbass was ok untill M17H was brought down. That was basically when things turned really ugly. Now it looks like escalation spiral.Also why Russia considers Crimea Russian territory, it is considering Donbass Ukrainian territory.For me it looks like Russia wants Donbass back into Ukraine, but have no reasons to speed up that process until what is written in Minsk II agreement is implemented. It's kinda stalemate.Also Russia seems was really afraid of NATO base in Sebastopol, and overreacted. And really afraids of Ukraine in NATO and probably may overreact again if this becomes even remote possibility.Mostly it is seen as an agression from USA. USA left anti-ballistic missile treaty, and started deploying anti-missiles near Russian borders. Without MAD USA will have an overwhelming advantage over Russia. And if USA will have working anti-ballistic missile defence that would mean end of MAD.
1 Crimea was ok. I think Syria pissed off USA much more. And that election meddling thing with Trump winning was a cherry on top.
2 They won't be cherry after that. 
16 Nah, I don't know anybody who wants that. But we should continue to sanction the shit out of them and stop underestimating their war games, etc.
1 You heard it here first folks, boners or war, no in between! Thanks for clearing that up mate.
1 Canada **might** not be doing it, and that **might** is the point here, because we don't know. It's not about who does and who doesn't, it's about how to fix this issue and not just make an example out of Russia 
1 As someone who's super competitive I can't just accept that it's only Russia who cheats, simply because until recently russia was thought to be as clean as everyone else but now that they got caught they have been doing it since 70s. 
4 Very true, it's also very possible that they cheat in top of that
1 Source? 
1 Correct on the first part.There is no proof.Doesn't mean it didn't happen in the past.If you think US athletes aren't doping you're being naive.You unnecessarily exaggerated the *context being discussed*.
1 This could easily be retaliation for just that.
1 About?The US Olympic gymnast organization covered up sexual abuse for years.
1 Very true. Also, I guess we can't also just ignore the possibility of the selecting committee for the World Cup being bribed to choose Russia since there has been precedent of it having before as well as after the Russian selection. Although in my opinion Russia isn't the worst place in the world to hold the World Cup anyway so I guess that doesn't really bother me as much as case Qatar.
1 So what have you done, that got you in 'imprisoned upon arrival' list? I'm legitimately curious.
1 I don't think the Russians are the only ones guilty of doping by a long shot, but I do think it's reasonable that not every program treats doping as a state sponsored/mandated activity. 
1 No one has properly tried that's why. This investigation took fucking years. The definition of state sponsored is the government aiding your doping in some way be in financial or whatever correct? So if the USATF are funding the drugs or helping you to pass tests in anyway then that's sponsored correct? Which makes me ask you, do you seriously think the athletes are paying for it and have a team covering it up themselves? Please ask yourself that.
12 > Running by an American paper jeah right. I don't but I watching many documentaries about history. I question everything what others write.

1 And most of them have two way deals, so even if currently in the AHL, they have a two way with the NHL if they need to get called up because of active roster guys getting injured or whatever.I think the Olympics fall over scheduled college games too. It's just going to be weird...
1 Yeah, but that stuff is in flux on sometimes an hourly basis. No way they would be able to say whether someone would be on NHL contract 2 weeks in advance, let alone months.
1 I have been waiting years for an olympics to be created for athletes that want to dope. Then we can finally get real records shattered and make it exciting when a non doper is beating a doper in a sport.
1 Can confirm.
1 I thought anyone can go theyll just forfeit their pay for that period and will prob be in deep with their front office
1 Darn, Crosbys plan of getting demoted to go play was foiled. 
135 DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?
70 Some of the colleges play on Olympic sized ice. St cloud state for sure does. 
10 They definitely will. Finland and Sweden will be your gold and silver winners. The Canadians might still be able to put together a bronze contending team, but most likely it’ll be the Czechs or the Swiss or the Slovakians.
6 Until just now, I though the NCAA and the NAACP were the same thing. I had to look up what the NCAA was.    I don't watch college sports so I had no idea what the NCAA was.
1 For sure. There is a reason why Canada almost never won Olympic gold until the late 90's.
1 Same with here in Canada, some of the minor teams are incredibly good and don’t have NHL contracts. I think it’ll be interesting and if anything it’ll give players without contracts scouting opportunities. But countries with only a small hockey presence where their only good players are already in the NHL might be screwed
1 Miracle on Ice, dude. 
1 I️ feel like you were saying this just so somebody would bring up the 1980 team you sly dog.
1 There are plenty of North Americans playing in those leagues as well.  The US won't consist solely of college folk.
1 I mean there's a reason why Canada went 50 years without a medal. 
1 No worries, Canada still got this.
1 Czech hockey league is also very competetive, for example in the finals of last Champions Hockey league was a Czech team
1 yea man, I'm calling it, this is Finland's year.
1 No denying that but there is more then enough talent in the Canadian juniors to put up a gold medal team now
2 You and I know both know the World Juniors has been a more entertaining tournament for a long while now. Plus it's every year. 
2 It's not that awesome to watch unfortunately :/
1 It was that way until recently. They changed that rule and and pro's can now fight in the Olympics. Its insane. 
9 The third duck Movie coach would probably take over 
4 How is his leg doing? Last I heard it kept him from playing the kind of game he wanted. 
1 We've got nothing on ISLAND.
1 Nah, fuck the Ducks! Kesler can't even keep his clothes on.
1 Charlie is totally the right age to be their hockey coach now. 
0 inb4 sex abuse allegations against emilio
1 Hold tight Asznee!
1 I'm 27, that's not old at all
17 Yea I was just thinking both Sweden and Finland have their own leagues with plenty of talent.Congrats to both for the top two spots. Nothing gets the crowd riled up like an entire tournament playing for bronze amiriteguise
1 As if they needed it. 
1 Exactly! The professional players get seen year round. The Olympics is for me to pretend to care about a couple athletes for 1 week out of every 4 years and forget they spend their entire life preparing for these moments.
5 Saying banning the best players in the world from competing will somehow make it better is asinine. Use some goddamn common sense.
1 So is IKEA. Doesn't stop it from being big business.
1 http://www.businessinsider.com/olympics-inc-inside-the-business-of-the-ioc
64 So the IOC treats the NHL the same way bar and club owners used to treat my band when we went to play shows there."I can't pay you to play a gig but just think about the exposure you're getting!"Yeah no dude, I can go five miles down the road and get $200 per guy and free drinks, you can keep your free exposure.
7 They aren't allowed to even say they're NHL players. There has been no significant increase in viewers due to the Olympics. Remember it is a business. If they seen a significant increase in viewers to make it worth while then they'd go. Obviously they don't so they didn't go. 
18 [deleted]
3 They even tried that. The NHL can't promote them being in the Olympics, and the Olympics won't say they have the NHL. They get 0 exposure.
1 I mean, the NHL is plenty big though. I give 0 shits about sports and know what it is similar to knowing the NBA and NFL.
1 Because the players are under contract?
1 No kidding, do you have any idea how much the other sponsors doled out for that right? Probably twenty times as much as all of those aforementioned costs per Olympics, if not more. 
1 IOC doesn't pay those costs for any other sport, why is the NHL (not even hockey) special?
1 u/kokeshi_is_life is spot on in terms of the yearly world Championships.  As for a quadrennial tournament that hosts the very best in the sport?  Not really.  Organizers have been able to produce a few tournaments they coined The World Cup of Hockey, though the last one played last summer was a far cry from the previous efforts with the gimmicky way they picked the teams.  Besides that, the WCOH is sanctioned and organized by the NHL and NHLPA so players not employed by the league are left out.  While most of the best in the world play in the league, there are certainly guys playing in over-seas leagues that would make some teams more competitive too.  Even so, the tournament has only taken place three times since 1996
1 There is a IIHF world tournament, It takes place at the same time as the NHL playoffs and only pros from bad teams with nothing better to do are even eligible.  The whole thing is kind of a consolation prize joke so  lots of eligible NHL players don't even bother going 
1 The extra ad revenue of having the Olympics as the premiere international hockey tournament goes to the IOC instead of the NOCs thought, doesn't it? I'm honestly not really sure where the funding for NOCs comes from, is it distributed from the IOC or is it locally raised? 
4 it is on reddit, a site not coincidentally comprised of teenagers and naive college-age doofuses. they haven't learned how the world works yet  
2 they care about injuries BECAUSE of the money. If Sidney Crosby is injured during the Olympics and cannot return to the Pittsburgh Penguins then the owners of the Pittsburgh Penguins lose money because people aren't able to pay them to see Sidney Crosby.Also the NHL has guaranteed contracts, so the player gets paid regardless. In the event of an injury this would be covered by insurance but the owners pay the premiums.
1 For the Winter Olympics it's a fact. It has the highest ticket prices and is the most watched event. What do you think is the biggest event to generate revenue?
3 FIBA equivalent would be the IIHF World Championship.The NHL's quasi-international tournament was a third addition.
2 In terms of revenue though, the Olympics are hard for the NHL to pin down.  The NHL doesn't make money directly from the games.  The hope is that the Olympics increase interest in hockey and that in turn increases interest in the NHL.  If the NHL was getting revenue directly from those Olympic games then they would be far more inclined to participate.
2 A lot of people feel like that's the NHL's intent, but that's not what the NHL would claim.  They'd argue that one isn't directly related to the other, but whether or not you want to buy that is up to you.
1 ahh bummer 
1 Not fair at all! 
2 > That's fair, I was generalizing, But the Olympics bring professional hockey to world stage that just doesn't bring as much attention anywhere else.I definitely agree with you there.  It's hard to quantify how much Olympic hockey viewership actually contributes to making new NHL fans, which is unfortunate, but I think the Olympics does have the power to grow the game.
11 Those were kind of the only good things about it in my book. Team NA was incredibly fun to watch and I'd rather see Team Europe than Austria, Denmark, Germany and Latvia getting waxed. That said, it wasn't even close to the excitement of the Olympics, you could see it in the players' effort and the audience
1 Why? What actually made it bad? Like specifically. It was like the olympics except they replaced teams like Latvia and Slovakia who stood 0 chance of winning with actual competitive teams. 
1 Why? 
0 > Slap a jersey on of their home country and they’ll play their hearts out.Who can forget the country Europe, Or the great country North America U24
1 More like JeromeTheJERK!
-11 It shouldn’t be up to the NHL it should be up to the players, if you don’t want to risk getting hurt than don’t go, if you don’t care and want to represent your nation than you should be allowed to
3 If they are that angry, they can always retire from the NHL and then go play for whomever they wish. But something tells me their NHL paychecks will temper that anger a bit.
3 That makes more sense, I was confused on how the soccer thing worked out.That being said good lord I hope there is never an equivalent to FIFA for hockey.
1 I think soccer does that though, both for olympics and for the world cup? I could be wrong about that though not a big soccer fan.
1 Whoa bud I was just asking a question. Thank you for the information though, it was helpful.
2 I believe basketball does it. Let me check. It seems each country pays for insurance for its basketball players if it does. I believe France did it in 2016. http://nba.nbcsports.com/tag/nba-insurance
3 American football is not AFAIK, we're the only ones who play it. That's why the super bowl winners are referred to as "world" champions.
1 It is, but it's not that big. 
-2 Canada is just North USA. Not a real country tbh. Tough shit. 
0 >The IOC and sports are about generating entertainmentYou think when the first Olympics started in 1896 the goal was to create entertainment? You think the kids playing football at their local football club are trying to generate entertainment? HAHAHAHAHAHA That is just a ridiculous way to think. Sports and the IOC principle goal is not to create entertainment. Try to play some sports, so you could understand it. 
2 In hockey, European players value Olympic gold medals over everything, while north Americans put a Stanley cup above the gold medal. Team strength doesn't matter, it's that you're representing the country you grew up in and all your friends, family, and nieghbors over just yourself. 
1 Exactly. So those particular teams are greedy is what you are saying?
1 True.  And I didn’t really mean to comment on the NHLs practices, since I am not that familiar with them.  Just meant to say that one organization being corrupt does not mean another cannot be
-2 That's a nice way to think about an athlete with dreams and goals. "An investment"
2 Thank you for proving my point that the NHL is the goal of hockey players, not the olympics 
1 This is true but crosby stamkos and mcdavid are arguably the 3 best you have so they would probably have had their own lines to drive, being that the chemistry worked out, and you would have guys like Bergeron taking draws but moving back to the wing.
1 I'm assuming guys who play for Canada in the Spangler Cup are prominently khl guys? Because that's my guess as to what the team might look like,minus the few guys that would join after not making/getting knocked out the NHL playoffs
1 > "do it for love of country"While the organizers accept the lowest bids to build the needed infrastructure and don't pay the athletes or even provide adequate services (anyone remember Rio?) while the people in charge get huge contracts that provide zero resources to the community as soon as the games are over and the tourist are gone. Not that the locals make any money anyway since they spend so much just to get the games to their city in the first place. Just look at the list of demands the IOC members make in order for your city to get the games: https://mises.org/blog/olympics-biggest-corporatist-sports-scam-allThe modern Olympic games is a sports entertainment business out to make as much money as possible like any other, nothing more majestic than FIFA, NBA, NHL or anything else. 
24 But he didn't, he got hurt in the Olympics.
1 There's also all the negotiations with the ioc that took part. The location of the Olympics and many other things. If it was just your reason the NHL would never play in the Olympics which they did. 
9 Not the worst ever. It was poorly put together, yeah, but most of the top talent was still there (except for American talent, but that's a different story) and it was still a blast to watch.
6  How was it the worst ever? You still had the best teams go up against the best teams, it is literally no different than the Olympics. There is no point in having Germany in it because they'll lose to Canada and the other big teams 8-1 anyway. And there isn't enough countries playing at a high enough calibre like the Fifa World Cup to have a 32 team month long tournament. Canada vs Kazakhstan would be like a 30-0 thrashing. Canada, US, Finland, Russia, Sweden, the Swiss to an extent, and the Czech are the only teams good enough to be reasonably competitive with one another. No one would be interested in or even watch Australia vs France. Neither nation gives a shit about hockey and the game would be dull, OHL teams would beat them. As for the gimmick teams you can't say they weren't fun to watch especially the NA team. Mcdavid and Matthews on the same team, you'll never see that ever again. They were a young, very skilled, and very fast team. They were the most exciting team to watch out of all the teams participating.    
3 Maybe the worst tournament ever in terms of meaning, but those teams, especially the north American team, were a blast to watch.
3 That was the best non-Olympic hockey tournament there has basically ever been. It was the best players in the world, and it was very fun. The 2 "gimmick" teams just made the tournament even more competitive 
5 They were marketing it last time around and it sounded so cool. Then I looked up what the actually tournament was and was so disappointed.
3 Hockey has the World Championships. World Cup of Hockey is just an NHL exhibition. 
1 Well, there is the IIHF World Cup as well... in my mind the ‘real WC of hockey’, though still not perfect (given conflict with NHL playoffs)
1 It doesn't suck though. Same teams went, the same top teams were the only good ones to watch, same players made up the same teams. It was still best of the best. And Sweden vs NA was far more exciting then Sweden destroying Germany. The only thing that is different is it doesn't have the glamour of the Olympics and if that is all you care about then you're watching for the wrong reasons. 
10 There is but its awful. It's sponsored by the NHL so only their players are allowed to play and its basically a glorified All-Star tournament where the players half-ass it because they don't care. Not even the fans really care, they struggled to get people to show up when it was hosted in Toronto, the biggest hockey market in the world
1 It isn't terrible. You just have salty fans who seem to care more about the glamour of the Olympics than hockey itself. Most players that make up the Olympic teams all come from the NHL anyway. All the players on Canada, US teams are all from the NHL. Sweden and Finland may only have a couple that aren't in the NHL and that is it. There are really only 6 good countries that can play top tier hockey and 99% of those players are in the NHL anyway. You still have the best of the best and it is still exciting to watch. People are just salty.
1 Why would South America take it more seriously than Europe? 
2 That's the world championship. Not world cup.
1 Exactly. So just like olympic soccer/football has age as a limiting factor, so olympic hockey has no NHL player pool as a limiting factor. Both can still be enjoyable, though definitely not the quality competitions we would hope them to be.
1 Hmmm. I'm not sure I understand.
5 Nobody takes Olympic soccer seriously other than the worst teams. It's a glorified friendly youth tournament. You don't even get the best u-23 players since clubs don't need to release their players for it. 
5 > Soccer in the olympics is more interesting than the world cup typically though.Yeah that's why it attracts so many more viewers than the World Cup does.
1 [List of Winter olympic sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games#Current_sports) Most sports on that list don't have household athlete names associated. Indicating those people don't make huge money for sponsorship. Maybe you can dig into the few dozen people in womens luge and tell us the household names, or maybe ski jump?There is some money there but is it enough to live off for all the people who qualify, in most cases no. Nice try though /s actually it was a rather shitty try
3 Good call! No one even comes close in the maple syrup game! And all dressed chips. Damn those things are good.
2 It depends how much you enjoy the sport. I think the World Junior Championships are the funnest games you can watch aside from the Cup playoffs. Sometimes less than perfect hockey is more exciting.
1 Try going to a college game and see for yourself.
9 > I feel like without the NHL (and KHL if they don't join) the olympics is essentially just the Spengler Cup The Spengler Cup also has KHL players too, so in that regard we could see a sub-Spengler Cup roster from Team Canada in the Olympics.
1 > The minor leagues players can go to the olympics this year, but only if they have a contract with the minors and not one with the major but are only in the minors for whatever reason. I understand that, that's why I added the "players tethered to an NHL club" qualifier.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  But yes, players on AHL-only contracts are eligible, those on two-way contracts are not.
0 Team Canada was going to feature a lot of players from the KHL, but now that might not be practical.  As for AHL players, those on two-way contracts can't participate, only those on AHL-only contracts, so the pool of eligible minor league players aren't great.Players in other European leagues are an option though.
1 No question but I believe my point that exciting tournaments can arise from non-optimal talent pools stands.The AHL and menagerie of Canadian and Eurasian professional leagues will send their talent and it will still be exciting to watch without the NHL participating.
1 i'm excited for the changes to the men's, because it will be a better tournament.i'm excited specifically for the Canada-US game, because it's my favourite game of hockey to watch, and it only comes every 4 years. the tournament is, unfortunately lacking.
168 We all did. Watching athletes on PEDs is incredible and we do pretty much every sporting event we watch.
10 Now we just get to watch Sammy Sosa slowly turn white. https://i.imgur.com/6Yhv03f.jpg
2 Oh I loved it. It was so exciting.

0 I wish PEDs were allowed in sports or at least encouraged
313 It would be fun to try to bet what they’re on while they’re racing. “Oh, that guy just completely left the track. Whoever bet on LSD is probably getting a big payout”
1 The teams aren't based on locations but instead chemicals.  The cocaine and meth teams are doing great but keep dying from exploding hearts.
1 You should watch the tour de pharmacy on hbo. Its a fake sports documentary about the tour de france with Andy Samberg. 
5 Vision quest bro beans!
6 I don't want to participate but I wouldn't mind training with these athletes. 
3  Bill Burr has a joke about that.
3 "Aw shucks, I drew Cheetah blood"
3 You should check out the old, but great Saturday Night Live short skit “All Drug Olympics”. Pretty appropriate, even 30 years later. If the link below doesn’t work, just Google it. https://www.hulu.com/watch/4090
2 Ah yes ! And with some US wrestling level scripting and drama. That would be awesome
2 It would be cool to see certain sports with any advantages allowed. Imagine a football game, but one side is jacked beyond belief and has drones using computer vision to direct their movements, and the other side is using exoskeletons that can throw a ball to within an inch of another exoskeleton. The arms race would be insane.People would probably die tho so maybe not
1 it would be like the formula 1. instead of countries it would be teams with different pharmaceutical sponsors
1 I think there's a documentary on Netflix about this. Icarus springs to mind. It's definitely worth watching  if you're interested in learning about Russia and doping.
1 Tour de Pharmacy
1 It would be good if it had a 2-class system, like endurance motorsports (i.e.: Le Mans 24 hours). Basically, you have Category A, the people who are all doping, within certain limits, and then those in Category B, who choose not to dope. They all race the same races, but even if you finish 24th, if you're 1st in your Category, you're that Category's champ.You could still choose not to do long-term damage to your body and not do steroids, and *still* win among your peers.
1 That was an amazing episode, though. I'll watch it with you. Bring pizza, I got liquor. 
1 Simplify it a bit but still base it on that episode of BMS. You’re trying to win the Tour de France but you start with a pound of marijuana. Your time is submitted if you’ve completed the race and smoked the whole bag. 
1 The Tour de France already is. It's comical we think that it isn't. It's riddled with doping. 
1 https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4mzgmt/the_drug_olympics/
1 > However, you wouldn't know what you were getting, you just had to stick that hand of yours into a bowl and take whatever you grabbed."We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls."
1 I would love to see drug olympics. Everyone roided out, everything is fair game. I would like to see what monstrosity is possible to create when humans are not given any limits. 
1 This is why the cars in NASCAR have governors on them.
1 Could we just do that, like... without all the work of the bike ride? 
1 I’d actually like to see a separate sporting event to the Olympics where performance enhancing drugs are not only legal but highly encouraged.It would be a win for many:* Pharmaceuticals get to test all kinds of performance enhancing substances on athletes without the pressure of having to elude drug tests or fear of any reprisal. The successful drugs could then be resold for profit to benefit the consumer. The event itself would be a great vehicle to advertise these substances too.* Science would benefit because the research and development of performance enhancing substances could be quicker and more convenient than the years of clinical trials that new drugs have to go through. This could lead to potential scientific breakthroughs in multiple areas.* Spectators get to see science push the human body far beyond its limits, which will make many sports more entertaining to watch.* Athletes who were recently banned for doping get a fresh start in a league perfectly suited for them.
1 Watch the HBO shortmovie "Tour de Pharmacy" and have your wish be granted.
1 I always pushed for 'Barry Bonds League' baseball.  I didn't push it to the right people though because sounds like I'm not the only one who would be down.
1 [SNL](https://view.yahoo.com/show/saturday-night-live/clip/4973328/weekend-update-all-drug-olympics) did it.
1 I've always favored the idea of a doping friendly sport...or at least a doping friendly division within the sport.It would be great to have team 'scientists' competing to come up with the best shit to make their athlete(s) perform the best. 
-9 That's really the problem though isn't it? Shitheads like you will continue to support sports even when you know they are cheating. 
7 Check out bodybuilding
2 I'd like to have both quite honestly, and separated. See what the finest can do naturally which is still impressive. Then have a games for consenting adults to push their bodies with things like HGH. 
2 Why stop with the human body, I bet you could train animals to compete extremely well
100 Lol imagine synchronized swimming
45 I want an Olympic event with an average person in every category to see how much better the elite athletes are.
6 Oh, you wanted figure skating? Sorry, you're doing the luge!
1 Training for years to be a weight-lifter and you get floor routine. Great.Next up for Judo: Nancy Kerrigan!!
3 Some of the events could legitimately result in deaths. Most of the Winter mountain events like skiing, luge & bobsledding, ski jumping. One of the trained luge guys did die in a crash during the 2010 Olympics. 
1 They should just do this for charities or something. Would be amazing.
1 Well, there's the decathlon. They run short, mid, and long distances as well as with hurdles. They jump high and long, vault with poles, throw the discus and the javelin, as well as put shot. One can certainly imagine a variant where you throw swimming, gymnastics, or perhaps archery in there, but I mean... It's already kind of an übermensch competition, where athletes strive to be as well-rounded as possible.
1 All athletes must participate in all events in a single category. There are 3 categories:- Judged events (Figure Skating, Trick Snowboarding, etc)- Timed events (speed skating, Downhill events)- Team sports (Ice Hockey, Curling, Bobsled)Maybe they cull some of the dangerous events like ski jumping....
1 Not quite that extreme, but for the equestrian portion of the pentathlon, they find out 5 minutes before their ride who their horse will be. It's hilarious to watch. SO. MANY. FALLS.
1 I didn't know I wanted this til now
33 True, then the athletes could be sponsored by big medical companies.
1 Problem is the athletes would die. There was a survey in the, IIRC, seventies where athletes were given the choice:1) Win everything this year2) [edit] **But** die next yearSomething like 70+ percent said yes...
5 It has my friend. It already is happening.
1 The illusion of legitimacy is what sells
1 Alot of the compounds are illegal in a lot of countries though... lots of countries would have massive advantages.
1 Hunger Games 0.5
1 Google it NAO
1 Yeah, at that point might as well organize a [Battle Royale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0p1t-dC7Ko) instead.
1 That's almost every sport. Winners are only cheaters if they're caught.
1 Sounds a lot like the plot of *[Battle Royale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0p1t-dC7Ko)*.
14 Main difference is individual athletes that might be doping vs a state-sponsored doping system. Which is the reason a whole nation was banned and not just individuals
1 Is it a documentary? 
1 ...and the regular Olympics would be half as entertaining and exciting as the steroid Olympics. As audiences gravitate toward the steroid Olympics, sponsors would soon drop support for the regular Olympics and the steroid Olympics would become... The Olympics. It's complete horseshit anyway. PEDs are everywhere in athletics at that level and many athletes know exactly how to use them and avoid detection. It's perfectly ok to use the latest and best technology, the best supplements (legal and WADA approved), bleeding edge nutrition, hundreds of thousands of dollars in training, the best sports medicine doctors, physiotherapists, coaches, etc. and yet drugs that assist in recovery and performance is where we draw the line? It's fucking stupid. What happens when nanotechnology in the form of injectable nanobots becomes a thing? Will they ban that too? People (and their bureaucratic representatives) need to get over this and accept reality.
29 But no dude boners.
1 That's what you get for staying up past your bedtime.
1 Bear wrasslin'
16 There is no evidence that the Russian gymnasts cheated or doped then. They boycotted that Olympics for political reasons, they weren't banned from it. There is some speculation from people who came forward 30 years later who think the russian track and field athletes may have been doping, and when the olympics said they would be creating stricter anti-doping regulations that may have been a factor in Russia's decision  to boycott the games. But there's no evidence I've heard of to believe the women competing in the friendship games gymnastics were cheating in any way.
1 Did the Soviets cheat?
1 There were more countries than just the Soviet Union.
1 Yeah that makes sense. I don't know why there'd be a state sponsored effort to cheat at the olympics anyway. Seems like a petty thing to pursue.
-5 Greece is not a shit show though. Has seen better days but not a shitshow. Britain is bigger shitshow.
1 In all seriousness Russia is way better than the US about assassinating anyone who might oppose Putin's near-dictatorship.
2 Better vodka, more bears, atc.
0 > superior persecution of gays and political outsidersOh so you're an Islamic State then? Here I thought Russians had actual pride and merit.
1 Well god damn it, I just defected. I guess I'm going back.
13 It's not even close. There is no place in America that approaches the level of hell that is Chechnya. And the kind of corruption under investigation in the United States would be one of the most upstanding of Russian political careers. The United States is in a shitty situation, but anyone saying it's as bad or worse than what's going on in Russia has a serious misunderstanding of one of those two countries.
3 I mean they're both shit. I don't think comparing the two actually helps with anything.
3 Yeah, in the USA our government corruption isn’t even done competently.  
1 And from my perspective as an American who has finally decided that maybe Putin isn't the best guy, that's what I fear. I feel he's unethical and has backwards views, but the Russian people apparently support him for it ("Putin strong leader, keep country stable, better than before") and there isn't strong opposition to keep him or his administration in check, and that's probably not going to change. Maybe low oil prices might hurt Putin, but oil prices probably won't remain low indefinitely, and external sanctions are basically outside-imposed protectionism, which helps him with working-class labor interests.
1 Sure it is. A person, animal or object (in this case a sentence) regarded as embodying a quality, concept or thing. That sentence embodies the concept of Russian.

1 > you oppress queers by doing what the people want you toQueer people are people. That’s why this is “evil” regardless of what the majority wants. Your comment does make it clear why Putin might be popular with a majority of the people, I’m not arguing that.
1 You still can't openly criticize Putin though, right? Pussy Riot was jailed for doing that if I recall correctly.

1 You could say the same things about Americans.
1 It's crazy that a ton of Americans actually think like that
1 You were the one who said "hate", not me. Those in Latin America, the Middle East look/looked to Russia because of bullying from the US and wanted someone to use to help even the score. The Chinese trust Russia no more than they do anyone else; the Sino-Soviet split was a long time ago. Maduro in Venezuela needs more loans from Russia, Assad in Syria needs Russia to be protect him, that's about it.
1 Yeah, unfortunately most Americans can't think outside of their own worldview. The USA has been at odds with Russia since the end of WWII, so our position on this is obviously going to be very different than that of other countries (especially those that have been mostly free of Russia's political interference).
1 Pretty much this. However it's a really common mentality that West = World. I highly doubt that countries that got bombed by Nato or invaded by USA hate Russia and are instead quiet fond of it, compared to, for example, western countries. Also, this mentality that propaganda only exists in Russia and China are really weird, we are all experiencing propaganda from time to time, we swallow every story that gets published here (not talking about this one).EDIT: For people downvoting me, tell me again, what countries hate Russia outside of us western ones? I'm just taking a middle ground here and seeing things objectively. Do you seriously believe that middle east hates Russia? Southern Europe (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro)? Belarus? Turkey?Brazil, China, India - superpowers (BRIC)? Whole Asia, Africa and South America?I mean, come on.
1 > whataboutismThis has been used there since the advent of Communism. It's their favorite tactic.

1 That’s always my retort – yeah, it’s fucked up when the US does it too. Just because it happens doesn’t make it okay.

1 I mean, isn't that also because of Putin? If someone really tried to make a push to defeat him and not be a clown while doing it, they have a good chance of ending up dead.
22 They know. They like it. Putin embodies "what a leader should be," to most Russians.

19 And let's not pretend like we forgot Obama gave Manning clemency. 
69 But then how can we make everything about how evil and terrible America is.
-4 The end result is the same on society - their message and ability to participate/contribute is removed. I don't think a country should get a pass because it "imprisons forever" instead of just kills someone.

37 Also, because unlike most Russian whistleblowers, Snowden acted ~~in the interests of~~ in a way that doesn't harm and may have slightly helped the Russian government.
2 Likely something else. Treason is a really hard thing to charge someone with.
4 Yes, for informing the previously unaware stupid public that we were all being spied on 24 hours a day. What a crime. Right and left wing are both guilty. If it came out Russia was doing that (and I’m sure they are) we’d all be like “wow what a horrible dystopian country”. But it’s the US so nah I guess 
-3 And then commit suicide by repeatedly shooting himself in the back of the head 
-8 ...the penalty for which is death. Reminds me of the scarecrow scene from the TDKR
-3 Which is punishable by... you guessed it... death.
-1 Well treason is punished with death so.....
-1 He's trying to say that being locked in solitary confinement for the rest of your life without legal counsel isn't far off death; I dare say I agree.
2 That isn't what he is saying. The point is that both Russia and the US (as well as just about every country on Earth) punitively mistreat whistleblowers, so it seems hypocritical to highlight Russia's human rights violations when we do the same or similar things. 
1 What I’m trying to say has been covered in the discussion that continued in regards to my last post. Americans on Reddit will take any chance to shit on Russia meanwhile they have just as bad if not worse record of human right violations. How many journalists in Latin America have been executed with the help of US funding, training and support of the puppet regimes throughout Latin America and the rest of the world ? 
0 >Are you trying to say that Russia doesn't have a horrible well deserved reputation for killing whistleblowers and journalists?Specify where he said that? You are just creating strawmen out of of thin air now. Pathetic. 
3 Methinks you don't realize just how bad solitary confinement is
1 You have NOT BEEN IN SOLITARY THENIt is hell. 
-1 Russia doesn't officially has death sentence. USA does. When Snowden still was at airport USA was asked to provide assurances that Snowden wouldn't get a death sentence nothing of sort were provided and it was one of the reasons why Russia couldn't send Snowden off to USA.
-1 Hard choice. 40 years of solitary in a tiny plain grey room with nothing but your thoughts, where you can't even suicide. Or 2 months of radiation poisoning until your guts fall apart. Either way, I'd wish I went the other by the end. I think the rational choice is take the polonium and then find some morphene to end things sooner.
-2 She was sentenced to 35 years but Barack Obama commuted her to 7 years. Great for her :)

44 Oh, believe me, their propaganda machine is world class. It is consistent with all of the conspiracy theories. They have laid out a very sophisticated puzzle where all the pieces fit perfectly. Russians generally don't seek information outside of the state channels, so they don't know anything else. Extremely poor English skills don't allow them to. They are never exposed to English (except for American pop and rock), and English in elementary schools is sub par at best. My wife was a child prodigy. She won a national chess competition after playing chess for 4 months. When she was 15. Against adults and other teens. She swallowed the propaganda, hook line and sinker.
7 It's not willful ignorance, to these people it is the truth.Imagine if North Korea really was a paradise for the proletariat, if the world governments really were run by the Rothschilds, and if the moon landing really was faked. Imagine if absolute evidence that proved beyond all shadow of doubt that these things were true, it would turn your entire understanding of the world on its head. There's no knowing just how much of what you know to be true is a lie, so most people with doubts suppress them in order to maintain their own sanity and peace of mind. 
6 I'm no fan of conspiracies, but your response has no grasp on reality in and of itself.  The imperfection that is humans is part of you too.
1 That post you replied to.  That person is probably a "democrat".  Most of America is convinced Russia is super evil because of propaganda.  
1 Well, I think they meant in the propaganda sense. But I could totally see Trump being manipulated into allowing that if we didn't have liberals to defend their rights.
0 The US government doesn't have one.The United States as a whole produces an awful lot of news from a US perspective and full of pro-US biases. The BBC is much more of a propaganda machine than anything the US has. I'm not saying that US news sources are flawlessly impartial, I'm asserting that there is no machine rather than there being no propaganda.
8 Why wouldn't you be afraid of Trump?I don't like what I see in Russia. At all. I am scared that's where we're headed.
1 Well those other countries never funded their athletes. For example, South Sudan is home to a couple Olympians who compete under the Olympic flag. Their government has nothing to spare to fund them, so who pays for independent athletes?
38 Right, but we can only do what we can do.
8 to be fair, he did fail a test. They then retroactively wrote a TUE and paid the UCI a fee to have it forgotten (sorry a charitably donation that had nothing to do with it)
1 From the article:>In barring Russia’s team, Olympic officials left the door open for some Russian athletes. Those with histories of rigorous drug testing may petition for permission to compete in neutral uniforms. A panel appointed by the International Olympic Committee will rule on each athlete’s eligibility.I'm guessing they are going to be looking at any Russian athletes participating *extremely* closely. They were testing clean because Russia had literally infiltrated the labs doing the testing. Those medals are being taken back now and you can bet your ass none of them will be the ones competing in 2018.
2 But these athletes are right now being tested by not-russian laboratories just so they can compete. With that all the tests are being kept in freezers for a long time. Just recently we had a case in my country (Slovenia) where a biathlon (cross country skiing) athlete was positive for doping in a sample from 2010 olympics in Vancouver 
66 If it was that easy, don’t you think Russia would’ve done it for the last Olympics instead of all the shame they went through?

3 This is the kind of thing that the Russians are going to say. "We were banned for not bribing the testers, like everyone else does."
1 Individual athletes likely wouldn't have the sway or money to bribe the testers - not like Russia would.
1 It sounds like you have to have a history of rigorous drug testing. It's not one test you have to pass or something you could start now.
1 If it were really that simple, why wouldn't Russia just bribe the IOC?
1 That goes the same for every country that has won a war. I'm talking about nationalistic in other regards, like people are discussing in the thread.

1 I'm sure the rates would be amazing on that bet, too bad you'd probably wouldn't live to see the day to receive the payout.
9 That's how I feel as well. However, I also think that it's rather unfortunate that the actions we associate to a country are caused by a small group of people. From Mexico's government we can draw some of the biggest pieces of shit to roam this world, whose effort to solve the country's problems is next to nil, even though we have the resources to resources needed to grow into a respectable economic power. But when it comes to the vast majority of the population, although there's a good share of pieces of shit, there's a large part I'd feel proud representing.
4 People are proud of what there country represents as a whole and what it has accomplished. If you have a problem with national pride, don't go telling other people that they shouldn't be proud. 
4 See I don't understand why everyone sees country and state as the same thing.I don't care much for my government but I sure as hell love the people and the land. 
2 They were banned for doping... it is pretty much an open secret that most elite level athletes are doping. Not just the Olympics, it is everywhere. Ever since  we figured out Genetics do not beat drugs. Drugs have played a key part in determining the winner in pretty much everything. I don't care that Russia is banned. I care that their athletes have to prove they are clean to compete under a neutral flag. Let them compete under a neutral flag without having to prove it. Let them be subject to the same testing as everyone else... unless current testing is totally inadequate and the whole thing is a farce anyway and everyone is doping.
2 The NHL drug testing program doesn't seem very robust and should be easy to get around. You wouldnt even need to get fancy with microdosing with how infrequently they test.
2 Which is why I said in this case, the NHL already pulled out of the Olympics, though what you are saying is of course 100% correct. 
1 >  rest of Europe has grown What do you mean by grown? GDP has grown? Progress has been made on social issues you care about? They've conquered land and increased their territory? 
1 The gap has widened since Putin took over, Russia's economy and population haven't grown while the US is still growing. 
1 I think you're underestimating the effect that's Trump's administration is having on American people. I'm not talking policy, I'm talking about the doubt that has been sown into the populace—widening the partisan divide. What happens when Meuller is fired? What happens when Congress ultimately decides to forgive Trump of his collusion? What if Trump is impeached, and goes down with a message to "fight back"? I think this mess gets worse before it gets better.
1 Yes trump’s made a big impact in the news but not in our actual lives I know people who love and hate trump but they all act the same. We are definitely not “destabilized”.
1 I agree with what you're saying but media hype really does have a way of permeating people's judgement with fear and anger. Even if there wasn't a single attack, it would be easy to get some folks whipped up in a frenzy against the immigrants which subtracts from overall stability in my opinion. 
1 >booming1.9% Gdp growth... Wew
1 She lost but she reached record popularity. Germany has AfD which has been also on the rise. They don't have majority but the people are sending clear message. In my country we got SPD with over 10% votes based mostly on hating EU and being strongly against immigrants and Islam in general. Pure populists with political businessman as leader.All of these are making harder for Europe to work contructively on future development and instead focus on cheap bitching and calls to separate which makes Putin happy, of course.
2 Ah interesting point. My next question? Would the price of oil have dropped regardless of Russia and sanctions? Basically, I'm wondering if they would have been screwed either way with that. My guess is it would be impossible to tell, because of the complex nature of what sets oil prices. But you might have a better answer for that. 
1 /s?
1 Maybe with a different head of state, and an impervious missile shield then yes, Russia would get democracy'd.
5 [146% chance](http://gawker.com/5864945/putin-clings-to-victory-as-russias-voter-turnout-exceeds-146) that they will be a sham. Still the opposition (I guess mostly Navalny's followers) is still pretty active and are actually running a country-wide campaign. Of course Navalny won't be allowed to participate in elections, still Putin will want to do some kind of damage control...
5 [Putin does appear to be genuinely popular in  Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/24/why-we-should-be-confident-that-putin-is-genuinely-popular-in-russia/?sw_bypass=true&utm_term=.55169abaa7a2).The elections will still be unfair, sure, but that doesn't mean Putin would lose a fair election.
1 I was just thinking “russia has elections”? But I guess only kind of.
1 What's even sadder (or funnier?) is that many (if not most) of its users are Russian expats living in US, Canada or EU.

1 Fine. Then the same goes for movies, music, video games, art, and anything else you might consider to be fun and remotely enjoyable.
1 I immigrated with my parents in the late 90s to the US. I was too little to remember the fall of the USSR, but mom and dad have always said that the time was filled with incredible optimism. At that point, apart from getting married and having a kid, it was the best time in their lives. People really believed things would get better for about 2-3 years. Reality set in by 94-95 and we were out of that shit hole in 98. 
1 > why they emigratedThey didnt like Putin.> highest-everSignificantly lower that before the war.
-1 you have a lot to learn if you think that's the kind of shit world leaders get involved in. putin does not make every single non-civilian decision.
2 Oh he is popular no doubt but that doesn't mean he has been good, especially with how Russian media is manipulated.You don't have to cosy up to the West to not murder people or invade other countries. 
1 You know what? You're right. Technically the US is partially responsible for helping arm the rebels fighting Assad. But in **no way** is arming rebels to fight a dictator morally equivalent to arming/propping up said dictator. It's insane to even imply the two actions are equivalent. 
2 Nah, he would say "low IQ".
1 World Championships of what, exactly?If the Olympics are about nations then who gets to keep the medals?If the Olympics are about the nations then why does it matter that a player dopes? Players are allowed to have better gear than others.
1 What about chess? I've seen some doping in my time!
1 "you people" lol
1 People using whataboutism doesn't increase the validity of whataboutism.
1 That's how the tactic works. It's similar to concern trolling. You change the topic at hand (Russia getting caught cheating) to a different one (hey all countries cheat but I'm not gonna provide evidence) in order to distract. It seems genuine and might be, but it's a tried and true way of getting the heat off. Other examples of this include Trump bringing up Clinton when Mueller's investigation is mentioned or African dictators bringing up the corruption of the west when called out for evil acts. It doesn't help any situation, it just serves to give a "well all sides are bad so whatever" response of apathy moving forward.
1 Because that's what "whataboutism" is. It has its own word and is often specifically related to Russia because we have tons of evidence of huge digital propaganda campaigns from russia flooding message boards. So because of their own actions, people are skeptical of comments defending Russia. Seems reasonable to me.
1 In my opinion, Reddit admins need to take a much stronger stand on the paid bots and trolls that immediately descend like evil locusts on every single thread that says something negative about Putin or Russia. And anyone in this thread who is an actual human user who thinks it's morally ok to work for Putin in this way should go fuck themselves with a cactus.
1 >Yes, I'm for real.Oh, okay, then you're just flat wrong and not worth time.
2 I think they have there freedom eagle blinders on. It’s like they didn’t read your comments. 
3 Ok, apples and bananas then.One country has a dedicated operation with resources and agencies involved that can only happen by direction from the very top, that is to say, old murderous polonium putin.The other country undoubtedly has a few athletes doping on their own, without national support, rather, only with the support of their small teams. These two countries are totally the same amirite?Like I said, americas actions would be comparable to russias if there was a dedicated operation involving tons of governmental resources, that could only happen if directed from the very top.  A cheating individual is nowhere near comparable to an organized cheating country.
4 The report was published in two parts, one part before Rio and one part after.
1 I can say USA definitely cares more about Syria. Actually, my Russian friends believe that USA makes the whole thing up about Russian involvement in ANYTHING USA related just as USA propaganda to make Russia look bad and also provide an excuse to get rid of Trump. I did tell them I believe they're being somewhat biased, where they need absolute published proof from the FBI that Russia tampered with the election but don't need proof at all to say that the Olympics are punishing Russia for Crimea. And that Trump's son and political advisory team admitting guilt is not proof, and that the whistleblower doctor from Russia is also not proof.Also, they say Crimea and not Syria because they believe that this punishment is coming from the whole world, not USA.
1 Alright man. You have your opinions, I have mine. Have a good day. 
1 Nobody ever thought the Russians were clean dude. They've always been known as cheaters. 
1 It's in Russian. On rbc.ru Can't really find it now. But there is statement from Kadyrov that Chechens sportsmen aren't going
-1 You said they'll be going. Got a source?
1 Start investigating then. Its a big deal to you, get on it!
1 > You unnecessarily exaggerated the context being discussed.I didn't exaggerate it. This whole entire news article is on a country-wide program. That's not an exaggeration. Russia has an organization doing it. >There is no proof. Doesn't mean it didn't happen in the past.Sure, I'm willing to admit that it's possible. How likely is it? I'm not sure as I don't follow the Olympics that closely. >If you think US athletes aren't doping you're being naive.Yeah sure I'm willing to bet some are, and I'm willing to bet even the government might know about it, but choosing to turn a blind eye. There's still no proof that USA has a program headed by a doctor with a team of CIA agents whose jobs are to come up with a way to dope every athlete and sneak them through testing.Is it possible? Yes, of course. Is it likely? I don't know I'm not an expert. Is it true? I don't know, and you don't know, so when you say "USA has been doing it forever." I expect you to back that statement up with any sort of evidence.
1 I would agree with that. It's when people say it's just the Russians who so corrupt to state sponsor it Tha makes me laugh. Go back to when this was first coming out, the amount of athletes that said their national coaches were offering them or suggesting they should dope was truly revealing. 
1 > No one has properly tried that's why. This investigation took fucking years.Ok, so you think we should ban the US Olympic team based on your hunch? What? And why don't you think there has been investigations? You do know the Russian doping program was originally uncovered by a German news organization, right? I guarantee virtually every other country in the world would like to see USA out of the picture as well. Why hasn't anyone turned up a similar program? You seem to be underestimating how extensive Russia's program was/is. It wasn't simply coaches pushing drugs on athletes, but an expectation that the regulatory bodies would falsify data and look the other way. Athletes would regularly pay a large percentage of their earnings in exchange for immunity. Russia has a long, well documented history of doping in the Olympics, and frankly cannot be trusted to play fairly and all of their athletes should be treated with suspicion. The same is not true of the US. Russia has been caught cheating far more than any other country. They've had something like 50 medals stripped from them for cheating out of a total 150. Russia makes up a 1/3rd! America has only had 8 medals stripped. Read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_Russia#2018_Winter_Olympics_ban) article for brief overview.> So if the USATF are funding the drugs or helping you to pass tests in anyway then that's sponsored correct? Is USATF as a whole helping people cheat? Source? If a coach or an athlete sponsored by the USATF cheat doesn't implicate the rest of the athletes. When it's been revealed the anti-doping organizations themselves are in on the cheating then we can look at all American athletes with suspicion as well.
1 Well get on it man, its a big concern to you, no ones stopping you from investigating.
1 Hahaha. Sanctions are an alternative to starting World War III. I already pointed out that you answered your own question, don't get pissy just because you didn't mention them in your original post. Idiot.
35 It would be more fun if NHL players could participate though. The games in Sochi and Vancouver were some of the most exciting hockey the world has ever seen. It's a shame they can't get a deal worked out.
1 That would be a disaster for drug use in youth athletics.
5 The IIHF isn't letting anyone on a NHL contract to go. 
6 What a magical time to be alive and watching hockey.
1 YES!!!
1 I've paid my dews...
35 Some colleges are already full of Olympians. During a year at the University of Minnesota Duluth, the women's team had gold, silver and bronze medalists. We just cheered for everyone.
2 Princeton also does.
2 Go Huskies!
2 Olympic is bigger than NHL?
-10 Doesn't matter, they would get shit on by some European teams.
11 I don’t think it’s as clear cut as saying Finland and Sweden are guaranteed gold and silver. Canada and I’d assume the States as well, have ample amounts of players that are talented enough to make up a gold medal team. And remember, some of Finland’s and Sweden’s best players are also in the NHL, so they won’t be able to participate. 
6 Finns lose most of the team if  KHL pulls out. They'd be short by like 3 top lines, 4 to 6 Ds and at least the starting goalie, if not more. It'd be a disaster at this point after playing with mostly KHL team until now. 
17 Oh you precious soul
3 they would also shit all over a group of NAACPers, and i would be 10x more likely to watch that than the upcoming olympics
2 It was 2002 tyvm
1 although historically if canada was able to ice 3 teams they probably all finish close to the podium
1 there definitely is not. maybe a top 5 team, but no way in hell a bunch of 17 year olds that arent future generational players have a shot.  its not 1980 anymore.  how many junior players that look like studs totally wash out or become borderline NHLers? its a lot more common than you think. no one in canadian juniors would have ever played a team like what sweden could ice.  canadas only shot would be people who went to europe to play, however, now that the KHL might block players from attending, thats less likely
1 Yeah but a lot of the guys on the world Junior teams are NHL drafted players which I believe are also not allowed to play in the Olympics. Quick edit because of typos on mobile and a quick [source](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4237971)
1 Listen here you little shit!
19 Minnesota will enter as their own country for this. 
7 The CHL is packed with talent, definitely enough to challenge any other country for gold. Pretty much every Canadian NHL player came up through the CHL in their career.
7 Canada disagrees with you. 
2 As a Finn I'm okay with this. The more Finland vs Sweden matches I get to see the better.
3 Color me asinine.  I'd rather have the Olympics showcase new talent and leave professional sports to the professional sports leagues.
1 What's the point? IOC gives to athletes and organizes games. IKEA gives to all kinds of charitable causes. If either makes less profit they don't fucking care, they just give away less money.
1 Thank you for proving my point? Not sure what you were trying to accomplish by linking to an article that supports me.
17 This is a little different. The players generally want to play despite this and the NHL is telling them they aren't allowed to. So it would be like if your band was cool playing that bar down the road for free and your agent said "no because then I don't get my cut." And I'm scheduling gigs during that time you want to do that thing so you'd violate your contact if you went.
1 Actually no, they treat them the same way they treat every other sports association from any other event that have athletes in the Olympics. The NHL don't get to be special just because they want to be.
7 On the other hand football/soccer is, by far, the most watched sport on this planet because almost every single nation participates and cares for it. The Olympics are for many nations the only time when they care for many sports, and that is their chance to break through to other nations. Obviously, football/soccer clubs has demanded very direct insurance policies in return from FIFA sanctioned tournaments like the World Cup, the European Championships, Copa America, and so on, but there is no doubt that they do directly gain fans from the national team tournaments, after all, they're only every 2-4 years, but club tournaments are always on. If they liked the World Cup, chances are they might like what the clubs are doing in between those shows. If ice hockey wants to become anything else than a niche sport in the rest of the world, it needs world exposure, with the best from every nation competing, and the Olympics are just just that. The NHL can complain what they want that they don't get enough in return from the IOC (they probably don't), and that the IOC are just creaming their own cake (they most certainly do, especially in the Winter Olympics, where the ice hockey is by far their biggest global draw), but all in all, ice hockey is being drowned out, especially in its most lucrative market, North America; it needs global exposure. And the NHL pulling away from the Winter Olympics, is only them attempting to drown themselves slower than the IOC is. Something I personally don't have to care much about, after all I can watch a dozen football matches almost every week (except the odd year summers), but I only really care about ice hockey during the Winter Olympics and slightly during their yearly May World Championships. And if they just want to drown it in "the best weren't competing", then what was the point for caring for it in the first place?
3 OK, but it's legitimately way more exposure than the NHL will ever generate for any event they could possibly host. 80 percent of Canada watched the Gold Medal game in 2010. Like, four-fifths of the *entire population of the country*.
2 > Probably because almost every single game of the Stanley Cup finals gets higher ratings than the record viewership for an Olympic hockey game.Your last link was talking about a record for hockey *on a particular US cable network*. In 2010 the gold medal game of the Vancouver Olympics was on broadcast TV and [set records](https://www.nhl.com/news/olympic-final-most-watched-hockey-game-in-30-years/c-519476) way beyond anything a Stanley Cup game draws:* Most watched hockey game on US television since the 1980 Olympics* Most watched television broadcast in Canadian history, with 80% of the population watching partsAnd of course, I don't have numbers on this, but it gets way more viewership outside North America.
1 uhh... those links show the average views for Stanley cup finals at around 4 million, and the Olympic game at 6.5...
1 It's more about building fans than awareness. Someone who becomes a fan of hockey will buy merch, watch games, etc.
1 Because they ARE special. Other than Basketball, no other major international team sport sends it's best professional athletes to the Olympics and basketball is in the summer Olympics (for some reason, despite being invented as a winter sport) during the offseason.
1 I have no idea.
1 > The extra ad revenue of having the Olympics as the premiere international hockey tournament goes to the IOC instead of the NOCs thought, doesn't it?So what? If they win they get medals, what's the point here? Not everything is about money.>I'm honestly not really sure where the funding for NOCs comes from, is it distributed from the IOC or is it locally raised?[The USOC’s main sources of revenue are television broadcast rights, sponsorships and philanthropy in the form of major gifts and direct mail income. Additional funding comes from the government for Paralympic programming, as well as other sources such as the city of Colorado Springs and the U.S. Olympic Foundation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Committee)
6 Also because losing Sid hurts or kills a teams cup chances which while also related to money is not ONLY about money
0 WTF? TV rights and sponsoring obviously, ticket prices are irrelevant. You got any source on your claim? Advance notice: Don't just come up with numbers for the USA.
2 Pretty much this. It's all about money, I feel the IIHF or NHL looks at FIFA and the world cup. The Olympics are not important for Soccer it's all about the World Cup and FIFA profits from that. The NHL owners want the money from their stars playing at international level.
1 > I'd rather see Team Europe than Austria, Denmark, Germany and Latvia getting waxedEasy for you to say that when you're not from one of those countries. Even players on that team said they'd rather play for their own country and be less competitive.
1 I didn't like it because it wasn't the best players in the world. Teams like Russia and Sweden didn't have the chance to field a significant amount of their best players while Canada did. Meanwhile, instead of working to fix the discrepancy, the league made a youth team to show off its young players. It wasn't meant to be a best-on-best tournament, it was a show for publicity. The result was an unfair, uninteresting tournament that we knew the result to when it was announced. The players also didn't care. My god did they not care. The level of intensity in the Olympics or World Championship was not there. The U24s and Europeans had nothing to play for, and it was an empty prize at the end anyway. None of the players considered it similar to Olympic gold.Lastly, I actually like tournaments which include teams like Switzerland and Latvia. That's where some of the best hockey comes from, and part of the appeal is the possibility they might pull off an upset (which Switzerland seems to do on the regular). Team Europe nearly made it interesting, but even that isn't comparable to Olympic hockey.
1 1) It's mainly only NHL players, very few from other leagues, so it's not really best on best.2) It features stupid gimmick teams like Team Europe and the U23 team who had to play against their own countries.3) The players don't give half of a shit than what they do with the Olympics. For hockey players in Europe, Olympic Gold is the thing they dream about, not the Stanley Cup. 
3 Yeah, those sucked. We need more Canada vs Latvia 
1 Haha, I was joking. I like you Vindexus and you're not an idiot.
32 So if a player signs a multi-million contract to play for a NHL team, they should be able to refuse to play for that team to play in a completely different tournament instead?
9 You're completely ignoring the money.
12 The players made that decision when they signed a contract with an NHL team. If they want to retire from the NHL to go play in the Olympics or any league they can do that. Turns out the NHL pays them very very well, though, and there are strings that come attached to that paycheck.
5 And if they do get hurt, the NHL team gets to cancel their contract, immediately release them from the team and get paid back any money already paid.Sounds fair to me.
3 They shouldn't be allowed to. They're on a NHL contract, they're paid millions to be in the league. They can't just beak the contract because that is against the law. You couldn't just tell your boss "hey I'm leaving for 2 weeks to do this other job,I know you need me so sucks to be you". So why should they be allowed to do it.
1 It *is* up to the players. If they want to play in the Olympics enough to break their NHL contracts, that's their prerogative. They'd likely be re-signed after the olympics anyway, but they would also likely face financial penalties for terminating the contracts.In short, the players are completely free to go to the Olympics, they'll just lose a lot of... money. So are the players greedy bastards for not backing out of their contracts?Why is it OK for players to be money-focused, but not the people that pay those players?
3 Seriously lol it's basically just as much of a shit show money-grab as the IOC.
3 World Cup happens during the off-season for the biggest leagues. Olympics happen during the teams' training camps IIRC but the Olympic tournament is U23 with the exception of three players who can be older anyway.
3 fair enough, i read your comment as snarky but i guess i misinterpreted. NHL and IOC were in a real weird duel here.  they both had leverage and lots to lose, from what i read, the NHL made concessions while the IOC refused.  
3 Basketball doesn't have to put their season on hold.
2 I was being a little sassy about the football part. I'm not sure there is another sport like hockey we can compare to. As far as I know, for most Olympic sports, winning an Olympic medal is the top achievement. 
1 [Canada just had their Grey Cup](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/11/27/08/wire-1800430-1511770271-636_634x405.jpg)
3 Not Canadian either.
2 >You think when the first Olympics started in 1896 the goal was to create entertainment?  100%, unequivocally yes. >You think the kids playing football at their local football club are trying to generate entertainment? Yes, most of those kids are entertaining themselves. Do you think most kids at their local football club are doing it for the big contracts they don't have?HAHAHAHAHAHA That is just a ridiculous way to think. >Sports and the IOC principle goal is not to create entertainment. The principal goal of sports is to entertain the players, that's why they are considered recreation. >Try to play some sports, so you could understand it.I did. I went to college on a football scholarship. Played for entertainment while I was young. I was good enough to earn a value exchange and I played college football in exchange for an education. 
2 They can say that all they want but the best of them won't be competing for the gold this time around.
1 Umm... no? Why would it be greedy to not want to hand your opponents a huge advantage for nothing in return?
3 If players run on dreams and goals, the NHL shouldn't have to offer multi-million contracts then should they?
1 It isn't, but that's reality.
1 The ultimate goal for a lot of North American hockey players is the Stanley cup, but it is a gold medal for every European/Russian hockey player. There are even Canadian/American players who have said they'd rather win a gold medal.
2 It's a shame he had to go represent his country in the Olympics and get hurt because he represented too hard.
1 It was pretty bad. Typical gimmicky NHL junk like the Winter Classic with forced television rivalries and made up teams. Playing in September. Ugh I hate Bettman.
1 Watching NA beat Sweden was one of the best games I've seen
1 World championships are even more meaningless. Half of the players are still in the NHL playoffs during the tournament, or just choose not to go. 
1 I mean the glamour of teams playing with their countrymen is the reason I like international hockey and while the WCoH games were fun, Team NA and Team Europe don't really have the same prestige.Also locking out young players like McDavid from team Canada is stupid IMO 
12 On the plus side, it did lead to one of the best hockey tweets of all time with Phil Kessel tweeting out while USA was getting killed that he felt like there was something he was supposed to be doing that day 
1 How is it terrible? It is still the best of the best, you still see the same Canadian team playing the same Swedish team, it's still fun to watch. There is nothing wrong with it. People only seem to hate it because it isn't the Olympics. The only difference is that it doesn't have the glamour of the Olympics. If that is the only reason you watch then you're not a hockey fan. I watch because I want to watch the best hockey players play each other and I want to watch good hockey. Don't really know why it would matter if it is under the NHL or not. I guess you're salty and pissed about stupid shit.
2 Thanks for the answer, that is a pity.
1 It was amazing hockey last year at the World Cup. Are you telling me you didn't enjoy Team North America? That was incredible talent.
1 And the World Cup is the epitome of quality international competition. IIHF, World Cup of Hockey, etc all have huge limiting factors to the competitiveness; they're never the worlds top hockey teams by country facing off to see who's best.
3 As a brazillian if baffled me how many people here were glorifying the 1-0 win vs Germany in the last olympics finals when Germany lacked a single star player from the main squad while we even saved Neymar to play on that awful tournament lmao 
1 Nobody watches the youth tournaments either.. That doesn't mean they're not good or interesting.
3 Yup, its also the reason people usually list the olympic soccer winners and not the world cup winners. 
3 For me it all depends on what you go in expecting. I love hockey in many forms, but when I go see an NHL game, I want NHL quality. When I go see an AHL game, I know I'm not getting NHL quality.I'm not taking anything away from World Juniors, the Frozen Four, or anything like that. I'm just saying that in this specific format (the Olympic Men's ice hockey tournament), there are certain expectations now. 
3 Last projection I saw had Ben Scrivens as one of the goaltenders.  So yeah.
1 This sort of seems like you agree with me then? Did you change your mind over the course of our comments?
1 The spengler cup usually has one team from finnish and swedish leagues not an all star team from their leagues. That is far different.
1 The AHL can't send any of their good players.. they're all associated with NHL clubs.
25 I'ma be sad when the NBA gets its own PED scandal
1 >Every sport we watchThat being; every sport where there is no internationally recognized championship.  I feel a lot of American's are more non-nonchalant about doping due to the prevalence of looser regulations in 'professional' sports.  By this I mean a lot of the blatant PED use in baseball up until Jose Canseco blew the lid off that.  Now you see guys like A-Rod getting called out quicker - albeit the practice still occurs.  As for basketball, football, or even hockey for that matter, I'm unsure, but I know that in weight lifting it's virtually completely accepted outside the international circuits and Olympics.As for international sports though, countries will work together using third parties to ensure testing cannot be faked. Rare cases like the Tour De France were for a time, but only because of literal generations of practice being deceitful and inner agreements to not snitch.With other sports like Soccer (Football) or Tennis, both very popular sports world-wide, you are much less likely to see steroid use acceptance due to the presence of a international influence into testing.  
1 I mean everyone is on PED's but it's how you define illegal vs legal ones that makes the difference 
1 Unless it's combat fighting 
1 That's why I only watch good clean fake sports, like WWE wrestling.
1 Is it though? These are drugs that shave handfuls of seconds off of times. It may be a significant advantage, but is it really that much more exciting for the audience for most Olympic events? To me, the tension and drama are the result of the performances and results relative to other competitors. If everyone was 3-4 seconds slower without PEDs, it would still come down to tense fights over fractions of seconds for victory while being imperceptibly slower overall. Unless a PED can produce more marquis moments in a sport, like homeruns and big hits in baseball, I'd say they don't add much to the experience.

12 idk man, difficult to tell for an observer if it's LSD, shrooms, mescaline, 25-i, 4-bromo, etc, could be anything really

1 >I'd like to have both quite honestly, and separated. See what the finest can do naturally which is still impressive.  Honestly I think most people would see the difference, realize natural limits are extremely far below the level they're accustomed to, and viewership would be like that of the WNBA.

1 Sign up for the Olympic team to play baseball, end up patriotically drowning along with several confused and terrified horses. 
1 Check out [Eric Moussambani's swimming heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rqI8xwXVac) from 2000 in Sydney. The guy took up swimming eight months before the event, practiced in a lake somewhere in Equatorial Guinea, and had up until the event never seen a full-sized Olympic swimming pool before in his life.Shows that it's not necessarily about winning or breaking world records. It's about participating, about doing one's best. Pretty sure that when he was completely spent with 20 meters to go, all that carried him to the finish line was the amazing crowd that cheered for him as if he was Phelps.(Honorable mention to Robel Kieros Habte, representing Ethiopia (and dadbods worldwide) that [finished a similar race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1j7y1BDlA4) against actual people.)
1 I want an Olympic event where one person in each category is someone who said some version of "That looks easy" or "I could do that"
1 The Olympics actually used to be like this, They have since made it all but impossible for average people to compete. Mostly because whenever it happened the 'average' athlete got disproportionate media coverage and no one liked that. 
1 Someone fit, someone who doesn't necessarily work out, and someone who gets winded walking up steps.  Then we have a good baseline.
1 Yes it's on Netflix
3 Nah, there's pills for that too. There's pills for everything.Wanna get jacked beyond all belief? Take these steroids. Still wanna get the wedding tackle up? Take this little pill. Don't want any babies because your super swole husband has been poking you with his heavily engorged member every night? Take a pill a day.That pill you're taking to keep from having a baby is causing hormonal imbalance and now you're suffering from severe mood swings? Take this pill, too.That pill we gave you for the mood swings is causing some issues with insomnia? Take this sleeping pill.
5 Ehhhh, I only have trouble with that when I stop the steroids. So the trick is to just stay on them forever. Who needs a liver anyway? 
1 Olympics 2068: The Chicks Have The Dicks 
1 They boycotted the US 84 Olympics because the US boycotted the 1980 Soviet Olympics because the USSR invaded Afghanistan.
1 The modern Olympics has always been a worldwide pony show of which country is the best. The entire point of it is so countries can rub their rivals face in their inferiority. Russia cheating just gives them a political edge, even if it's just a tiny one.The original Greek Olympics were probably very similar, but I don't know a lot on that specific subject, so I could be wrong.
1 Look at Putin’s approval rating before and after Sochi and you have your answer. Same thing with the CCP and Beijing. Olympics are a nice and fun treat to a first world country. To a second or third world autocracy the Olympics are a critical propaganda tool.
-1 Canada ain't exactly a shining beacon either. Our own ministers have a level of childish corruption that is so disgusting in it's execution, I'm astonished the world somehow thinks he's worth anything.
1 I believe you've lost the thread here.
5 It's just edgy to pretend that the US isn't far and away the best country on Earth to live in. One dipshit-in-Chief doesn't change that. But reddit is filled with 20-year-olds that know more than everyone else and have the memory of a fucking mosquito.
-1 Inner Detroit is probably close, and most of Russia is nice enough.
1 > Maybe low oil prices might hurt PutinRussia isn't one trick pony. At very least we are only country who can send people to ISS now. With other country with manned space flight program is China. Our budget is calculated from $40 oil (Brent) while it is now $60 and excesses are being put into reserves. So we are ready for prices slashed by third.It's not like people in Russia particularly like Putin. It's more likely we don't want revolution or abrupt change. Only successful revolution in Russia was when Russia was loosing world war, head of the state was literally retarted, some peasant was fucking his wife, and head of security service literally used terrorists to kill government officials. Then revolution come and made things worse.Putin for all his failings best leader Russia had for last century or maybe last thousand years. We want to try to live somewhat stable in the hope that institutions will grow and take roots. "Fake it till make it". Russia doesn't have death sentence, we have universal healthcare and free higher education. Formally we have division of branches of power.  Russia is very secular ( while 80% consider themself orthodox christian less than 50% believe in god)We are not that backward. But I see much more hate than say Saudis who behead people on the streets for using magic.
1 Аккаунтом ошибся, или просто решил в ветку влезть?
1 Thank you interesting. Though there isn't exactly a lot of info. Just two posts. Without data. I will look into it.
1 There isn't anti-gay law in Russia. There is a law ( dumb law) that states something like that"If you start conversation with person younger than 18 about how it is awesome "gay way of life" is, then you will be fined for $100. If that person started conversation him/herself then it's ok. Also if you are teacher or psychologist that works with such chidren that is also ok" It's not anti-gay law in a sense that first person who was fined according to that law was hetero.
1 Of course it is evil, thing is, people who whine about it have a really odd stand on what Russia should do.Aka, they should disregard the opinion of 90% to please 10%. To do that would be political suicide, first. Second off, the queer 'oppression' is mostly a ban on gay pride parades. Gays don't get stuffed in concentration camps in Russia, only in Chechnya. A semi-independent, muslim republic. And even that's dubious.But hey, it's fine as long as a group you like do it. You won't mind it,  either, when your friends have a similar stance on the problem: it's friends, after all.
1 No. They were jailed for doing a 'punk prayer' in a church.You can criticize Putin fine. You'lol get in trouble for breaking a law.

5 Dat refractory period tho 
1 Of course you could, but that’s not what we’re talking about right now. Seems like you’re trying to deflect from the point I made.
1 Like I said to the other guy, of course that’s true; but that’s not what the conversation is about. It sounds like you’re trying to deflect from the topic at hand.
1 Your whole post was implying that Russia is somehow isolated and disliked by the "rest of the world", which is blatantly untrue. It may be the case for US and Europe, but that's about it. 
1 > > This has been used there since the advent of Communism. It's their favorite tactic.See ["And you are lynching Negroes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes)

54 The only reason to kill a witness who has already testified, is to make an example out of them, in order to keep others from ratting you out. It just doesn’t make any sense to keep that under the rug 
11 Yes.They'd either not actually be planning on leaving evidence to tie them to it (a likely plan, and the feds do have to follow certain rules), or they'll use somebody that's willing to die or go to prison in exchange for favors or cash.If the cartels could boast that not even the combined might of the US government and the Witness Protection Program could protect rats and snitches from cartel retribution, that would be huge.
15 The feds are gonna rain down anyway if you kill a witness under protection. But there's no point in killing a witness if nobody knows about it. So yeah, they would spread the word.
3 If there is someone who is in Witness Protection for testifying against you, I'm willing to bet the feds are already "raining down" on you.
1 Terrible shame. But what's a man to do, put his firearm in his front pocket?
1 I think he clearly stubs the brightest flames, but the issue with Russian politics is that the only people that get to the stage to become president are just as bad if not worse than Putin.Any decent human being would get "taken care of" a few months after they get in to politics.Putin is horrible, but he is a symptom, not the disease itself. If you remove Putin now I can't name a single politician to be a good replacement. The entire government needs to be replaced with people who actually just want to do good. But that wont ever happen. Source: Am Russian.  
1 Not really. It's a cultivated myth that Putin kills his opponent. In fact Putin surprisingly do not like killing opponents. Instead he is a man of balance. He prefer to put one oppositioner into jail and release another one, support one oppositioner and release unpleasant truth about another one, etc. For example Nemtsov was his friend and they worked together and insider from Kremlin said that when Putin got message that Nemtsov was shot he was furious.
-6 Then I guess their whole society just needs to collapse.  If what you say is true (and it is), then that's really the only way people come to Jesus on the matter.
1 If you worked for FSB and suddenly start get payments from MI6 - be ready to drink some polonium tea, yeah. 
61 Everytime something negative about Russia pops up, there's always a deluge of comments trying to shift the narrative to how the US is bad. 
21 Manning is out of jail
20 Chelsea Manning ultimately ended up with 7 years for leaking classified information. Hardly "forever." 
4 Whistleblowing isn't a crime in of itself, in this country.  Many instances of people whistleblowing, not breaking any laws, and not going to jail.  Where-as in Russia, any Putin wants to be a crime *is* a crime.
2 The result isnt the same since killing whistleblowers makes them  martyrs or only imprisoning them for breaking some law sends different message to the society.
1 > Uh yeah, life in federal prison not much better than a death sentenceI forget. Do you get a public defender when they send death squads for you?  I'm sure they let you prove your innocence, right?
17 That's not what happened with Chelsea Manning. Wild speculation to fuel your whataboutism is fun though.
3 When did Cuba become part of the US??
1 Which whistleblowers have been placed in Gitmo?
13 Your best example is a bad conspiracy theory even his parents didn't buy into? Eesh.
3 Well, yeah, Russia wouldn't kill American whistleblowers, just like America wouldn't kill Russian whistleblowers
1 I've not heard this before, sd you have any reputable sources on this. Not because I don't believe you, I just have minimal knowledge of the situation (I am Canadian) and I'd like to know both sides as I've only heard him be touted as a hero. 
-1 That's a pretty dumb way to describe it. Anything that harms the US in any way =  acting in the interests of the Russian government.
2 Nah, Udall and Warner did that at a Senate Select Hearing months prior. Caused one of the NSA guys to perjurer himself (he later sent in an amended testimony to save his ass). On phone but you can look it up. Fun fact: Democrats have had the "Ending Secret Laws Act" for awhile now which solves a lot of the problems.
5 I know Trump has said that he wants to kill him but I doubt he would be allowed to. Also, in the past Obama gave Manning clemency. So let's not pretend both countries are the same in this respect. 
16 He wouldn't actually be found guilty of treason but of the espionage act. Treason is defined in the Constitution in a way that makes it almost impossible to prosecute anyone who doesn't literally go to war against the U.S.
5 The US federal government has only executed three people since 1963, all of them convicted of first-degree murder. No American has been executed for treason since 1862.Edward Snowden would in all likelihood, at worst, be convicted of espionage (not treason) and sentenced to life in prison. If you think it was likely, or even reasonably plausible, for Snowden  to be sentenced to death by a modern federal court, you're either ignorant or delusional.
10 A trial and legal execution. Not an 'accident' or 'suicide'. The difference is due process and the rule of law and possibly most importantly the lack of some ominous cloud over society that you must not do anything against the government whether technically legal or not, which serves to keep people from questioning authority.
3 The United States doesn't kill people for treason anymore... Educate yourself. Tell me when the last person convicted of treason was killed in the United States. Go back to r/russia kid. 
11 Which whistleblower has been in solitary confinement without legal counsel for the rest of their life?
8 Please show me the last U.S. whistleblower to be sentenced to life in solitary confinement. Equalizing Russia's treatment of dissidents to what the U.S. does is a strategy of Russian disinformation. You don't have to establish that U.S. policy is innocent to state that Russian politics is far more fucked up. 
6 He's trying to deflect criticism of Russia, by hopelessly trying to make it about how the US is bad.If you think the Russian and the US or any other western country on are equal footing compared with killing journalists and whistleblowers, you're pretty out of touch. 
1 This whole thread is about Russian cheating and corruption. If you think its unfair to talk about that subject in the aftermath of them getting banned from the Olympics, find a different thread.No, the US and Russia are not equivalent when it comes to killing journalists and whistleblowers.Even if it were, it's irrelevant and doesn't excuse Russia's actions.Whataboutism is lazy and transparent. Also, it's not just Americans who have an issue with the Russian government. No idea why you added that in there. 
-1 As expected of human nature. Always attack the outsider instead of reforming oneself. This is one aspect of human nature that will never ever change.
2 Well at first it's fine, you get to sit around and think... and think... and think. Then a day passes and you start to over think everything. The meals seem to come on a schedule so your days seem laid out, but just to keep yourself entertained you analyze every single aspect of your life. You analyze and respond to every situation you can possibly think of.A week passes, your routine is fairly unchanged but you feel so tired.A month passes, wait, was it a month? You aren't so sure anymore. Your body hurts, your head hurts, even your eyes hurt. Your muscles feel achy and you feel so hungry and thirsty... You feel like you should exercise but you don't have the strength or will to even move.6 months pass. You can't stop the screaming inside your head. You want it to stop, you beat your head against your hands to make it stop. You scream for help. Nothing. You contemplate suicide constantly just to make the loneliness stop.You're no longer sure how much time has passed. Has it been a year? 2? 8 months? You have no idea. If you havn't tried to kill yourself by now, you definitely are now. You'll say and do anything to get out. Admit to a crime? I did it. I did everything, I will sign everything, just get me out.My uncle spent 5 years in confinement and this is how he explained it to me. [Alfred Woodfox](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/albert-woodfox-released-louisiana-jail-43-years-solitary-confinement) survived 43 years, likely only because they gave him 1 hour a day outside. I wouldn't wish that kind of hell on even my worst enemy.
4 Holy shit you write like Boris Badenov speaks.  What is Natasha up to these days?  It's nice to see you have a job as a Russian troll on Reddit.  What does that pay?  Probably better than that moose and squirrel show you were on.
5 >40 years of solitaryIs that a specific example?  I'd be interesting in reading more about that whistleblower, thanks in advance.
18 Actually it doesn't have to fit at all. It plays on the lowest emotions, truth and logic doesn't matter. They use fabricated stories (nowadays called fake news) which can be retracted or fixed later, if the plot holes are too obvious but then it's too late. People already seen it and believe it. Photos from Iraq or Afghanistan were passed as fresh from the Ukraine fights and the audience took it all in. They serve to produce reactions, demonize the enemy, ignite hatred and simple arguments. People won't fact check and won't believe any correction from the other side so it's well played.
1 I appreciate reading through your thoughtful replies. You have a very neutral and accepting perspective toward the extreme confirmation bias your wife shows. I have to ask though, do you think there will be any kind of evidence to trigger some sort of epiphany for your wife and open her eyes to the "truth" of the misinformation? If so, what do you think it would take? Anything less than seeing it with her own eyes?
1 >They are never exposed to English (except for American pop and rock), and English in elementary schools is sub par at best.Your knowledge about Russia and English there is the only thing that is sub par. English in schools taught from 3 class till 11 class and also continues in University or College for another 1-2 years if it's not language based one. It's a decent programm that only weak spot is a lack of auditions and speech training. Reading/Writing is okay. Idea that somehow Russians don't seek information outside is also false. There a lot of news in Russia that just translate english sources or post actual information and there a lot of people who read AP, NYT, WP and Bild. The thing is why people don't like to read opposition news in Russia is because they constantly push their agenda about how shitty in Russia regardless of the actual state.
1 Makes you wonder if we’re not the ones being fed the propaganda? I’m mean, how does anyone really know? The issues are too complicated to be researched independently- I can’t just pick up everything and go to Ukraine to see if the soldiers are there, etc. I depend on sources other than my own objective reality to make conclusions. Who’s to say those sources are telling the truth? 
1 Yeah we russians are really stupid
4 But it *is* willful ignorance, since those things are objectively false. There’s no subjectivity to “did the US land on the moon?” or “There is a shadow world government that controls world economies.” Those theories don’t have a basis in fact, they have a basis in specific lack of fact leading to bad deductive reasoning.
2 Where did datterberg claim to be perfect? Having some grasp of reality is a bare minimum requirement for me being willing to interact with someone, as well. My imperfections include failing to be "kind" or "humble", at times, unlike Pxzib's wife (apparently? Though if she really buys into all of the russian conspiracy theories, she's almost certainly a racist and homophobe as a result), but different people can have different values, and I value "not completely delusional" above most other traits.
1 Implying everyone is equally retarded? Some people are less rational than others. 
1 Russia is pretty fucking evil. They literally poison journalists and opposition leaders. Look up the reason for the creation of the Magnitsky Act. 
1 > if we didn't have liberals to defend their rights.or, you know, a Supreme Court decision
4 It definitely does. It's called the US Military. There are many people in the 'intelligence' services who spend their time doing nothing but pumping out propaganda. Here's an example: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networksAnd if you think that the 'independent' news distribution services in the US aren't influenced by the government in what they print/show and when, well, I've got a bridge in Sydney to sell you.
4 Because I don't think Trump lasts past the 2018 elections, because I have faith that we have enough checks and balances to stop someone from becoming a dictator. 
1 This is part of the Soviet plan, not just electing Trump.  But creating a divisive country and using our free speech laws to sow doubt into our faith in the Republic.  Trump is just another passing visitor to the white house.  There have been bad presidents before, he won't be the last, the system will still be running.
22 You're right. We shouldn't punish innocent athletes and there isn't a perfect solution.
31 Do you think they *didn't* spend millions on exactly that while trying to cover the program up?
3 They have done all manner of things to cheat and for a very long time. See here - [link](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/russian-charged-with-olympic-figure-skating-fix-1.306552):>Investigators said they have a recording of phone calls between Tokhtakhounov and a French ice dancer, in which the Russian boasts of his ability to influence judges, according to the officials. >A Globe and Mail article published during the Games also alleged that the ice-dancing competition results were pre-determined.>The newspaper said judges had conspired to place Canadian duo Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz in fourth and Lithuanians Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas and fifth. ...>At the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Bourne and Kraatz finished fourth after placing third at the previous two World Championships. Afterward, the pairs' coach, Natalia Dubova, accused the Ukraine, Czech Republic, Russia, Italy and France of bloc voting to ensure that Anissina and Peizerat finished third.>After the Nagano Games, Jean Senft, a former international judge from Canada, tried to report what she felt was corruption among judges.>Months after the charges, the ISU suspended Senft for international bias.>The following year, at the 1999 world championships in Helsinki, a cameraman caught judges from Russia and the Ukraine exchanging what appeared to be foot signals during the pairs final.
1 Gee, I wonder where the money could come from. -_-
1 I mean, how do you think they ended up in Sochi in the first place?
1 Happy Birthday Paulie
-1 So pride means you deliberately stop thinking about the horrible things your country has done and only focus on the good?  Must be why pride is a sin.  Fuck your pride.
-1 I simply expressed my view of national pride. No where did I ask anyone not to feel proud of whatever they want to feel proud about.
1 If you live in a country, you live under the government and the state.Your country is defined by it.Land and (to the lesser extent) people have nothing to do with lines on a map and countries as such. They are separate entities. Country and government are not.And even disregarding that, loving people has nothing to do with being proud of a country, IMO.
1 According to the guy that ran the Russian program, the vast majority of Russian athletes were involved. I have no problem with putting those athletes on probation, they deserve extra scrutiny.
2 Yes nhl has pulled out but Russian players were planning on going anyway. Ovechkin had permision from his owner to go and he wasn't the only player
1 Advancing isn't a one-way street, we must always be cautious about our more primal instincts.  The power of mob mentality and fear of the other has been with us since the beginning.
1 We will have to wait and see if this is a hiccup or a permanent shift of cultures.  To me, it appears many of the groups you mentioned are already on a downturn and will be short-lived.
2 From what I understand, the price of oil dropped largely due to fracking for natural gas.  This would have happened in the US regardless of world politics.  If Putin wanted to improve the state of Russia, he had the opportunity to provide incentives for his citizens to use the capital they had to promote growth and stabilize the Russian economy.  He chose to extort half of it and invade Crimea instead.
1 Nope. Quite unironically. That's why we're so good at wars of attrition and so bad at civic infrastructure.
4 That really sucks for the Russian people. Even worse is the way they've been misled by Putin's government over the years. Part of me wonders if they would even vote for a real opposition candidate if given the chance.
1 Exactly. It's truly unfortunate that people can be so deeply affected by misinformation. If the Russian people really understood their situation and the possible alternatives I imagine they'd be rioting in the streets until Putin and his cronies were stripped of power. 
1 If the opposition had access to media and was not persecuted at every step for running a campaign, this rating would shrink in months, long before the elections. 
1 It really depends on how you look at it.As an example, all of those industries you mentioned play a pretty sizable role in the economies of various countries.the Olympics is a temporary economic boost with long-term detrimental financial/economic impact.
5 If you don't think a head of state chiefly concerned with his country's image on the world stage is involved in decisions regarding his **Olympic athletes**, then you're not very bright.
-1 Russians support the invasions though we can’t look at it from our American lens and say it’s bad for Russia . Russians view those as good for Russia primarily the Crimea invasion. Many Russians already viewed Crimea as part of Russia before that. So from the view of a Russian those are indeed good things. As for the murdering I admittedly know little about it or how Russians feel about it
1 I didn't necessarily say the two were equivalent, just that the US was not innocent in that conflict. The US has a long history of supporting dictators as well, so it's not like Russia is outstandingly evil or anything. 
1 "All the smartest people compare IQs, and Trump has always been on top. Believe me."
1 Every single sport has some sort of international competition outside of the Olympics. Every one. The uniqueness of the Olympics is that it's the sole place where you compete under your national flag, alongside other athletes from your country.And gear is usually limited in some form. See the swim suits that are banned for being too good. Doping is banned because money shouldn't completely equate to victory, and because of the potential for extremely negative physical consequences from it (and if you let some people, others will be forced to do so to keep up, which imposes negative consequences on *anyone* who wants to compete and sets a very poor standard for impressionable people watching).
1 Surprisingly, PEDs actually do exist in sports like Chess (e.g. Ritalin).
1 But is doping cheating if all countries do it?
1 Great rebuttal from someone who thinks Olympic medals aren't a real prize and people in the 1930s had in-depth knowledge of other states' affairs.
0 I think the interesting question (and the much harder to prove question) is whether or not intentional negligence, or avoiding involvement, at the state level that passively reduces or diminishes (By way of reduced funds, people, equipment) the ability to obtain honest evidence and use honest testing methodologies means a state has some culpability.
1 Thank you! And thanks for not being a total douche about it. 
1 The article says non doping athletes can compete under the Olympic flag. Asking for a source isn't me denying the fact, I couldn't find anything about Russia not letting their athletes go since all the articles are about the ban. 
1 You're wrong.From the actual report:>The IOC DC has not found any documented, independent and impartial evidence confirming the support or the knowledge of this system by the highest State authority.https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/Who-We-Are/Commissions/Disciplinary-Commission/IOC-DC-Schmid/IOC-Disciplinary-Commission-Schmid-Report.pdfFYI, I watched Icarus too.
1 > their national coaches were offering themDifferent than being "state sponsored." Russia's government and intelligence agencies were involved, rather than simply coaching staff. 
1 Mildly tangential--but the whole thing is such a money maker. The incentive to dope is too high compared to the risks, from the athletes to the coaches to the country. I wish someone smarter than I could figure out how to disincentivize it. 
1 Holy heck that first sentence. What a totally immature reaction to what I said. I take it you don't watch or follow track and field at all do you? Here's a little wiki page about it. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_sportspeople_in_doping_casesSeriously dude. Why do you talk about something you know fuck all about?
1 No I don't care. I watch that shit fully knowing 90% of them are on it. It only bothers me seeing mouth breathers think it's just a one off thing. 
1 >Nice to see there's at least one organisation out there that's had enough of Russia's shit.>Though it's a sad state of affairs when even the IOC has more integrity than the United States.^ Implying that even given US sanctions—which is the *only thing* the US has done to Russia so far and is a given—the IOC is the *one organization* that has had "enough of Russia's shit" and has more *integrity* than the US.I then asked you what more the US could do beyond lob insults and start WW3 with military action.So a temper tantrum and now you're backtracking and attempting to state that you didn't state what you actually did. 😂
1 That 2010 gold medal game may have been the best all around hockey game I've ever seen. On top of that the atmosphere was incredible.
1 Sometimes I got back and watch the Vancouver final game and then follow up by watching Canadian reaction videos. It's the only time I feel patriotic really. But damn if it doesn't get me teary eyed. 
2 Wow didnt know that
1 Source? I thought the IIHF president said they would see what they can do about getting players there who want to go
1 What a magical time to be alive and watching the movie starring Kurt Russell.
1 Anyone with any talent in women’s hockey is from 3 countries so that’s not surprising 
3 Yes same lenght but 18% wider
1 NHL Ice is 200x85 Olympic is 200x100
18 And some European teams would get shit in by them,what else is new
3 That sounds like the most likely outcome but it'd be awesome to watch a team of rookies kick some ass
1 I think you're over estimating the talent difference.  A guy I grew up with has been pretty dominant in euro leagues, even played in the KHL.  He was above average NCAA college hockey player that was undrafted.  Went to Europe after not cutting it in the AHL.The world thought the Russians would shit on a bunch of college kids in 1980 and look how well that turned out.edit: guess there is no reason to speculate, we'll see soon enough.
7 Seriously. I'm trying to fathom how that really happened. Edit: I now realize I'm Amerocentric. Guess that makes sense. This edit is at 1m post time. Don't call me out. 
1 Ah fair, at least we have that tournament right around the corner though. 
4 If we could include NHL'ers, we'd seriously compete for bronze.EDIT: This is as good as I could come up with for eligible (no NHL or KHL contract) Minnesotans...**Forwards**Travis MorinRyan CarterBen Hanowski Mason Bergh Ryan PoehlingCasey Mittelstadt Rem Pitlick Tommy NovakJake Jaremko Blake McLaughlin Riley Tufte**Defense**Mark StuartTom GilbertJimmy SchuldtJordan GrossWill BorgenJack Ahcan**Goalie**Jake KiellyJohn CurryMichael Bitzer
1 And a lot of Americans now too. Problem is for us Americans, USA Hockey doesn't like those Americans anymore. 
1 That's what YOU want. Not what the majority wants, nor is it the principle of the olympics.You want "new talent", watch the major juniors. The rest of us want to see the best vs. the best. 
1 They definitely care if they make less money. That's less for them to pocket. 
7 The NHL tried to make a deal with the players (extending the CBA which would delay the next lockout) but the players union came out and said they where not interested in giving anything up to go. Rather they should be allowed to go because they have been in the past.
1 Which leagues are these?  The only comparable ones are the NBA, where the Olympics take place in the off-season and the major European Football associations all begin immediately following the Olympics.  Sure, baseball returns to the Olympics in 2020 but the MLB is [likely to take the same stance](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-commish-rob-manfred-admits-its-unlikely-mlb-players-will-play-in-2020-olympics/) the NHL did.
4 Figure skating is the Winter Olympics’ biggest draw, not ice hockey. 
1 http://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-olympic-sports-2014-2Given that this is not the most popular, but the sport most talked about on Facebook, I still believe that across the world other winter sports are more popular. I lived in Asia for a long while, and people there don't give a f about ice hockey in general, figure skating/speed skating is generally the most popular there (because their country often actually does well in those categories), and since Olympics itself is a very nationalistic event many countries that don't have a solid hockey foundation does not care about hockey. So it's more of a chicken or egg problem, will Olympics really increase Hockey participation in other countries, or the reverse?
6 You're saying the country where 50% of NHL players come from and where the sport is the most watched had a lot of people watching the gold medal game of that sport?Colour me shocked.
1 I was saying that if the IOC gets the benefits but not the costs it's unfair for the NOCs, and it could eat up a lot of the budget for smaller countries. From your link:>Under the terms of the new agreement, the USOC is guaranteed seven percent of the U.S. broadcast revenue and 10 percent of the IOC’s global sponsorship revenue.That's interesting. So it looks like the NOCs do get a chunk of the broadcast/sponsorship revenue, which is definitely going to go down in some countries without NHLers. I'm surprised that that they still didn't think it was worth paying, or did it fall through because the IOC negotiates directly with the NHL? I have to imagine the Canadian Olympic Comitee would have been pushing really hard to get a deal done. 
1 I meant which EVENT generates the most revenue. Also, since hockey is the most watched it commands the most for advertising prices when it's aired. It also generates the most sponsor money since it's most viewed. Do you think bobsled generates as much in sponsor or TV money? Do you know how advertising and sponsorship works?Advance notice: I'm not wasting anymore time on this. Look it up yourself. It's all there. 
1 That's true, and that's why I prefer the Olympics too. Playing for your country means a lot more (to most) than just winning in general, I was just talking about overall quality of play 
1 The U23 team was one of the most fun teams to watch.   There was an absurd amount of speed and skill on the team, not sure how that is a gimmick.  They were a legitimate team.
1 I actually didn't mind having them in the WCOH, I was just highlighting it is no replacement for the Olympics. For example Switzerland always puts up a decent team for the Olympics but there are not a whole lot of Swiss players in the NHL.
1 I like you too you aren't a jerk.
4 Not sure how it works in other sports, but I know that the fifa in football dictates that players can be called upon by their country to play at any time to prevent this exact thing from happening.
-10 In the case of the Olympics, the sporting event thats brings together the entire world, than yes I think they should be allowed to skip a few weeks of the season to represent their country. 
0 Don't you think at least *some* big name / top players would WANT go to the Olympics regardless of the money?
-6 That won’t happen, any player good enough to play in the Olympics is good enough to heal up and keep on the team. You actually think if Ovi got hurt they would release him, just to get picked up by another team willing to wait a little for him to heal? Do you even watch hockey?
0 You do know that NHL players have been in multiple Olympics before all this happened, right? With no problems? 
1 Yea I remember the whole thing playing out in a really confusing way, and honestly stopped paying attention because I had other shit going on. I threw up an edit to clarify what I was asking about and what I found out. Your info was helpful so thank you.
1 >Yes, most of those kids are entertaining themselves. Do you think most kids at their local football club are doing it for the big contracts they don't have?The best don't just play for fun. The kids that play for fun stops when it stops being fun. They play to win. They play to compete and the Olympics was created to compete between nations, like we have all wanted to do. If the Olympics was just about entertainment we would have changed every sports event and made it more fun. But we didn't, for the sake of competition. Most people play to compete, and that is why we need standardised rules. The IOC ensures that the Competition is even, and Russia destroyed the illusion that nobody uses doping so they got punished. 
-1 Supply and demand, most hockey players do run dreams and goals. Hell, I bet a lot of NHL players would play for free if they weren't that talented.
1 There's talent every year at the world juniors. The NHL "World" Cup just seems shallow and corporate and exists as a cash grab to take over national team jersey sales
1 I guess it's just because it was the only trophy you guys didn't win so it makes sense. Otherwise it's a completely meaningless competition. 
1 I didn't say they weren't good or interesting. I was ridiculing the idea that they are more interesting than the World Cup.
1 Who does that?
1 For sure. I'm saying for the casual fan that probably wouldn't notice the differences between and NHL and ECHL level game, they should really give it a chance. The games will most likely be a lot more wide open and less defensively sound due to the skillset of the players, short time getting familiar with line mates, and less involved coaching, it's gonna lead to some barn burners. The names and faces will be less recognizable but the hockey itself will be memorable.
1 > This sort of seems like you agree with me thenI still wouldn't consider Canada to be the favorites.  I think your Spengler Cup comment has some validity, but my point is that if the KHL players can't participate, then the Canadian team will be weaker than what we'd see in the Spengler Cup.
1 I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  It doesn't seem like we're discussing about the same thing since we've already established multiple times that the best players in the world will not be there.
18 Same it's my favorite league. But I mean. PEDs are there.
1 >The NBA interfering with the basal way that it has been designed to operate for the last 30 yearsOkay
1 I have been waiting years for an olympics to be created for athletes that want to dope. Then we can finally get real records shattered and make it exciting when a non doper is beating a doper in a sport.
1 > With other sports like Soccer (Football) or Tennis, both very popular sports world-wide, you are much less likely to see steroid use acceptance due to the presence of a international influence into testing.Not sure about tennis but drug-testing in football (soccer) is a joke. Every big footballer is using it, otherwise they wouldn't be able to play 60 competitive matches per year. But because of the money everyone directly involved is closing their eyes. 
1 WE ARE ALL ON PEDS ARGHHHHHH
1 I live in southern missouri so it definitely ignited my love of baseball at a young age. 
1 [I knew you'd come crawling back!](https://media.giphy.com/media/TtNEvVmvZedu8/giphy.gif)
1 Wash up CFB/NFL/CFL players allowed to become the Xtreme Fun League? Sounds good.
1 Unless he is on the back of a tandem bike. 
1 Or a ex-Lax
1 Not the worst thing to take when going for a ride, apparently:"Viagra is not on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned list, meaning no athlete caught taking the drug will have committed a violation, but there are calls for it to be banned given its ability to increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles."
1 That vasodilation though.
1 Actually they do take that lol. Helps with cardio. 
1 It's to give the rider a sense of pride and accomplishment for completing the racer in under 4 hours!
1 In all seriousness, this is something athletes have done. Viagra doesn’t necessarily give you a hard-on if you are super focused on something non-sexual, and it greatly increases circulation (not just to your dick).
1 I mean... In a way, Biff kinda is in charge
1 That's exactly where we are, bro. Now you know why such an idea came to be inside your noggin'. You live in the alternate 1985, we all do!
1 Hell, this would be an olympics i'd wanna be in lol
22 That's why you have a drug dealer doing post interviews after each stage.
7 I think thats a sweet guessing game though. 
1 Going off this comment alone, I'm guessing we should be friends 
1 Well that's the fun of the gambling. 
1 There should be a set pool of drugs, probably. Just announce the full list after everyone took them but before they kick in.
1 You're gonna stand there, ownin' a drug stand, and tell me you don't have no whistlin' bungholes, no spleen splitters, whisker biscuits, honkey lighters, hoosker doos, hoosker don'ts, cherry bombs, nipsy daisers, with or without the scooter stick, or one single whistlin' kitty chaser?
5 No, all bears. They just do bear things and maul the staff for medals.
1 Meh screw "randomized"... lets just go outright fixed... do research find out what countries hate eachother the  most, and pair them up.Next up in figure skating... it's the Isreal and palisine.
1 Dam Robel Kieros did better than expected, he was kinda fat but his starting technique was not bad at all.
1 Thanks, will look for it. 
1 THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
1 Yes that's the story as I've always known it. I believe someone came out a few years ago claiming this story of the Russians having a doping plan and that that's the real reason they boycotted the games. I have no knowledge of the validity of those claims, just that they are out there. I believe it was because of the political reasons as you say.
1 >The original Greek Olympics were probably very similar, Well, originallt it was quite the opposite. The Ancient Olympics was intended to foster cooperation between the usually rivalrous and warring city states, and was also an important religious event. It was supposed to be a time of peace, when celebrations for Zeus were held, and wars were even [momentarily stopped](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Truce) to make this possible). However, it eventually became highly politicized - *far* more than the modern version. City states would make declarations, form alliances, negotiated trade, etc with the backdrop of sport. It's kind of like, if today, we fused ESPN (when it was good) and the U.N.  (into one).
1 I just realized how little I know about the original Olympics, and probably how little the average person probably knows of it. Know what I'll be reading about tonight if I find the time.
8 To mention Canada, Greece, and Russia in the same sentence is an insult to Canada. Canada is a shining beacon. Its easily in the top five most desirable countries to live in.
10 I wouldn't really go so far as to say the US is "far and away the best country on Earth" either. Every country has their problems, but I'd say Canada, Iceland, Japan, maybe Sweden are at least in the running if not at the top. 
4 > [11.3 percent](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/11/the-number-of-americans-without-health-insurance-rose-in-first-quarter-2017.html) without access to adequate health care.> Far and away the best country on earth to live in.Not too sure there. America obviously has a lot going for it, is generally an amazing place to live and is lightyears ahead of a huge swathe of the planet but it's not far and away the best.
6 Well there's not gay concentration camps in Detroit, so "close" seems like a bit of a stretch. Detroit's reputation as a shithole is largely a dated and somewhat unfair stereotype.And most of the US is nice enough too, so for point of comparison we're mostly looking at the worst/most influential parts of each society, where Russia far and away leads (in a bad sense, I should clarify) over the US.
1 I don't like Putin, I think he's a very dangerous man who has too little empathy for my taste, I don't like the whole russian troll farm thing either, but I'm not going to blame it on every russian. I'd rather have a world where people got along regardless of country.I don't think people hate all russians, just Russian foreign policy and the messing with social media business. I hope the people of Russia don't think we hate them all :/ <3
1 Americans don't hate the Russian people. I think we see them as backwards as the rest of the world sees us. Not in custom, but in apathy for liberty. There was never a people so downtrodden as the Russians. And there was never a population so arrogant as the Russians until America. 
1 Well if this is true then it's a lot worse than that:https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/russian-sites-call-hiv-a-myth-western-conspiracy-an-epidemic-is-now-exploding/I also watched a documentary about dragqueens in Russia where they interviewed people saying that several of their close friends had just "gone missing" from one day to the next and was never heard from again. Doesn't sound good to me :/ There are gay ducks, gay whales, gay lions etc etc. It's just a thing that happens in nature. Why discriminate? That's the part I don't get. Is Putin bisexual or and upset about it or...
1 Just some light oppression against a minority. Nothing to see here, folks. 
29 Getting zesty in here.
1 That made me giggle
6 What even is edging?
13 The ending makes the whole ordeal worthwhile. I've never read something where the stakes are so high as the end-of-the-world battle with massively OP magical powers and the literal battle of Gods. Do it for yourself and finish what you started.
6 Yes. 100 percent. Book 10 is probably the worst. The series ends very strong. 
4 You made it through the worst.  Lord knows I skipped a chapter or two.  The last books are everything you could want them to be.  Really good shit. 
2 You have to pick them back up, the last 3 books are great.  Push through it, it is worth it.
2 People enjoy what they enjoy, so only you can say if it is worth it...but it's worth it.Try the audiobooks, if you are not into reading them.

3 If the whole society collapsed a new society that is even more dupable would rise from the ashes.

36 [**Whataboutism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument,[1][2][3] which **is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.**[4][5][6] When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be "What about..." followed by an event in the Western world.[7][8][9]

1 *When the Fox News host said, “Putin’s a killer,” the President Trump responded by saying: “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. [What, you think our country is so innocent?](http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/02/04/preview-bill-oreilly-donald-trump-super-bowl-interview)“*
-19 No, there's always a deluge of comments trying to persuade you people to get some fucking perspective.
1 Its still hypocritical if one hegemonical nation guilty of overthrowing more states than ever, starting the most recent wars and invasions in modern times, and a very expansive nato policy (USA and Nato used to be pretty much a synonyme) tries to say that Russia is bad and you cant just invade.  Yes its reasonable to say that. But it has almost no substance. The only reason why US can get away with that, and Russia cant: Money. US is still the richest country on earth and a huge economy. Russia is a regional power with Nukes. However the US tries to keep its one sided hegemony and make Russia and China stay Regional Powers.
-1 I thought the reference was to Edward Snowden...
-1 Functionally, whistle blowing is either ineffective, or a crime. You either bring the story to WaPo/NYT/CNN or you report it to your superiors and are demoted/dismissed/made redundant, and nothing happens. 
1 Oh yeah I'm sure Snowden would have gotten a real great outcome if he'd stayed in the US /s
-11 Wtf do his parent's opinion have to do with anything? Are they both lead investigators? Were they there? Who gives a shit what they think.
5 I wouldn't say it was intentional, necessarily, but he damaged the reputation of the US government, which is very much Russia's goal right now, judging by this whole election debacle. 
-6 > Also, in the past Obama gave Manning clemency. So let's not pretend both countries are the same in this respect.Right, because giving clemency to one person definitely changes the overall policy. If it thinks that you are a threat to any part of its dominance in the world, the USA will hunt you and it will kill you. Without anything resembling rule of law. The US even openly assassinates its own citizens without warrant or trial.
-7 Doesn't make it right though. 
-3 I'll educate you: Russia has a moratorium on capital punishment for about twenty years now.
-4 1862.[But it's still a part of our laws today.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) Just because we haven't in the past 150+ years doesn't mean someone could go against that precedent.
-3 > You don't have to establish that U.S. policy is innocent to state that Russian politics is far more fucked up.But you do have to ignore the hundreds of thousands/millions of Arabs/South Americans killed in aggressive wars of conquest that the US constantly engages in. Russia's problems are mostly internal which, for me anyway, is far preferable to murdering people powerless to stop you all over the world. There are no saints in this conversation, and if you're talking specifically and only about the treatment of whistleblowers, then yes Russian public policy is worse than the US one.
-1 Russia is a atrocious, I couldn't agree more. And possibly trying to compare the too directly is inappropriate. However hopefully we don't use Russia being as bad as they are as a shield for the infractions by our own governments.And tbf the cituation in gauntanamo was greatly improved under Obama cutting down to only about 50 prisoner from nearly 500. However of almost 800 prisoner that entered gauntanamo most were never found of legal wrong doing.
1 What
-1 > It's nice to see you have a job as a Russian troll on Reddit. What does that pay?Still don't know. No one was able to point out who should I ask for payment. I think there is quite a sum right now. Payment is long overdue. I've been doing that on reddit for years now. 
0 no, not at all. i was only referring to a lifetime prison sentence and 40 years would do it for me. like how most of the people stuck in a SuperMax prison are there on a 1 way ticket. 
1 Ayahuasca 
1 If the only 'facts' you know are delivered to you by a biased party, your ignorance cant be considered willful. Many cultures do not foster skepticism from youth, and even in the west there is heavy pressure to conform. Can you imagine if you were lied to your entire life by the only source of 'truth' in society? Your idea if reality is going to be shaped by those lies.
1 He did mention murder though 
1 > My imperfections include failing to be "kind" or "humble", at times, Make that often.Smh, what a judgemental load of bullshit.
1 Define completely delusional and how you get to that place.  
1 Implying no one is perfect or brought up from perfect beings, and everyone is susceptible.  Your own words are ignorant, and that is what you're complaining about.
1 And some people have less of a chance than others.  Some people have pride, some are just lied to their whole life.  It's too complex for me to just treat another person as subhuman.
1 How do you think that would've gone if the court was full of homophobic bigots?
1 What? Governments use intelligence services to promote their own agenda, work against other's agendas, and mislead foreign policy makers when necessary?That's a given. Literally everyone does it and it'd be dumb not to, but the Russians (and even the British to a lesser extent) mix them into an official channel making sure that there's no distinction. The relative independence of the US media means that there's an editorial filter in place that mitigates it.Hell, the Wall Street Journal prints the "China Watch" section that's written by the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. I would argue that they publish at least as much Chinese Propaganda as they do US Propaganda at this point.
4 Lol the fucking Senate just passed a bill draft literally handwritten by lobbyists. There are so many malfunctions in the political apparatus right now it would be a miracle if the state survives three more decades
1 I hope you're right, man. 
4 If only the Olympics had an established set of rules and testing procedures that regulate what substances athletes are and are not allowed to use in order to participate. Something like that could work.
13 They might spend. But the fact that it didn’t work disproves your statement.
0 And doesn’t *this* prove that that doesn’t necessarily work? You’re fighting against your own argument here. 
1 Yeah I was just reading about the report. Apparently it was an orchestrated effort including over 1000 athletes. I’m very happy that the IOC finally found out about this and is making it clear that it won’t be tolerated.
1 I wanted a sports car, not no walking trash can!
6 First of all I'm not religious and I don't believe pride is a sin, especially if you apply context, which you don't even have. Which makes me really think why you even made this comment. You don't know what country I'm from, you don't know who I am, or what I've experienced. I'm proud that my country cares about its citizens, that my military involves itself to protect the betterment of my home and I'm damn proud to be my fathers son. So take your cynical bullshit back to your moms basement where you're typing this from. It's clear that you've done and plan on doing nothing meaningful in your life. 
7 When you ask the questions,>Why should anyone have pride in a country that systematically does bad things? >What the hell are you even proud about?you're clearly asking rhetorical questions. 
1 I guarantee you none of those athletes are gearing up for the Olympics thinking 'for Trump!' 'for Putin' etc. They are going in to do their families, friends, and all peoples of the nation proud.  
1  The vast majority of elite athletes from any country have used performance enhancing drugs. It's so ridiculous to me, as someone who has competed, has used steroids, and has trained with people who both have and haven't used drugs when people actually believe the average elite athlete is clean. The volume of training alone that athletes perform can't be maintained without performance enhancing drugs. And then even without being on drugs at the moment, many give you benefits long after you're off of them. I used to be skinny and lanky. Now, even after a couple years off of steroids, I don't even need to lift and I'd be stronger than probably most people who lift regularly. I could pass any drug test you gave me though. I know people who did steroids in high school for sports. In at least a couple cases, they wouldn't be some random fringe case, it would be a large amount of their team. I've had coworkers tell me about the designer steroids and prohormones they used to use when they were younger. This shit is so common at the low level of competitive sports, and people really think elite athletes who depend on winning for their income aren't using anything? 
1 And if the vast majority of athletes doping was unique to Russia I would agree. But it is a world wide problem. Everyone is in drugs. If you have positive test from those people ban them. If you don't let them compete. If the testing is adequate what is the problem? They will be caught if they are using. To be clear. I am 100% sure they are using. I am just 100% sure the Americans, the English the Turkish, the Iraqis the Congolese, everyone is using. There are individuals who aren't obviously but the vast majority of winners are.I don't see why Russians should have to prove themselves when we know everyone is doing it anyway.Lets take Usain Bolt as an example. We all love the guy. But lets face it, he is using. The chances he is clean are next to nothing. But no one calls him out even though we are fairly certain he is using performance enhancing drugs. When he fails a drug test we will treat him like lance but until then we will all ignore it. I just don't know why I should treat the Russians any different to Usain Bolt. I know they are using, I just don't have that test result.
4 Olympic people said, if NHL pulls out, then even if Ovechkin wants to play, he still can't participate. Ovechkin already issued a statement saying that if he was allowed by Olympic Federation to play he would, but Russian Team literally can't even invite him, nhl will be not participating as a whole. 
3 This is untrue. He did have permission from his owner, but he's made a statement that he's not going to challenge the NHL decision
2 Gotta admit I didn't know that, interesting to see it wasn't simply all of the NHL players not being present.
1 Agreed. 
1 I'm not so sure Russians would put causes over wellbeing if they had the choice. Crimea probably wasn't even a cause 15 years ago?
1 Just look at their history and how oligarchs established control.
1 You guys are naive. Journalist have committed "suicide" or just disappeared over there. You really think they would allow that shit to go on? Do you remember what happened in Ukraine recently and how there people literally ran and hid in the church? Also as long as the rich and are still rich and the middle is complacent there's never gonna be any real change.
1 And what's the alternative? Anarchy, like in the 1990's? We've had enough revolutions in the last 100 years and we don't need more.
-1 ah yes because putin really cares how his country looks, out of everything he could possibly do it makes complete sense that he just decides to dope some Olympiads.
1 the point is what is popular and what is a good idea for Russia long term are not necessarily the same thing, it's going to be bad long term for Russia that they now have a reputation as a rogue state. 
1 he might not be the greatest president, but he’s a hell of a buisness man. god knows you don’t need to be a genius to buy and sell
3 US ADA is well funded, independent from the political state, and quite thorough with testing and results.  The hard drives that were smuggled out of russia really painted a picture of complete state capture and control of the russian ADA.So again, russia is an organized nest of cheaters who are organized and directed from the very tip of national politics.  America undoubtedly doesn't catch every single athlete who attempts to cheat, but they actually go about their work systematically and honestly. The programs are night and day.  And russia deserves every bit of this punishment.  Frankly, they should be banned until putin isn't dictator anymore.
1 Actually the article says Russian athletes must be given clearance by the IOC... Reading skills motherfucker, do you have them?But let's go with your assumption. Source on Russian figure skaters being clean?
1 Ah so it just stopped at the coaches? Oh okay i see. /s
1 I don't believe you do. If someone like can Lance Armstrong can go years doing it and dominate in a sport that is truly humanly impossible to do without doping then there's zero hope. It's normal and we must all go in knowing that. 
1 > What a totally immature reaction to what I said.What on earth are you talking about? Russia has been banned from the Olympics and here you are sitting crying "What about USA?!" How else should I interpret it? You think its terribly unfair that Russia has been banned while America hasn't. Well here's the thing, you *literally* cannot produce evidence of any wrong doing on America's part.  What do you propose we do then? Allow Russia who we *know* cheats to compete, because you *think* America might cheat as well?> Seriously dude. Why do you talk about something you know fuck all about?> Here's a little wiki page about it. Wow, a list of American athletes who have been caught for cheating. Do you have trouble concentrating or something? No one has denied some American athletes cheat. And you realize a ton of those people aren't Olympic athletes right? We're talking about whether American Olympic bodies are helping and encouraging cheating. Take a couple deep breaths, and try to muster up what little concentration you have and actually respond to the points I brought up in my last post. You're not a terribly good advocate for the Russian side.
1 Well to be able to make a claim like "90% of them are on it" you need to actually do some research, dude.
1 You should've just typed 'No you!' Would've been less words to make the same point. Idiot.
1 That reminds me, I need to see that.
1 One of the greatest moments in sports history was a team of college kids beating Russian professionals.  But sure...no chance against finnish/swedish pros lol...  OP is also forgetting the best players from those countries aren't going to be eligible because they play in AHL/NHL too.
1 Yeah, it will be fun to watch I always love the juniors, but for a quick idea, I looked up last years roster for the world juniors and literally the entire team had already been drafted lmao :(
2 Yes, that's what I want, as I stated.  A return to the pre-professional athlete Olympics.  YOU want the best vs the best, as you've already stated.  Others may want the same as you, or the same as me, or something different.  We don't get to assume THEY want what WE want just because we want it.
1 Should also note that a majority of the players in the NHL *DO NOT* go to The Olympics which puts the NHLPA in a bind to be okay with not going to The Olympics. It's not like the players not going are saying they others can't go but as said, the NHLPA isn't gonna give up anything to attend either.
1 Yeah, I was more referring to how non-American sports associations are not as entitled as the US ones are.It's the Winter Olympics; there's a hundred different events and they all have athletes competing that take breaks from regularly scheduled tournaments/leagues to participate. That's what the Olympics is about. 
1 Clearly, the NHL needs more free media exposure in Canada so that more Canadians can learn about the sport of hockey and start watching the NHL.
1 Yes, Canadians like hockey a lot, but this was the top television broadcast in the history of the country. That's a big deal even when the baseline is quite high.
1 > I was saying that if the IOC gets the benefits but not the costs it's unfair for the NOCs, and it could eat up a lot of the budget for smaller countries.Actually it seems like the NOC gets a lot of money from the IOC. Anyway, the two can't really be separated. You're talking like the IOC is some kind of hostile company holding on to money that's not theirs.>Under the terms of the new agreement, the USOC is guaranteed seven percent of the U.S. broadcast revenue and 10 percent of the IOC’s global sponsorship revenue.That's certainly generous.>I'm surprised that that they still didn't think it was worth paying, or did it fall through because the IOC negotiates directly with the NHL?I really don't understand why the NHL would talk directly to the IOC, that's not their place.>I have to imagine the Canadian Olympic Comitee would have been pushing really hard to get a deal done.Why? The COC can only benefit by americans not attending the games.
1 > Also, since hockey is the most watchedSource? I don't even have the slightest idea why you would assume that.> the most for advertising prices when it's airedAdvertising? WTF would the IOC care about that? >It also generates the most sponsor money since it's most viewed.Source? >Advance notice: I'm not wasting anymore time on this. Look it up yourself. It's all there.So ... the source is your ass then. MURICA', fuck yeah! Right?
1 Why is it not a replacement? I prefer it honestly. It airs in the time zone I live in, it doesn’t have garbage teams, and it doesn’t stop the season in the middle of the year. 
3 Do the teams have to foot the bill?
21 So contracts are only valid unless it's a real big deal, then it's okay to bail on them, seems reasonable, that could never be abused.
13 And how do the owners get paid back for the money they aren't making during the regular season?Who pays back the owners when players get hurt and their good team suddenly isn't as good?
2 Except that isn't how it works. People forget that these are business. The league pays millions and millions for the players to go and gets nothing in return. You give me money for your car so I can drive it for 3 weeks. I'll crash it and give it back to you and you have to pay to fix it while not having a car which you need for work so now you're not getting money that way. Does that sound fair? Because it is no different than this situation. 
7 They do, majority of them are pissed off about this 
1 It's not regardless of the money. They could certainly break their contracts and play in the Olympics... they'd just lose a lot of money. So they're making exactly the same financial decision as the NHL -- they don't want to lose the money from their NHL contracts.
2 Don't you think NHL teams want to protect their investments? It doesn't matter what the players want or how any of this makes them feel, the commenter above said all that needs to be said: young star players are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the NHL has very little to gain from allowing them to go. 
13 Yes, I do. Do you remember Dominic Hasek in 2005? He was having a great season on a very good team.He went to play in the Olympics.He got hurt, and missed the rest of the season.Do you even watch hockey?At the start of the next season, he was released.
3 Except for all the problems they've had, they've had no problems!
1 It’s only a competition if both sides find winning more entertaining than losing. The very best find entertainment in beating themselves. The Olympics today are about money. Winning the games, winning the competition themselves draws value. Russia systematically cheated, that’s tremendously different than individuals undertaking individual efforts to cheat to win.
1 I disagree. Read through this thread from that time for examples of how exciting it was:https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/53fo97/post_game_thread_team_north_america_vs_finland/edit: here's another onehttps://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/53voeo/post_game_thread_north_america_at_sweden_21_sep/
2 Oh yeah I'm still definitely going to watch, I just wish I could have seen Gaudreau-Matthews-Eichel fight their way to a silver medal, is all.
1 I wonder what the ratio is, considering a lot of players have a lot of natural height and reach which is advantageous.
1 I have a feeling primarily in first or second year players that they're trying to bulk up. Lanky bigs get knocked over too easily.
1 Yeah, I'm with you on that.  Why can't we allow the doping?  Let em do it.
1 Damn, I would have thought that not to be the case.  Now that you mention it, it having so much money tied up in it, I can see how they would go laxed on regulations.
1 Or the front ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
1 On the back butt inside of the front. 
1 Oh. Oh dear god. Holy shit. 
7 hahahaha now that's a great idea
1 Sounds good to me, drugs are better with friends after all ;)
1 Good idea, maybe you get the best odds if you bet before the full list is announced, odds get a bit worse after the list is announced, and then when shit starts to kick in the odds get progressively worse
1 [I got u.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgqbCq_sxmo)
1 It's Super Effective to earn medals that way
1 Maybe if every country had to do olympic events with countries they hated, the world would be a different place.
1 > palisinewut

1 Well, something like that happened once: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_in_the_Water_match
1 Your buying into the stereotyping without much more thought. Having lived in Canada my entire life, I can safely say there are so many government antics that are just fucking stupid
3 Does not excuse the corruption it has though. Because Canada has better living condition doen not mean it gets a free pass.
1 I'm an American and I would love to move to Canada. Canada is like America's nicer, smarter, more sensible brother. And they have a much better national anthem.
7 Singapore, Luxembourg, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria are all in the running too.
1 >JapanI wouldn't really say Japan is all that great, it has a horrible work culture.You should rather add all the Scandinavian countries, they all seem relatively great to live in.
1 Even in Canada, we're facing major brain drain because educated professionals (especially those in tech) want to move to the US for better opportunities and salaries. There's no clear "best" place on Earth, IMO. The US is among the best if you are educated, but among the worst if you're poor (at least between developed nations, it's still much better than developing countries). 
6 Basically pretty much any medium sized relatively wealthy country is ludicrously better to live in than the US.
1 True, most of Detroit's sterotypes had to move to Flynt. Shit, that sounds insensitive and kind of... racial? I meant the peasant class. Poor people.
1 There are also no gay concentration camps in Kursk, what is your point?Russia has more bad places, but not by enough to matter very much. And the median is marginally worse, which is more significant.
1 > I don't like PutinI don't like him either. He is still best ruler Russia probably ever have. Rest were much worse.> I hope the people of Russia don't think we hate them allNobody really cares. There is small percentage that cares about Western opinion, but like most with external locus of control they are quite unhappy. Otherwise I don't quite remember any particular personal hate or whatever towards those american students I've seen. 
3 just wait until I unzip the grapefruit
1 What you do while the site loads
1 As a big time WoT-fan myself I suggest some Warhammer 40000 for a new definition of the word Epic.
1 I agree with this. It was a slog. But damn if Mr. Sanderson didn't do the Last Battle justice.
1 I mean, with how long that series is and how much fluff is in the writing at some points, theres no way to avoid that. Def skipped a few chapters during my read. 
1 ......read his username.
13 Ah, yes. Because as US citizens we have no right to point out wrongs in the world.It's almost like we can disagree with our governments actions while also disagreeing with foreign governments actions. 
0 People in this sub are fucking hilarious when it comes to Russia, US/Trump. You'll get the one side who wants to be full anti-Russia and nothing else, one side will tell you the US and Russia aren't that bad, and then one minor side will tell you Trump is literally worse than Putin which is laughable then a side of people argue about Obama and whistleblowers. Then you got the delusional redditors crying about whataboutism. Every thread is like this. You won't find a reasonable middle ground. Both of these nations are complete disasters when it comes to whistleblowers and international politics and there's nothing wrong about saying that. Is Russia worse? Yeah I would say so, but we Americans have our own problems since the Bush administration regards to whistleblowers.
1 Most recent invasion? You do know that Russia has launched [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_\(2014%E2%80%93present\)) [invasions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) since the U.S. invaded Iraq, right? Regardless, the most recent invasion was [Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana invading the Gambia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%932017_Gambian_constitutional_crisis)
7 Neither of them or the pair combined is still anywhere close to Russia's treatment of domestic whistleblowers.
1 Edward Snowden has not been arrested, tried, or jailed. It is therefore useful to examine the treatment of a whistleblower who has. I know random, wild speculation is more convenient for your whataboutism, but the rest of us like actual examples.
3 If we ignore all the cases where whistleblowing was effective and wasn't a crime then yes, you're right.Are you really suggesting that leaking classified info should be legal?  Are you a serious person?I don't like whistleblowers going to prison when the stuff they gave up was in the public interest but it's not like you could just make divulging of classified info a misdemeanor without terrible implications.  Have you thought about this, at all?
1 > Oh yeah I'm sure Snowden would have gotten a real great outcome if he'd stayed in the US /sAre you really comparing assassination with a trial and punishment?  Manning was commuted and released.
8 Everything you just said is equally applied to yourself you idiot.
3 Ok, fine. So by your own logic what "lead investigators" are providing evidence that there was a conspiracy? What official or eye witness testimony would lead you to believe that something political was behind his murder?Or is there not any of that and you are just pushing a political agenda?
5 Obviously they were in on it!!!! Lol
1 The investigators and journalists didn't find anything either champ.
7 It's still misleading to say he acted in their interests.IMO (and according to Snowden), he acted in the interest of the people of the US, and then their allies and the world at large, because what the US government was doing he deemed immoral and illegal etc.That doing so ended up weakening the US' position on the global stage may have helped Russia in a zero-sum sense, but I wouldn't say that Snowden acted in their interests. He still acted separately.
1 I know Trump has said that he wants people like Snowden dead, but I don't think he'd be allowed to have him killed. 
7 I think you're entirely missing the point of what I said. Maybe you missed the edit.
1  The United States doesn't kill people for treason anymore... Educate yourself. Tell me when the last person convicted of treason was killed in the United States. Go back to r/russia kid. 
5 They just [poison people with polonium instead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko)
1 What do you get out of conducting absurd mental gymnastics in order to make the United States out to be the great Satan? Is it money?
4 If you care so much about human rights, why insist on derailing a thread about corruption and human rights abuses to completely unrelated problems in different countries? Whataboutism is a lazy transparent attempt to shift the narrative. I don't go into threads about Gitmo to deflect to Duetre and the Phillipeans. 
3 Ah okay.  I was mainly curious because some of the thinly-veiled examples being used by some people are US military personnel who have spent single-digit years in solitary, but I'm not personally aware of any american whistleblowers who have spent an entire life sentence in solitary for their whistleblowing.
1 After an experience like that she will be able to see through both the russian and western propaganda 
1 Here’s the thing: I was raised by evangelical young earth creationists. I was brainwashed by anti-science and fundamentally religious people for my entire young life. I’m *still* undoing that almost two decades after leaving it. I am fully aware of what it sounds like on the other side and how good they are at captivating their audience.I am also at least fairly intelligent and realized that I was being fed bullshit. I was smart enough to say “hmm, what if that’s not true” and that question was enough to make me investigate the truth.You are willfully ignorant if you only get news from one side because other sides are out there; either you choose to be lazy or you choose to be knowledgeable, in this case there aren’t any gray areas.
1 Everyone who has posted on /r/the_donald without getting banned is a good starting point.I have _no idea_ how anyone gets to that place, though.
1 Probably the same as it did, as SCOTUS and all judges put their personal beliefs aside and rule on the law solely or risk being impeached
5 And how many things has Trump actually accomplished? How many injunctions have taken place? The United States will survive. All that rhetoric is just fear mongering.
1 Oh, but then we couldn't further punish nations we're at odds with. 
15 it didnt work because the head of their doping program jumped ship and blew the whistle on everyone
3 My point is that they're still going to try.
3 My argument is they're still going to try the same shit, given the chance.
1 I can agree with that.Though it's still bizarre to me. You are the best, you complete in the Olympics, you should be proud. Not for your country, not for anything, but for your personal struggle and achievement.I really struggle to grasp how the Olympiad turned to political.
1 We should treat them differently because no other country has been found to have had such an extensive, systematic program of cheating. There is no way the Americans, or just about anybody else for that matter, are cheating WADA to the extent the Russians have been, especially in Sochi. They were using actual FSB agents to falsify the samples; it's insane.
1 C'mon, let a guy dream. 
1 Can Russians vote "none of the above"? I'd like to see Russian campaigning for candidate "none of those guys".
1 That's exactly the Putin's strategy. Drive Russia to the edge of the cliff and then shout "Don't move or we are all going down!" 
1 The alternative is an actual representative government with a stronger rule of law, stronger institutions, way less corruption, real freedom of speech and a more diverse, resilient economy. You really can't overstate the importance of simple things like rule of law and freedom of speech. Same with having a reasonable expectation for fair (or at least not rigged) elections. Corruption at every level of government makes it hard to do business as well, and it makes foreign investment a risky proposition at best. Things could be so, **so** much better for the Russian people and there's only one person standing in the way. Removing Putin and his fellow scum may not fix everything, but it would certainly be a good first step.
2 Yes, it does make sense...Re-read your own post. Is it not perfectly reasonable, plausible, and sensible to you?
1 What was the alternative from the perspective of a Russian?  Continue down the path of western integration? That failed them clearly by 97 when the average Russian was living beneath poverty had seen a wage drop and was dying 7 years sooner? Again you can’t look at what’s going on now and apply it to what’s happened to get here. The history of it suggests Russia was never going to be close to the west now. It was a failed endeavor with a break point centered in the 96 election which should have been won by Zyuganov (which likely would not have been any better for Russia at the time but almost certainly would have blocked someone like Putin from attaining power). Fixing it now is a much bigger task than simply expecting Putin and Russia to suddenly uphold our western values. 
1 https://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/2006_annual_report.pdfIf you look on page 20, 8 million from their 12 million budget comes from US federal grants, and another 4 million comes from the US olympic committee.   If you change the date in the link to 2015, it still is overwhelming federal.I'm not trying to say there is sufficient evidence to say that US is on the same footing as Russia but, from a variety of stats and data points, it seems like there may be more than pedantic details left in such a story.Additionally, I'm not trying to wheedle that everyone is equally terrible, therefore accept it.If I had to run under a banner (please don't make me), it would probably be "Finding outanything to a honest degree is really hard work and is both intentionally and unintentionally obscured by the people involved."
1 For fucks sake dude. Why are you being such a prick because I asked for a source? 
1 You wanna send me all your valuable info about other countries' governments being involved? Or is it just speculation?
1 Ugh that's depressing. Yeah I guess the Olympics, as is now,  won't be able to get at from it.Maybe I'll just form a new international sports event, entirely lottery and people who are the best aren't allowed to come. That'll show them. 
1 No I'm talking about the majority of other countries if you'd even cared to read and put down your sirens. I chose the US to show it's close to home. You would have just agreed with me if I said Jamaica or Kenya or whatever. The way you are trying to bend the argument to suit yourself is truly fucking embarrassing. I am in no way advocating the 'Russian side'. Just because someone is pointing out someone else does something doesn't you are saying it's okay or that you are defending the original culprit. Again, embarrassing. It's not one side or the other. There are multiple sides but there was to be just two then it would be doping vs anti doping. I am CLEARLY on one of those sides. You are just running around trying to twist and turn rather than stay on point. If anyone needs to concentrate it's you. In an argument or discussion you need to stay in line and on that point or you are just expanding an argument you will never come to a conclusion of. 
1 So you're a child who thinks insults "wins" arguments? How pathetic.
1 Of course. But from the NHL point of view it was a situation where no one was willing to negotiate with them. (except the IIHF who had nothing to offer) If no one else is willing to give anything at all to get what they want why should the NHL give something to get something they don't want. 
1 Yeah, I hear the luge league really takes a financial hit every four years to allow their players to go to the Olympics. You are comparing apples to oranges. Those non-American leagues don't act as "entitled" because they are orders of magnitude smaller. 
1 One might argue the entitled one is the IOC.
1 Ya, You are a right. The country in which the sport is most popular needs more exposure to that sport.
1 The NHL only cares about viewership of Olympic hockey to the extent that it impacts viewership of NHL games.  Every man, woman, and child on Earth could drop everything and tune in for the gold medal match but that won't do the NHL a bit of good unless a significant number of them decide to tune in to the NHL once the Olympics are over.To the extent that NHL viewership can be improved in Canada, I don't think more exposure is what is needed.  A Canadian being unexposed to hockey is as silly to imagine as a Brazilian unexposed to soccer or an American unexposed to football.
1 Yeah, I was mistaken on how the money distribution worked. And why wouldn't the NHL talk with the IOC? The IOC wants their players for the Olympics, who else would they talk to? (I know the IIHF is involved in the talks, but they don't have a ton of leverage).>Why? The COC can only benefit by americans not attending the gamesUh, for starters because the NHL is about half Canadian players and if the NHL doesn't go then Canada is picking up scraps from juniors or the euro leagues. And because hockey is huge in Canada and everyone wants the best players to be there? Like 2/3rds of the country watched the 2010 gold medal final and almost half for Sochi (at 6am). Sure, if the US didn't go then Canada might have an easier time going for gold, but any reasons that would prevent the US for going would probably exist for Canada, too. 
1 [deleted]
1 > It airs in the time zone I live inI actually kind of like having a reason to get up and drink at 6am once ever 4 years.>it doesn’t have garbage teamsSure some teams don't stand a chance of winning gold but I am sure the players enjoy representing their home country and getting to hang out with the other players of said country. >it doesn’t stop the season in the middle of the year.The season stops for the All-Star game every year which is a hot pile of garbage.
1 I think they do get compensated in case of injury, but other than that, yes.
1 You do know that the NHL has been in multiple Olympics already, right?
1 Not enough that they're willing to walk away from their contracts though.
1 That was also Haseks 26th year playing professionally, he was like 45 if you think they would’ve kept him for a number of years after your crazy his time was up irregardless 
0 I don’t feel like arguing on reddit anymore, agree to disagree 
1 > I just wish I could have seen Gaudreau-Matthews-Eichel fight their way to a **silver** medal, is all.Oh god damn you.
1 It was easy with MLB cause you had rookie cards to compare too.But these kids are starting extremely young on cycles now.  So it's very hard to tell if it's genetics + having nutrionists + trainers early in their career, or if it's roids.

1 Because whatever form this sport takes it will suffer from problems identical to our current system- i.e. enforced with limits which athletes will constantly try to break/circumvent. Because whatever organization condones unregulated use in competitive events will be on the hook for any doping related health conditions/ deaths that will be caused by athletes trying to push the limits of their bodies in an environment that REQUIRES intense biomedical regimens to compete. This is ignoring the question of how a organization would even enforce limits on body modification. How do you determine how much dope is too much. How would you even test for that? As a fan of trans-humanism, I'm actually pro-body-modification in sports, but it presents a lot of ethical problems that need to be addressed.  
1 More aerodynamic that way.

1 Im Canadian, I'm not buying into any stereotype. Canadians have an essentially unrivaled quality of life. EVERY government has corruption, that does not mean that the entire country is a write off.
1 So what's your top 5?
1 Yeah exactly, you lived in Canada your entire life. Go spend a decade in a real shitshow and you will realize how good you have it in Canada.
1 Russia is to Chicago IL as Canada is to Montpelier VT when it comes to corruption... it just doesn't feel like a very meaningful comparison. In a thread about shining beacons of freedom for people to thrive, I wouldn't stick Canada in the same list as these other mentions.
1 In international rankings of corruption Canada is consistently top 5 least corrupt.
1 I love how Australia doesn't even get a mention when this topic comes up. https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/top-20-most-liveable-countries-un-human-development-index-2015/4/
1 Like I said, every country has their problems. Japan's work culture is definitely one of theirs. It's also got it's fair share of idiots pushing a revisionist history agenda. The fiscal deficit is in a far worse shape than the US. I certainly wouldn't definitively say it's better than the US, but in terms of other major topics (like healthcare and probably education) it ranks above the United States. Anecdotally, I've lived in both and I'd say the quality of life for the average citizen was probably about equal. 
1 > but among the worst if you're poorPerhaps among some subset of developed countries, *maaaaaaybe*.Being poor in the US and living on unemployment / social security / medicaid / food stamps still puts you as among the top 10% wealthiest people to ever live.... So among that top 10% (see: western countries) you might have a point. But compared to being poor in India or Vietnam? Not a chance.
1 Like I just said in another comment saying the same about Japan, I certainly didn't mean to say any of those are definitively better than the US, just that it's a lot closer than the American Exceptionalism crowd would like to admit. I'd definitely say your analysis of America's disparate wealth levels as accurate. It's probably among the worst if you're poor and best if you're rich. Getting back to the original point, I think one of the few places where that disparity is even greater is in Russia.
1 I feel like everyone here keeps swinging back and forth between extremes. America is neither the best nor worst in its bracket. Quality of life and governance in Russia and China is far worse than in the United States, and that was the original point. These definitely don't fit as medium sized, but neither does the US. But is life for an average American here far and away better than life for a German or Brit? No, probably not.
1 In Canada we have a massive brain-drain problem because people want to move to the US for better salaries (especially in tech). The US isn't the best country on Earth, but it's one of them, especially if you're an educated professional.
1 You were saying inner Detroit is close in quality of life to Chechnya. This is patently not true. And the median is not just marginally worse, [it's rather substantial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/03/19/russia-quality-of-life-indicators-worse-than-chinas/#60f70898571e)

1 I mean, Wheel of Time certainly meets the old definition of "Epic."
1 I only skim on rereads. I can't imagine skipping a chapter on my first read 
1 Read every. Single. Word. No regrets.
1 Well fuck.
-3 > Ah, yes. Because as US citizens we have no right to point out wrongs in the world.Not at all, just that you should consider starting with your own backyard, rather than pour your venom on someone else who is doing some things worse and some things better than you are. You bleat about having the best democracy in the world blah blah, so it should be straightforward to get your house in order.
2 Not sure what exactly you're seeing, but I see a ton of reasonable comments and speculation whenever this type of situation arises. Although I do agree that I see a lot of black and white thinking on this topic.
1 You're right. It's threads like these that usually trigger me to delete my Reddit account. It reminds me that I've once again slipped back into the cesspool that is this kind of discussion.> Both of these nations are complete disasters when it comes to whistleblowers and international politics and there's nothing wrong about saying that. Is Russia worse? Yeah I would say so, but we Americans have our own problems since the Bush administration regards to whistleblowers.Assuming you mean Russia is worse when it comes to whistleblowers, I agree with everything you've said here.
2 >leaking classified infoWhy should this be illegal by default, if the classified info being leaked is about illegal activities? For example, a war crime? We already give our soldiers the ability to reject illegal orders. I don't see why we can't extend that to anybody working in the government. 
1 > what "lead investigators" are providing evidence that there was a conspiracyLeft the bar at 130am, found shot in the back at 430am, shot twice in a 'robbery' only nothing was taken. Footage shows two people leaving the scene. Unless they both simultaneously robbed him and took nothing, they were, by definition, conspiring.
1 I would agree he wanted to help the people, but it's worth considering that the Russian government granted him asylum. That's not exactly insignificant.
-1 Obama openly assassinated four American citizens without warrant or trial because he felt pretty sure they were on the side of ISIS. Not because they actually represented anything even resembling imminent danger. He was the first US President to do this openly. I find it impossible to imagine that there are no clandestine assassinations.
-1 No they just ship them off to get tortured in secret prisons. 
1 No. I'm not out to Satan-ize anybody. Just stating the facts. I don't like it any more than you do, evidently.
1 And through good vibes
1 >as SCOTUS and all judges put their personal beliefs asidelol, okay.
1 bullshit. he's doing such things as * packing young, shitbag conservative judges into the federal court slots that that the GOP wouldn't let Obama appoint (remember, these are the courts that could "check and balance" all that initial bullshit like the travel ban).* selling off national parks, killing epa regulations, moving funding out of clean energy programs into *fucking coal*. the ecosystem doesn't give a shit if you elect a democrat next time, it just becomes less hospitable to farming and breathing and not-getting-cancer. * doing irrevocable damage to the image of America as a bastion of freedom or whatever, which sure, it didn't deserve, but to the average american who likes cheap trade goods and missile defense systems between their own country and nuclear powers, that's bad news.* it's not nothing that the GOP totally stands behind him. I mean at this point both the GOP and Trump have voiced support for a pedophile running for senate. It took more or less the entire country yelling daily for months before they gave up on killing Obamacare, and now they're backdooring anti-ACA stuff into the tax disaster. they live in an unrecognizable and malevolent world. but trump, as a republican, ends up rubber stamping their fuckery. Idk, were you expecting to wake up on Nov 9th with your life ruined? Trump *might* not be cunning enough to pull of some sort of autocratic heist, but it would hardly matter if he did. He's just the most blatant symptom of a terribly sick political system that's treating itself with 250 year old medicine. the country's been dying since Nixon.
2 Yes, but he blew the whistle not on bribery, but on physical falsification of samples by the host country's federal security agency.
1 and our point is they wont be able to succeed. therefore the ones that do compete ARE actually clean.
1 Yes country... as I have said, ban Russia and make the Russian athletes compete under a non Russian flag. But I don't see a need to place the restrictions on the athletes themselves for the reasons I have said. 
0 no, doping is easy to find out and a stupidly risky thing just to make your country look a little better, why would putin even try to make his country look better at this point, let alone with a few gold medals.
1 Again the alternative doesn't have to be cosy up, the alternative was don't invade sovereign nations or murder people, now Russia is basically going to exist under perpetual sanctions and resistance from the majority of the global economy, that was a big fuck up. 
1 I'm not saying its privately funded, I'm saying that its independent of state control, the feds give them plenty of money to do their jobs and dont ask for them to swap out dirty samples because comrade putin orders it.  They are also well funded enough that there is no drive to accept private monies in a quid pro quo.Russia is proven dirty in every way you can be.  They cheat, and the russian state orders supports and attempts to conceal the cheating. There is no whattabout america to it.  There is no equivalency of any form.  Russia is dirty as hell.  An organized russian operation including FSB agents operated in sochi to swap out dirty samples for clean ones.  There has never been an american scandal within a thousand miles of that.
1 You really are a precious kind of ignorant aren't you?
1 It's not an argument. You made a stupid statement and got called out on it. Shit happens. Get over it.
1 Buddy stop posting bullshit, you clearly don't know enough about this situation. The IIHF had nothing to offer? The IIHF explicitly stated it would cover everything that the IOC did not, and the NHL rejected that offer for fear over the fact that those funds would be stripped from the IIHF's "grass roots efforts," but only after it went to the NHLPA and offered them the ridiculous CBA option. And mind you, NHL's reason for rejecting the IIHF offer was based on nothing as the NHL didn't and doesn't have any clue about IIHF financing, nor is it their business to make a judgment call on behalf of the IIHF, but they did. 
1 I mean, if you can get an entire country to try your product and you can't convert any of them afterward, then you're either terrible at selling your product or you've reached saturation. I have to imagine there were some long-term positive effects on viewership, but it's of course difficult to measure. Your point is taken that saturation of the Canadian market is also possible.Even so, the Canadian exposure is just one example. That game was also the most-watched hockey broadcast in the US since the 1980 Olympics. Certainly there's a lot of room to grow in that market.
1 You sound like an american, thinking hockey is important and talking out of your ass.
1 Yeah, that's a bullshit arrangement.
2 Sure, and the NHL, as the owner of the contract, is allowed to make exceptions. They're not doing that anymore, and that's the point. Thanks for keeping up.
3 He won a Stanley Cup two seasons after that. With Detroit, remember?Yeah, you don't watch hockey.
2 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1972002-olympic-hockey-injuries-that-will-have-the-biggest-impact-when-the-nhl-returnsBefore you go, read this so you know how wrong you are.Have a nice day.
2 I mean, do you see anyone being able to beat Crosby-Mcdavid-Literally anyone?
1 It's pretty much all of that. Roids alone simply won't make you an elite athlete or look amazing. I'm no pro but I do use. Strict diet, a legitimate exercise plan, sleep, hydration etc are all part of it. I couldn't just pin test and tren and expect results if I half ass my work outs, diet etc. They are not this god's gift to athletes, you gotta work for it.
1 Well roids or no roids, having Greek freak limb length is a massive advantage when utilized properly.
1 If people want to play like Lebron they'll need the extra 20-30 pounds of muscle.
1 What's the issue with the limits?  Why do we even need them?  If people die in pursuit, that's fine!  Hell I would pay to see some 600 pound juggernaut's heart explode after he knocks put 3 other guys on a maddened rage.Already you need to train your entire life to hit the upper echelons of athleticism.  Let's not pretend like any of those people have any real appreciable, employable skills when they're done with their athletic careers.  Thousands of kids train their entire lives to hit the olympics, where only a small handful go.  What happens to the ones who don't make it?Why are we so sympathetic when it comes to drugs?  Do they kill you? Excellent, then I'm sure the best bioengineering teams will moderate their treatments to ensure their athletes have longer lives.  Or maybe another bioengineering group believes in maximum output over a short period... their athletes only play for 2 years.  Either way, these treatments take commitment and money, same shit it takes today to be a top athlete.We need to stop seeing doping as "cheating" and accept that we're just adding more intelligence into our sports.
1 Where do you stand on robotic legs?
1 everybody friend, friend
1 Our way of life is being measurably challenged by that corruption, but you would have me lie down because "Oh everywhere is corrupt, it's not that bad yet." Not taking into account, all evil needs to win, is for good men to do *nothing.* Our leaders are failing us, they aren't even partaking in open debate anymore, openly blindly answering questions without thought for the opposition's position or even playing at fairness. This government is failing Canadians in the name of his golden God "diversity".Edit: corrected leaders from ladders. Our ladders might be failing us, but I cannot blame that on parliament.
1 Precisely. Every country has corruption, and Canada's level of corruption is like a child selling candy bars in kindergarten without permission.
1 Then you haven't been paying attention. 
1 It's the dropbears. 
1 Yeah I didn't really mean that Japan is a horrible place to live. It just that you mostly trade some positive things in the US for some other positive things in Japan. Like you said your net gain regarding quality of life as the average citizen stays the same. Japan was just the easiest place to pick on for me, since I don't know enough about the deficits of the others you mentioned.I was mostly looking for something "better" than the US. For me that seems to be the Scandinavian countries, since they seem to have the healthcare, education and a fairly good work culture. 
1 I guess it depends on how you measure quality of life. 
1 Yes if you're already wealthy it's great, but the same goes for a bunch of truly shit countries too.
1 You are lying.
1 Have you read the WoT series?
1 Or, we could continue to point out all of the wrongs in the world and continue to work on the ones we can where we can.      Just because we're pointing out that *the Russian Federation is led by a murderous dictator who stole the power and wealth of the nation using KGB techniques and connections, such as murdering his opposition and arresting dissenters without courts independent of his power*, does not mean we're blind to the fact that *the United States of America is led by corrupt and cheap puppets controlled by a powerful corporate oligarchy made up of insiders*.        We're going to "spit venom" on the extra-judicial murders in the Philippines, we're going to spit venom on the People's Republic of China's human rights violations and their pacific aggression, we're going to spit venom on North Korean concentration camps and famine, we're going to spit venom on Congo slaver labor, of Islamic female genitalia mutilations, of Sudanese genocide, of the civil war in Yemen, of slavery and equal rights issues in Saudi Arabia, of the war in Syria.  We're going to spit venom and bleat about all of that shit!      You know why?  Because no matter what problems we have in the United States, we have two things: free speech and our guns.  We're going to keep running our dumb fucking mouths until we run out of breath, and if you try to stop us, we will defend ourselves.     Otherwise, fuck off to your favorite frozen wasteland and pray someone drops some sanctions so more ExxonMobil or Shell investment gets through. 
1 Overtime I see this kind of stuff but it variess what time of day too. Reasonable stances get downvoted a lot. It's like anything with Israel and Palestine, you'll get two extremes at different parts of the day. I can't tell if it gets better worse or to be honest. This  isn't too bad really, but I've seen worse.
1 > It's threads like these that usually trigger me to delete my Reddit account.[All right then.](https://i.imgur.com/64Ttugf.gif)
1 Yeah and they are worse. Doesn't matter what administration, Bush, Obama, Trump, Russia is significantly worse than we are. Yet it's so dishonest to sit here pat ourselves on the back about it like we don't have problems at home. There are more problems in our politics than just Trump, Russia and the Republican party. Again, are the Republicans worse than Democrats? Of course they are, yet do we pat our selves on the back knowing the Democrats fail to pass liberal legislations? Or when they purposely fight against progressive candidates?
1 > Why should this be illegal by default, if the classified info being leaked is about illegal activities?I agree in general theory that yeah there should be caveats put in place for this although in practice that's really hard to do.  How would the leaker establish the fact that illegal activities were being conducted prior to the leaking that would satisfy legal caveats?  If said illegal activities were established *after the leak* then the scenario just gets difficult if/when people *think* something is illegal but they are wrong.  What if a leak discloses illegal activity, and puts US personnel in harm's way or jeopardizes intelligence?  How would legislation handle this?That being said, leakers of classified info are still treated a great deal better in this country than in Russia when the classified info was useful to the public.   
1 So nothing. You have nothing other than your political instincts to tell you his murder was politically motivated. Good to know.
1 I dont remember that, who did Obama assassinate?
1 No they don't send people convicted of treason to secret prisons to torture them. Where do you make this nonsense up? I have to assume you are a Russian shill working on a PR campaign against the United States. When you decide to stop being an edgelord the real world is always waiting for you to educate yourself. 
1 not an argument
1 And how much of that stuff will be reversed after the Dems seize back control after 2018? This idea that the US is dying is laughable at best.
1 > no, doping is easy to find out and a stupidly risky thingYeah, so is hacking and social media brigading in a foreign country.> why would putin even try to make his country look better at this pointPutin does everything he can to convince his people that Mother Russia has immense power and influence. Olympic victories are obviously a good way to do this.
1 Your illogic is amusing. Wow. 😂
1 You think the IIHF has 10-20 million just laying around that they had no intention of putting into grass root programs? If the NHL assumptions where so wrong i am sure the IIHF would of opened up the books to the NHL to how that them paying would not take money away from grass roots programs. Also the NHL offer to the players was far from ridiculous. Extending the CBA and avoiding a lockout benefits everyone. The only reason the players said no is because they have every intention of going to another lockout.
1 I think it might honestly be a cultural thing aswell. Football is very much about national pride for both fans and players, and playing for your country is the highest honor imagineable. If a country calls upon one of its players, it's not even an argument: that player gets to play for his country (assuming he wants to of course). A team is obligated to allow that player to do so (although this doesn't count for the olympics, which is why you don't see the best teams there).However, there is definitely something to be gained for the club aswell. During these national games, a lot of people are watching, including scouts. It's very possible that your player will fetch a better price come transfer season that if you hadn't sent him away.Ultimately I think it's also a good way of making sure teams don't rely too much on foreign talent. For example, if the Netherlands has to play a national game during a week, then obviously the domestic competition doesn't play during that week (meaning you don't have to miss players).
1 You literally just proved my point, he got picked up by a team after he got dropped and won the cup, getting hurt in the Olympics did nothing to his overall career 
0 Yeah I'm not gonna read it I don't care, take it easy man
0 I mean, Crosby and Malkin lose all the time. McDavid and his 14 1st overall buddies are sitting comfortably in the basement of the league right now. I get it, Canada is still a monster and Sid/McD would be incredible but it's still a team game and I'm still delusional so...
1 They just allow you to recover much more efficiently and push yourself much harder. 
1 I agree with your sentiments. It would be very cool to see. In your post you mention yourself though that these athletes train their entire lives. Many of these kids are not given any choice when they are young; their parents and trainers push them very hard. But how early is too early to start doping? Can parents and trainers consent to their kids getting modified, and even if it is illegal, will try hard trainers really choose what is best for health?There will always be a way to “cheat” the system. The only way to have a no holds barred system is to be really cutthroat and there will be people (atheletes) taken advantage of. That’s why there needs to be limits.
1 What the fuck are you on you wanna be alt right Nazi scum
1 Hey look, I get that it's a big deal in your little country of less people than the single state of *California* but Canada's corruption seriously looks like NOTHING to us in the USA right now. I mean, are you kidding with us or something? Trying to put yourself in a corruption list with the USA, Russia, and Greece? Do you have a leader who is attempting to use twitter to curry favors and goad another country into *nuclear* war?? Would you rather live in Mexico where they had to deputize the ARMY because they can't trust the POLICE?I think some Greek people are using old currency as toilet paper.
1 :) I think it's actually a good thing that we're mostly overlooked in global politics. Let all the other kids in the schoolyard fight amongst themselves. We'll just stick to our own life of dodging furry mammals dive bombing from Eucalyptus trees. 👍
1 Our brain drain problem isn't because of rich people moving over - simply being educated enough to get a good job in the States is enough incentive for us to lose some of our most talented people.I go to the best program for Computer Science here in Canada, and most of my classmates move to the US after graduation. No "truly shit" country could say the same.
1 Uh... no? I've been to Detroit a few times and have at least a working knowledge of the city, and have spent most of my career studying Chechnya post-second war. Anyone who says the two are close in terms of quality of life is, frankly, a fucking idiot.As for average quality of life across the US or Russia, there's no universal measurement. If you looked at education, for instance, they're fairly compatible. The United States has a higher cost of living, higher poverty rate, and higher unemployment, [but it also has a much stronger economy in general, with a GDP eight times larger than Russia's](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Russia/United-States/Economy). [Russia also has far greater wealth inequality than the United States.](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/01/russia-is-the-most-unequal-major-country-in-the-world-study.html)
1 In the middle of my 4th reread.
1 Yeah, I totally agree with you!
1 > Doesn't matter what administration, Bush, Obama, Trump, Russia is significantly worse than we are.I really disagree with this. Russia kills orders of magnitude fewer foreigners in wars of conquest than the US does, at least since the USSR fell (before which it was a lot more even). Killing people is the most important metric in judging a state's behaviour in my opinion.
1 You're right, it's complicated. However, that's why I think "de facto leaking classified information is illegal" shouldn't be how the law is written. Ideally, this point would be moot, because our governments would stop breaking their own damn laws to continue the cold war, but we're not in that world yet. 
1 Anwar al-Awlaki was the target.
1 And I have to assume that someone pissed in your coffee this morning.
1 Fair enough. People aren't machines and will always have biases and personal beliefs bleed into how they interpret even objective facts.
0 ah the scary russian hackers, all smoke and no gun. "looking good" isn't at the top of putin's list right now.
1 You know what's great about the IIHF? They have full capability to enact bylaws and extract appropriate dues from its members to cover the expenses, which the member nations and/or the national Olympic committees should have covered in the first place, given that they are the ones that are directly using and benefiting from the NHL's product. It's almost like the IIHF is the exact type of organization that should be covering these costs, but no, the NHL needs money specifically from the IOC because ... reasons?  The NHL's offer is ridiculous on its face considering that Olympic participation is not a viable benefit for more than half of the union members. Trading the fate of over half the players for the benefit of the minority makes no sense; the NHL knew it, the NHLPA confirmed it. Essentially equating "$10-20 million" to be the same as 3 years of uninterrupted $2+ billion revenue makes it even more of a joke. The fact that the CBA became a negotiating point out of the blue in mid November, after the IIHF offer, screams NHL greed and I-swear-we're-not-the-bad-guys smoke and mirrors. 
2 Except hurting the Ottawa Senators that season when they lost their star goalie for the entire season, probably costing them a championship, sure nothing happened.Do you think the NHL owners don't want to play in the Olympics because they're just mean?
1 No no please don't misunderstand, as a Sharks fan I know full well of being tired of all the love Crosby and Mcdavid get. I can't deny that they're both really, really good though. Of course I'd want Captain America Pavelski to take home the gold (even if that means Dustin Brown likely gets one too), I just don't think it would happen. 2010 was the closest we were gonna get in a long time.
1 Uh, yes.>You (/u/WaitingToBeBanned) were saying inner Detroit is close in quality of life to Chechnya. - /u/ArkadiiThat is a lie.
1 You are a strong person
1 You could argue that for sure. To me, if they were given more of an opportunity to do that "wars" perhaps we would see similar results. Then again, that's a moot point since they we really don't know. I don't disagree with that really.
1 Here you are just making up nonsense for who knows what reasons, why do you do that? What do you get out of it?
1 True but federal and SCOTUS judges typically have a long history of law practice where they learn to separate how they feel from the law itself. 
1 Like I said, not very bright.
1 No they don't want their players to play because they lose out on advertising money, so instead they made their own international tourney aka World Cup of Hockey. I get why it's just stupid Olympic hockey was incredible when NHL players were in it
1 That's why I said I'm still delusional. In my mind I want to see USA smack the taste out of Canada's mouth but I know damn well what would most likely happen. That being said, I wouldn't be so sure about Canada being untouchable for too much longer. USA hockey has been doing very well in the developmental department and more and more US born players are being drafted earlier every year. If you look at the top prospects for this upcoming draft, Canada has *maybe* 2 players in the top 10 rankings right now. Times are changing and the shit winds are a blowin Canada. Can you hear em? I can.
1 > Me: There is no place in America that approaches the level of hell that is Chechnya.> You: Inner Detroit is probably close
1 >  if they were given more of an opportunity to do that "wars" perhaps we would see similar resultsI think you're probably right about that.
1 That's great. But in practice that isn't how it works.
1 yeah just resort to that good job
1 No mention of quality of life. That means you not only a liar, but a poor one at that.
3595 "Guys, let's maybe not invite Pence to the next keg party."
1 His roommate: "Hey dude. I'm trying to bring this girl back tonight. Can I borrow the room for a couple hours?"Pence, with a confused look: "But you're not married."
11419 Pence is like an un-customized avatar
2270 I heard a similar story about Ted Cruz from someone who went to Harvard with him. Granted, this is information once or twice removed so keep your skeptical hats on, but the story goes that Cruz was down big in a dorm poker game. Rather than pay his debt, he ratted to the university on the guys hosting the game. They either got expelled or suspended, can't remember which.
3099 And all his frat brothers regretted ever voting him in.   Deja Vu.  
872 Yeah, but his frat bro was married to a box of wine and shouldn't have been spending private time with a beer keg anyway. 
147 The thumbnail for this post is fucking great haha.
733 Why'd they let him keep his letters after betraying his brothers?
151 Mike "Want some beer ? Not in here !" Pence 
260 Snitches....
153 Of course he did. 
68 He seems like a right tit, but this story isnt really news, tabloid crap. 
111 He's not the guy I'd hang out with, but I'm OK with a public official being the kind of guy who would report rulebreaking. 
217 Integrity isn't a bad quality for a government representative. It seems like he used it all up before making it to the office of the Vice President unfortunately. 
313 ...and yet he is actively supporting Trump and all his lies.
37 Goes on to become a tobacco lobbyist.The ability of these people to rationalize should never be underestimated.
131 "Pwinciple Twump, they're dwinking bweer!"
20 Not defending the guy, but I went to the same college as him and the campus safety team is very strict about their alcohol rules; beer and wine only, no kegs allowed. (I know people drink liquor there but security would make you pour it out even if you were over 21) I'm sure some guy in my house would have had the same attitude if he got wind of it, I know there was a big fight at my house over some guy making jungle juice for a party, they thought it was a big risk. Also 100% sure that some of the frats/people at the party would rat out a party for petty stuff like this. (Sig) 
26 Mike "You like it in the crapper, you get the zapper" Pence
61 It gets so much worse..."An evangelical Christian, he once attended a music festival billed as the Christian Woodstock and spent days “rocking out to Jesus-loving prog-rock bands and born-again Bob Dylan imitators.”
57 Just to be clear, we are upset that the VP was honest when questioned by authorities about wrong-doing instead of lying to cover up for his friends?
34 >Pence, who believes that women and men should never dine aloneActually he only said that he doesn't like to dine alone with any woman but his wife. But to expect accuracy & honesty from Newsweek is laughable.
79 Going against the grain here.I don't think Pence is a snitch. I think it's proof he has a Holier than thou attitude and he sticks his nose in harmless or inane business where it doesn't belong.He probably ratted out a guy with a blunt and then claimed how much of a "good guy" he was for reporting criminal activity. Pence is the quintessential old biddy who peeks into windows of her neighbors. 
5 Seems like it.
4 This does not surprise me at all.
1 This fucking guy 
11 I always knew he was a Blue Falcon. 
11 Vice President Buzz Killington
39 And this is bad because?Maybe it's because I'm not part of a frat and I don't drink but this seems inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
17 I'm surprised he was in a frat. Figured him to be leading the Campus Crusade for Christ nerds.
3 I feel like in all fairness if he had aspirations of running for office and the school had a strict rule against kegs he was probably covering his own ass in case they got busted. He's still a slimeball though.
2 Pence learned very young how to sell out your friends to take a step up the ladder. Now he's training under the best. A man who sold out his entire country. 
1 And he had snuck in a keg in his frat people would be savaging him for breaking rules, breaking the law, showing the sort of scofflaw character that makes him untrustworthy as a politician and so on. Get a life people. 
1 Honestly he kind of sounds over controlling
1 That honestly might be the worst thing I've ever read about anyone in office. These are the loyal people running Washington
1 A regular buzz killington
5 At least him being a straitlaced prick isn't an act. I find some solace in that, I guess.
1 He's like the anti-Joe Biden meme.
12 At least he supports the rule of law, so that is a plus.
67 Not a Pence fan, but I don't hold this against him.  What is really fucked up is the frats these days getting little freshmen killed with their irresponsible binge drinking behavior.  Pence should be made an honorary member of all these frats.
10 Why is there so much anti-Trump stuff on reddit today? 
10 Welcome to the filter list, /r/nottheonion.  There's absolutely zero irony or weirdness involved in this title.  This sub is just another /r/politics clone now.  You lasted long, my old friend.
1 > allegedly snitchedAnd it was according to one person, yea that's called hearsay and /r/politics tripping over petty nothingness.
4 I always kind of expected he was "that guy" but didn't realize he was "THAT guy". What a square. 
2 Let's see him rat out his co-workers this time around, then.
1 What a fucking nerd lmao 
1 Ratting out your fraternity brothers. NF
1 Bro....not cool 
1 There are lots of reasons to hate Pence that actually have a bearing on the current day. I feel like stuff like this dilutes those. 
1 Surely that’s exactly the kind of characteristic you’d want in a politician? Standing up for what’s right, in the face of peer pressure?
1 This party animal needs to stop 
1 As much as I dislike Mike Pence, how is this news? 
1 Man incharge of the country sticks to the rules.
1 We have a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
1 Mike Pence? Mike "electric chair the gay away" Pence?
1 If this were "pence got in trouble for drinking underage" the shoe would be on the other foot.  This sub in a nutshell. 
1 Well at least we know he follows the rules
1 This is news??
1 Joins fraternity.Understands established procedures for keg party.Is put in charge of "deflection".Rats out and even guides campus staff to the terrible no-good 5% beer.One wonders why a person would join a fraternity, knowing that they're social organizations that hold mixers and parties, and still act like a shit-heel.Of course, it's all par for the course for this administration. The highest ranking people in the nation always seem surprised when one of their own is doing something incredibly illegal, and instantly bail on said person, throwing them on their own sword. Whatever happened to "the buck stops here" where the people in charge are held responsible for their lackeys' actions?
1 I'm from Indiana, and I am terrified of him becoming president.  He is the worst vice President to be puked up by this state, and that's saying a lot.I have a bad back, and I'd barely heard of kratom before this dickweasel made it illegal in this state.
1 Who are these utterly unlikable douchebags running this country?  This aren't people I'd want to spend *any* time with, let alone want them leading or making important decisions.They don't seem admirable.  Quite the contrary.
1 If the libs have to dig this deep to find dirt, and this is what they find, they've got bigger things to worry about than a keg.
1 The guy that all those frat bros voted for turns out to be the least frat of all. 
1 This is it get rid of the whole cabinet Rule #1 Saturday’s are for the boys
1 Holy shit, I think reddit is scraping the bottom of the barrel of stupid.Do people actually give a shit about this? Why tf is this on the front page?
1 Considering they likely weren't allowed to party, he just did the right thing. Why would you be mad that our VP is completely transparent no matter who broke the rules?Seems like a great quality to have running the country.Reddit is far left however so no one will understand this.
1 Can we find something actually bad about him to try and denounce him? Not to say he's a saint. but this is bordering on propaganda. 
1 TIFU by ratting out my frat brothers for having a keg.  Obligatory ‘ok this was not today but several decades ago.’  So the movie Animal House had just come out, and...
1 What an asshole.
1 Attention everyone! The punch has been spiked! Your parents have been notified and are on the way! 
1 I feel like if this detail was made known, he never would have been elected to office in a state like Indiana. 
1 So this piece of shit is both a frat boy and a tool.
1 So Mike Pence’s daughter was dating a member of my Fraternity last year and it was great because Secret Service would be down the road from any party which prevented cops from being too rough on those involved. 
1 American Christianity: where you literally believe in a god and savior who drinks and shares alcohol with his friends, who gives to the poor and helps the sick, but where you believe it's wrong to drink and give to the poor and help the sick^*.^^^^*Actual ^^^^beliefs ^^^^may ^^^^vary
1 Sounds like the guy you give a bid to because his dad was a founder.
1 For all the criticisms of his values, you know who hasn’t been accused of sexual harassment...
1 WE'RE ALL GOIN' STREAKIN' ON THE QUA-...........oh hi Mike
1 Oh no he got further in life than his frat bros and now they are nitpicking bullshit. Gimme a break. They were interested in booze. He was interested in furthering himself.
1 So a mature person, who respects his wife.... and people shame that. No wonder our country fucking sucks and constantly votes for scumbags. 
1 Wait, we are criticizing him for reporting illegal activities? How exactly is that something worthy of mockery?
1 What a square
1 Fucking snitch
1 Why does anyone care about this? 
1 I find it hilarious liberals tease Pence for this and in the same breath criticize Billy Bush for not speaking up against Trump.  You either want a boy scout or you don't.  I think the real issue might be you don't know what it is you actually want.
1 I feel confident in saying that this is the single most Mike Pence thing I have ever heard.
1 Must suck to have an honest guy in office huh.... 
8 Oh look, more fake news that reddit will upvote straight to the top.  After being lied to by the very fake media thousands of times you'd think you people would finally learn.
4 thats a paddlin...
2 What happened to this man? Who hurt him?
1 This is kind if a pathetic attempt to smear vp Pence. 
1 Mike Pence only goes to dinner or events that involve alcohol if his wife comes as well. Wow! What a scumbag. He must hate women!Mike Pence didn't fall on the sword for his fraternity brothers over a kegger. Wow! He must be a loser. Fraternity > Future. This article is drivel. He's an odd guy, but holy shit, it's hilarious how hard people are trying to paint him as some sort of scumbag. 
4 Why is this a bad thing?
4 SO what?
3 He does look like that kind of a bitch
1 This headline doesn’t hurt Mike Pence. I actually like hearing about politicians that are authentic to what they believe.
1 Why is this news? 
0 This man has no honor.
2 >Pence “was not a particularly hard partier” but oversaw his brothers’ complicated plans to sneak alcohol into the house and was in charge of ironing out any issues with adults if things went wrong.In college, YOU'RE A FUCKING ADULT!!
2 On one hand, he betrayed the code of honor amongst his brothers. On the other hand, he dignified the code of honor of following the law. On one hand, he told his peers that he would guard for them and then went back on his word. on the other hand..... cant think of anything.What the fuck, Pence?
1 Well that's what happens when you join Kappa Kappa Kappa 
1 How awesome is it for Mike Pence that the "dirt" on him is that he followed the rules too rigidly in college and that out of respect for his wife he won't dine alone with other women. 
1 Guess Reddit can't find any dirt on this guy.
1 We back on this petty shit? 
1 Seems like a reflection of his integrity, dunno why this is being run as a smear piece.
1 Hey! A Vice President who respects the authority and the rules! How horrible.
-6 It makes sense. Crook for president and snitch for vice.
-18 Wow so it’s like once a piece of shit always a piece of shit... weird 
1 Nobody told him about our nationwide no-snitching policy?
1 Trump's ready for him with the Polonium no doubt.
0 This is the exact kind of thing you would write on a sign at a sporting event to be funny. "Hunter Pence ratted his frat out for having a keg."
0 Then what? Don't snitches get stitches?
1 My tin foil hat tells me this piece of background information was pushed out to make it seem less likely Pence would have been party to any wrongdoings of the Trump administration.But just because you've got a problem with underage drinking doesn't mean you're not going to join in on some treasonous collusion to win a presidential election. 
1 I bet Mike Pence is fun at parties.
1 brutal. I hope he got his ass beat for that.
1 Dude, you can be against renewable energy sources... you can deny the science of global warming...But if I want to crush a keg of Rolling Rock with my 9 stupid college friends, you better keep your damn mouth shut. 
1 Impeach Trump now!!!  
1 I can't wait for Pence's Twitter account to like a keg stand during spring break video.
1 Please remember folks; this man believes this is END TIMES and wants to have funerals for fetuses.
1 I bet he was the guy that would remind teachers to give everyone homework
1 No wonder no one likes him!
0 Pence is a snitch!
0 Fucking narc. 
0 He would.
0 This is what we should expect from the younger version of the man that calls his wife Mother.
1 A keg is too much. A couple of kids getting a little drunk is too much. Selling out your country, screwing up a nation, lying to America though....
0 Lambda Lambda Lambda?
0 Talk about a dude that is out of touch with regular Americans....unless of course he called the cops as a distraction, stole the keg, took it to the sorority next door, charged $5 a cup. That is the American way!! 
1 That was the point everyone should have figured out he was a spineless douche 
1 Well that's not a surprise 
1 So this guy willingly ratted out his frat for some beer, but will also willing puts up with Trumps shit? Good ol doublethink.
1 so, did he get STITCHES or what?!?
0 Typical FIJI move.
0 He's one of those...
0 Oh my, the trolls are out en mass today
0 It was an interstellar galactic kegger.
0 I hope they made his life hell. 
0 Ewww what a fecking *deck*.
0 I'd rather have party-pig-fucker David Cameron do what he did than this, *WHAT A SQUARE*
0 Haha what a bitch 
0 Did he have to ask is "Mother" first for permission to rat out?
0 This is the most Mike Pence thing I’ve ever read
1 most if not all fraternity's insurance policies state that they're not allowed to have alcohol on the premises, so take that as you will.
0 Snitch
0 He rats out his "brothers" and gets a guaranteed job after graduation. Today, if he has a "moment of moral clarity" and rats out his "new brothers" he will become President. Watch out Trump, Little P is wearing a wire ! 😁
0 Of course he fucking did.
0 He seems the type 
0 Pence is a straightedge extremist 
0 This fucking scumbag 
0 There should be a subreddit called "least surprising things I have ever heard". 
0 People like Pence. What do they do for fun?  Like, what’s their idea of chilling out?
1 Mike "I got the Itch to Snitch" Pence
1 Lock this motherfucker up
1 This is exactly the type of person Trumpettes wouldn't want to follow, they would call him a loser and worse. But the hive mind will fall into line when the time comes. They never adhere to what thet believe when the propaganda tells them differently.
1 That’s so pence LOL
1 This is too perfect 
1 Fucking Nancy boy
1 Somehow this affects my opinion of him more than anything else. 
1 Mother did not approve
1 Literally the most unrepublican thing I've ever heard of tbh 
1 Damn they’re finished now!!
1 Damn. We should be ashamed to have a VP straight from Squaresville.
1 He always looked like a snitch. 
1 Of course he did.
1 That's one serious Bro-fence. 
1 DRTA, but I have a similar story.  We were a week away from having our colony chartered and some high ranking members were coming by to visit.  Nothing official just a social keep up the good work type of visit.Our one brother decided that was a good day to bring a keg to our unofficial house 7 of us were living in.  Now our rules are simple - you can have 30 packs to the ceiling no problem - No Kegs.  At least that's the way our chapter advisor told it to us.I tell him he probably wants to take that somewhere else, fed not good timing etc.  Doesn't listen.  I walk upstairs knock on the chapters President and tell him whats going on.  He tells me "That boy needs a coming to Jesus talk"We got the keg out of the house about 20 minutes before the execs arrived so happy ending yes but narrowly destroyed our chance of ever becoming a chapter.
1 Mother knows best.
1 Party Pooper Pence
1 I'm looking forward to the day Mueller nails his ass to the wall and Mikey snitches out Trump.
1 He’s a bitch 
1 The worst part is that he's a snitch. 
1 How do I retweet this
1 He's six months older than me yet looks twenty years older.
1 I'm not sure I understand. Are people not allowed to have kegs in the USA?
1 It does not surprise me that he was in a frat though. In general, the worst people on your campus are going to be found in fraternatiys or sororities. 
1 Won't rat out the president for treason. Why?
1 I already hated him, but now I hate him even more ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
1 what a fucking surprise
1 If the Boondocks taught me anything it taught me about Snitching: A Retrospective. 
1 Yeah he just likes drinking Koch. 
1 Pence sounds like the polar opposite of Joe Biden.
1 "At the time of the incident, the fraternity was reportedly having wild parties re-creating its favorite scenes from Animal House, which had recently been released. Pence “was not a particularly hard partier”  "I imagine many others would do the same in his place, regardless if they're not a homophobe and/or a conservative.
1 White House is full of corrupt, immoral, killjoy, fuckheads.
1 Fucking narc.
1 And Trump eats steak with ketchup. Un-american. 
1 Go watch the monologue at the end of Scent of a Woman...Pence is what you would call a Bard man.
1 No bid 
1 People make fun of him but what are the odds of him ever being involved in a sex scandal like Weinstein or Lauer given his "never be alone with women" policy? Should make people think. 
1 Goddamn. Talk about a squeaky clean record. 
1 What a tool.
1 Haha we'll finally get blumpf out of office! For realsies this time!! In peach!
1 What a fuckin twat. 
1 What a douche canoe
1 What a pansy 
1 > At the time of the incident, the fraternity was reportedly having wild parties re-creating its favorite scenes from Animal House, which had recently been released. His favorite character was obviously Neidermeyer.
1 Dickhead is as dickhead does.
1 What a dork.
1 Sooo Pence is keen on following the rules, even if it's his friends that break them?
1 A born cunt.
1 I’m certain nobody will be surprised by this. 
1 He's tighter than a ducks butt and that's waterproof!
1 I bet he stood there with his arms crossed and said "This is for your own good.  You'll thank me later."
1 Peak mike pence
1 God's work! 
1 What a fucking geed
1 Oh no our vice president was following the rules of his school, fraternity, and the law in college. HOW DARE HE.
1 You gotta do what you gotta do to protect the chapter long-term.  
1 What a dick.
1 Seems like some bitch shit he would do
1 [Mike Pence parrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_oVUgvm-M)
1 Clearly he's not to blame. It's the dopes that let him join to begin with that are the issue. 
1 Mike Pence seems exactly like the kind of guy who would do that, so that's not the least bit surprising. I once lived with about 20 other student one semester when were interning in DC. One of them was a guy just like Mike Pence, a conservative Christian who didn't drink. In the middle of the semester, we learned that he had been snitching on us for having parties at our house.  Thankfully, our school's administration didn't seem to give a shit, and none of us got in trouble.
1 That's a Ted Cruz move
1 "Snitches get stitches."
1 It's a weird rule to expect the sober door warden to eat the charge.  Typically that honor goes to whoever caused campus security to visit (ex: the guy who decided it would be an awesome idea to stand naked in the front yard and scream-sing Bon Jovi or whatever).  The more sober folks are expected to help mitigate damages/dispose of evidence while the drunk guy refuses to put his pants back on, but I've never heard of them being expected to claim ownership of the kegs.
1 no, can't be
1 Conservatives are NEVER the life of the party anyways.  They are very boring. 
1 Not frat
1 What a tool
1 The worst kind of human
1 i have yet to meet the repressed conservative without a closet full of smut...

1 He was just mad it wasn't a keg of milk 
1 of all the things he has done, this pisses me off the most. fucking loser.
1 nuff said. 
1 The thumbnail chosen for this article makes the headline even better.
1 What's with the article stating that Pence believes men and women shouldn't dine alone? Pence was only talking about himself.
1 We'd have dropped him, and then some probably
1 I guarantee Pence is hiding some dark secret.
1 Being a B student isn’t terrible. 
1 If it was a keg of lady speed stick he'd be all in
1 Will he rat out Trump, though?
1 It was skanky beer!
1 Is this shit on Pence day? I don’t hate it lol. I feel like trump is leaking about of Pence stuff because this morning he found out Pence was willing to replace him in GOP ticket and Pence’s wife thinks trump is vile 
1 And the kicker...it was root beer.
1 What a fucking penis. 
1 I have to respect that sort of integrity. But that's where it ends.
1 Pretty straight laced.  In a party scene I would have hated him, as the VP I think this is good news.
1 I don’t even get this, I thought all fraternities drank and were ok with it, why would you join one if you’re not. And if there are fraternities where they don’t drink I’d assume that’s a thing for them, there wouldn’t be a fraternity that had just one party a year, right? 
1 I hate that this doesn't surprise me.
1 https://i.imgur.com/vbMfF.gif
1 Is that REALLY a surprise though?
1 God he’s had a stick up his ass his whole life 
1 Not frat
1 Narc!
1 That explains thy it looks like he is held together by stitches
1 He's like George Washington. He cannot tell a lie. Except about Russia. 
1 What a bitch
1 Fuckin square
1 So does that make him trust worthy, or an ass?
1 I can confirm he is not a bro. bitch move made my a bitch boy
1 Hmm...a guy who acts with integrity and stands up for what was right in that situation?WHAT A NERD.I mean, I'm the farthest thing from a Pence supporter, but it's funny how reddit loves the whistle blowers until it's someone like Pence.
1 Wow, they're really reaching if they have to go back 40 years to find something to nail him for.
1 good. degeneracy needs to be outed. 
1 Mike Pence literally sucks 
1 Like I needed another reason to hate pence, but this might take the cake 
1 What a fucking douche 
1 They call him 'honest mike'
1 Dickish though it is, that's not the worst thing you can do in a fraternity, believe me
1 What a little puss ass bitch 
1 Wow, what a douche. 
1 Is this meant to be painted as a bad thing?? He told on people for doing something wrong... Bloody good! I hate this anti-tattling culture we live in. There are certain circumstances where you don't tell, but I think it is stupid people are victimised for telling on somebody for breaking a rule.
1 Damn life is crazy. I firmly believe that ALL snitches, especially the ones like Pence should get stitches, however, I want the guy that snitches on this administration to get a medal.
1 is this supposed to be a bad thing? I hate the Trump administration, and dread the idea of President Pence for his ultra conservative views and forced religious endowment to our country's laws. But, jeez guys, do we really have to sensationalize everything? If anything, this would be a good quality to have for a President - dude would rat out his best friends if they were doing something wrong. Speaks eons ahead of the orange ape greasing up the oval office chair right now.
1 damn.../r/nottheonion got me again...
1 This must be Vadim's daddy
1 Just adds to his legendary status
1 Like this is a surprise. 
1 Pence reminds me of the President in Escape from LA... Maybe John Carpenter predicted the future.
1 Not frat
1 I knew I didn’t like this guy. 
1 I hope he was kicked out of the Fraternity. 
1 Snitches get stiches
1 Oh so now we're all for out of control drinking and the fraternity mindset? I can put down my pitchfork over the multiple fraternity binge-drinking related deaths this year? Yeah, Mike Pence sure is a monster for standing to some semblance of personal ethics/s
1 So you think his man would team up with someone who colluded with a foreign gov?
1 CNN: Sooo what your saying... is there's a hystory of harassment
1 Woah... so not a bro... pence can’t hang man
1 just another bullet point indicating that this entire administration is full of rotten people
1 Bruh...

1 Nf 
1 Wow totally new outlook on the guy. 
1 Jesus how many adds can one mobile site have...
1 Well we’re waiting for when he rats our Donald Trump, but oh wait he’s probably with Trump for this fucked up ploy to involve the Russians in the election. 
1 Dick move... but if that's all you can get on the man besides he doesn't eat alone with other women, than I say he's done a pretty good job
1 And I'm sure he brags about it still
1 My uncle was actually Mike Pence's frat brother in college.  He didn't know him too well, and never mentioned this story to me, but he says that Pence wasn't too bad of a guy, bit of a loner, maybe even a bit of a lady's man.  According to my uncle, none of the frat brothers were really that fond of him, but this was in Hanover College, so safe to say he was not nearly the right-wing nut he is today.  Anyway my uncle and a bunch of his frat brothers take turns sending letters to Pence every day asking him to remember who he was back then and stop being, well, who he is today.&nbsp;This is all to say that even though Mike Pence was the kind of person to rat his own fraternity brothers out for a keg, they all agree that they'd rather have *that guy* as VP of the USA than whoever the guy we have right now is.
1 I'm ashamed to be in the same fraternity as this dude. 
1 Penn State needs more guys like him.
1 What a little bitch.
1 This guy is so gay. 
1 That’s what I would expect from that guy. 
1 What a pussy
1 What a Bastard! 
1 This explains everything. Pence got many atomic wedgies for being a tattletale in school, so he grew up repressed and looking to take it out on all of us by becoming VP to the worst president in history. 
1 Why didn’t he run for president?
1 Party Foul, everybody drink.
1 Not my Vice President lol
1 What a square.
1 "Guys I joined this frat to get cucumbers up the ass when I pledged, not to drink."
1 What a PUSSAY
1 This is it! The evidence we need to put the whole White House away. WE DID IT REDDIT- WE GOT PLARNUALFD LAUMPERFEUARD AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TOO!
1 God, what a fucking weenie. I'm not surprised that he's always been a pissant little shit.
1 LOL The "news" in 2017 everybody. It's like they sharpened their razor sharp wit on the Kardashian desk before the big league
1 This is it guys! Drumpf is finished now!!
1 Bring out the pitchforks! Lock Him Up!! 
1 Good guy pence 
1 So now you hate people for playing by the rules as well as for not playing by the rules? Make up you minds already, you fucks! 
1 He's a dick. 
1 Even as a Republican college student, this hurts. 
1 Now I don't like the guy.
1 Honesty is so overrated. What a scumbag!
1 Hey at least the GOP will love whistleblowers again right? right? 
1 So he'll snitch about a keg but he'll work for a rapist and welcome a pedophile. The GOP y'all!
1 What an asshole? Stopping people from breaking the rules/laws is absolutely dispicable.
1 Pence is the type of guy to tell on his friend for showing him a dirty magazine.
1 Why is it that Republican are either the biggest squares known to earth or sociopath psychos. Or sometimes both. 
1 Youre making fun of him for telling the truth? Sure if he was just some person you can laugh about it but when establishing credibility as a Vice President youre doing nothing but helping him.
1 Here's the list of everyone who is shocked by this:1.)Thank you for taking the time to read this exhaustive list
1 Republicans are narcs, water is wet
1 Pence is not ferda 
1 I feel like no matter what horrible, racist, discriminatory, greedy, money-grubbing policies he'll support during this administration, THIS is what will always define him as a grade-a SOB.
1 Why didn’t hazing kill him?! 
1 They Took the Bar!!!! The Whole Fucking Bar!!!
1 So? You're seriously trying to portray following the rules as a bad thing?
1 Must be a sig chi
1 So he has honor and integrity. Good to know.
1 What a fucking nerd
1 And
1 Back in my day, a brother doing anything close to that would be driven to the middle of a state forest and left with his tennis shoes, his whitie tighties, and one dime to use IF he found the one pay phone several miles away.What a little bitch!
1 What a twat
1 oh lordy
1 I have never met anyone from my undergrad college in my professional life. Its a small school and once you move out of Indiana its the same as if you told someone you studied at Timbuktu.  Imagine my horror when I found out that nameless ignominy would be replaced by this disaster. My poor alma mater
1 Things Pence is morally uncomfortable with:- Illegal drinking activities in college, while being part of a fraternity- Being in the company of women who are not his wifeThings Pence is morally comfortable with:- Serving as VP to a President who openly brags about sexually assaulting multiple women- Backing a Republican politician who has been accused of raping multiple children while he was an adult working in leadership roles.Maybe Pence is not such a good assessor of morality.
1 Great. A politician with standards. Just what we need.
1 at least we can be sure he won't do anything illegal.
1 That’s what you get for inviting the Pence 
1 There's a special place in Hell for fuckers like that.
1 All the shit going on with politicians and celebrities and the best they have on Mike Pence is this.
1 Hey reddit, you're doing that "not reading the article and assuming the worst" thing again.The article says that Pence was the one who would have to answer to any authorities if the fraternity got it trouble. He went to a dry Presbyterian college so...they would have if they were caught.Sounds like he was being the responsible adult in this situation.
1 How do you even gain membership to a frat if you don't drink?
1 Fucking rat
1 What a square.
-8 What a loser
-10 What a fucking loser.
-7 Shocked! I'm shocked! (not really, he oozes "snitch" - except when it comes to Trump)
0 What a dork. 
1 And Hillary Clinton hired private investigators to destroy the lives of the women that came forward and accused her husband of sexual harassment and rape. But she's seen as a hero and the stalwart protector of feminism.
1 Mother doesn't like parties 
-2 The man is a true Snitchian.
1 Reddit is really running on fumes when it comes to twking down the Trump administration.
1 i dont drink and i see nothing wrong with snitching since snitching can save lives and its better to report issues rather than keep your mouth shut. people should not break rules just because they think they can get away with it.HOWEVER, i find snitching for drinking under 21 to be pointless. its an arbitrary number, people can drink at 18 in Europe. if there was a global specific number backed by science. it would be a different story.
1 When you don't have any meaningful or relevant things to criticize the Trump administration on, you write articles like this."Journalism" these days...
0 This should disqualify him from public office. 
1 Sometimes I feel like Pence's political career is more improbable than Trump's.
1 I’m not at all surprised by this.
1 Whadda herb
1 Seems kind of petty thing to do and a petty thing to put on news. 
1 Was he in FarmHouse?
1 What a punk birch thing to do.
1 Why am I not surprised
1 Some brother, blue falcon is more like it.
1 Hope he rats out Donny next.
1 Mike pence is a huge nerd
0 Do Anthony Wiener next! 
1 Good.
1 Ah, I see Mike Pence is a brother of Kappa Kappa Kappa 
1 Hey, he's not out there raping kids, bragging about sexual assault in general, or spitroasting his daughter with his son-in-law.That puts him a bit above average for the current crop of GOP politicians.
1 Putting all politics aside, this is a great way to illustrate how shitty of a human being Pence is. 
1 I always knew he's that guy. Not surprised. 
1 Am I supposed to be mad? Fuck degenerate college students.
0 I guess the news media is trying to get us ready for the pending Pence presidency, given Drumpf's is living on borrowed time.
1 /r/politics is leaking everywhere today. Ah newsweek, the same quality source that you'll see over at politics subreddits being touted as reliable and gold standard. 
1 I can’t believe Newsweek actually published this. I’m just disappointed really. No news is fake I guess. 
1 Holy crap the future attorney general once actually enforced the law? Damn that's messed up.The law is bad but it is the law. Blame that. Realistically doss anyone want an AG who ignores laws they dislike? I don't want a "cool" AG, I want a strict by the books enforcer of the laws.
1 How is this considered news?
1 Who fucking cares?
1 Fuck this guy and his morals.
1 Snitches get stitches 
1 Mike Pence confirmed for being a little bitch.
1 He'd rat out over a keg but not over obvious collusion with a foreign nation.
1 Meh if it was “Pence once helped sneak a keg into a frat party” Reddit would start shouting and crying that he helped condone the potential rape of women through consumption.
1 I think it’s funny people don’t like him because he has strong beliefs and is old-fashioned. 
1 What a dick. 
1 Fuckin narc 
1 Wow.. Really? what 40 years ago? Maaaaaaan, is Newsweek digging that deep to put together a "hit" piece, or what?  What happened to Newsweek?  I guess when there's nothing current - you start looking at the college days..  Oh and love the, "Pence, who believes that women and men should never dine alone, smugly looks at the camera while a woman sits on his lap."Wasn't his objection that a married man should dine with another woman without his spouse?
1 How is this onion related? The logic basically goes "if it's against conservative beliefs, IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONION." Meanwhile "black and orange spirit day" is not oniony enough
1 Good for him. 
1 Who the fuck cares 
1 At this point you are making fun of his religious beliefs. What happened to the "tolerant left"?
1 Then he will surely eat out the president *crosses fingers*
-7 Snitches get stitches, bitches.
-10 God I wish I could have been one of the people who got the privilege of ruthlessly hazing him as a pledge.
-20 Secretly gay, sober, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.
-1 Hey, HEY! I will have you idiots know that he was a legend, A LEGEND at that frat house! You stupid IDIOTS! IDIOTS!*Edit: People, it's a quote from Always Sunny... I'm not being serious.*
-7 [deleted]
-3 What a bitch.
-3 What a piece of shit.
-2 It’s better than being a serial molester like Biden
-5 Pence you sack of shit. Go fuck yourself and get fucked.
-1 Willing to bet that's the same face Pence makes each time he has to inform Mother that he got another stiffy while working out at his all-male fitness club. 
-1 Rat fink!!!
-2 How did they not beat the ever-loving crap out him? Snitches get stitches! 
-4 You can't trust a guy like that.
-1 I didn't think I could hate this guy any more, but dammit man, you DON'T BREAK BRO-CODE
-1 What a total douche
1 yet he lies for trump.  I guess whatever gets you ahead in life
1 This is the definition of lawful evil.
1 Mike pence was in a fraternity, that should tell you enough right there. 
1 I see no problem here. It was a dry campus and a fraternity house throwing the kegger.  Pence did what was right and keep in mind that we are only hearing one side of the story. Is it possible that he approached the party organizers in an attempt to try and talk them out of it?  Is it possible that Pence actually made the fraternity better in the long term?If you don’t agree with Pence’s politics, that is one thing. To attack him for following the rules, especially when we have seen lives actually lost because of frat houses abusing alcohol, is immature at best. I give him props for not kowtowing to frat guys wanting to break rules and abuse alcohol. I have zero issue with what he did and something tells me that he doesn’t regret it either. He is the damn VICE PRESIDENT of the US. Obviously he made good choices in life. 
1 Wait? Wouldn't this be a positive? Like wouldn't you want someone with integrity in the Oval? Aren't people mad because Trump is the exact opposite? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!?!?
1 Can he be removed from office for this? This is some serious shit.
1 I knew he was a fucking narc!
1 A lot of Pence news all of a sudden. I think he and the Republicans in Congress are finally planning to pull the old switch-a-roo.Expect more ~~articles~~ fluff pieces about him in the coming days, especially those about disagreements with Trump.
1 Once a narc, always a narc
1 He was a phony and a brown nose. 
1 That's a bitch move right there. Automatic DQ from life. 
1 He fucking would.
1 Man, and I really thought I couldn't hate this man anymore. 
1 A jerk move.  But then again, I'd rather have a leader who is loyal to an ideal rather than a people clique
-1 Yes I head about that! One fact they left out from this article which I thought was the most interesting bit was that one of his brothers from looking to sue for damages. Can’t remember his name, think it was Recom Pence.
-1 all politicians did some puss shit in their day.
-1 I'm starting to not like this guy.
-1 Mike Pence had to pay for his friends.Totally not surprised. 
-2 This is some serious hard hitting news.
-1 How can Newsweek be taken as a serious news source with biased, sensationalized headlines and articles like this?  *"Terry Crews ratted out a Hollywood agent for sexually abusing him."*
-1 Snitches ended up in ditches 
1 Well...were they supposed to have a keg?
-2 We need to diss Pence of this non-suds 
-2 Fucking Ray. Fink. Turn coat. Bitch ass snitch. Soft batch. Weasel. 
635 "Is there a way we can vote him out?"
1 ...or that *Mother* character. 
1 I guess he learned his lesson back then and he's not a snitch anymore, damn it.
1 Hey man, there's no WAY mother would approve of alcohol. What's a boy to do?
1 I swear. It has to take serious effort to be that much of a joyless Cunt. 
1 Nice retort; even if I did vote for him.  That’s good stuff
1 not surprised one bit
1 Or to any governmental meetings.
1 Liberals and conservatives alike can agree this is reprehensible.
1 I imagine his eye would twitch signaling a reboot any second
1 "It's much more quiet in the study. Did you bring your bible or do you need to borrow one of mine?Will King James work, or do you need the dialect translation?"
1 I know a dude who owned a house in college, near campus, rented out his extra rooms to friends.He imposed a "no girls past 11pm rule" on everyone because of his religious beliefs (in a very liberal area).Idk why anyone ever rented from him. I went to college to be an adult, not be treated like a fucking child.
1 "She's underage""Oh you have my full support then"
1 "But she's a mom."
1 He does go to a church every Sunday...
2368 This is one of the most accurate descriptions of a person I've ever read.
463 This guy has had a long life, and is a very well known public figure now. Obviously you could see more significance and character tells from his time in politics - but for me, that keg thing says it all. 
48 It's because he's from the future.
15 He always reminded me of a wax figure that came to life. But I like your description, too.
122 Trump is like hitting the random button until it comes out with disproportionate features & you name him "Babyman"
7 Preset 8
41 I like you 
5 Which also means I need a new Discord account picture.
5 Ha!
1 Pence is like if you want to play as Joe Biden in a WWE videogame but Joe's not on the roster, so you try to create him in the character creator but you couldn't get the details right. 
1 LOL WTFFFFF , mind blowing how accurate this is. 
1 He genuinely looks like Cyrus Temple, the villain from Saints Row IV. Bonus, that guy was a military hothead who wanted to play moral police.
1 You're like the AT&T of people, ~~Britta~~ Pence
1 I read that as "uncircumcised"
1 https://twitter.com/notonyourchance/status/938153854461513728
1 As much as I'd hate the guy on a personal level. Isn't he right?
1 Pence is every man that has thrown a frisbee for his dog in every Cialis commercial.
1 Definitely has the face of an oblivion npc
1 I read this as "un-circumcised" and was momentarily very in the dark about the world of avatars. 
1 He looks like a the standard white politician in movies.
1 I don't get it someone explain please 
1 http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Mingan
1 My name is Pence and I live in the village
1 OK goddamn Reddit you made me chuckle.
1 Pence always looks like he's about to introduce legislation to outlaw the X-men
1 A real basic bitch.
1 Omg I’m dying. 
0 Just as Romney is the president from Central Casting, Pence is the vice president from Central Casting.
1 Son of dork! Son of dork!
1 As a fan of the NFL, I'm saddened by the firing of Ben McAdoo, because there's no longer an outlet for McAdoo jokes. Can we make Pence jokes the new thing, please?

169 Relavent - Cruz's roommate has quite the dirt on him from college.https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/06/05/ted-cruzs-college-roommate-tormentor-recounts-awkward-princeton-reunion
439 This is why I’m not sure Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer. That rat bastard is too cowardly to actually kill someone, he’s more of a Pettigrew than a Voldemort. I can totally see him molesting an underage wizard for years.
107 Cruz's freshman roommate at Princeton [has been blasting him on Twitter for years](https://www.bustle.com/articles/155075-these-17-craig-mazin-tweets-about-ted-cruz-are-some-of-the-funniest-of-the-campaign). It's hilarious. >Ted Cruz is a nightmare of a human being. I have plenty of problems with his politics, but truthfully, his personality is so awful that 99 percent of why I hate him is just his personality. If he agreed with me on every issue, I would hate him only 1 percent less.[And a recent follow-up](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-roommate-porn-craig-mazin_us_59b7cff4e4b031cc65cc995d) after Cruz's account liked that porn video a few months ago. 
112 I don't know of a single person that likes Ted Cruz. I remember Al Franken saying in an internet "I actually like Ted Cruz more than anyone else in the Senate does... and I hate Ted Cruz."
11 Ted Cruz went to Princeton but yeah apparently he was a terrible roommate 
40 Why would they be punished for playing poker? 
4 > someone who went to Harvard with himThis is likely from the successful screenwriter [Craig Mazin](https://twitter.com/clmazin) who was Ted Cruz's roommate. 
4 He also was noted for strutting around in a paisley robe.Probs need to head over to r/Eyebleach after thinking of that image.
1 It was on Pod Save America (or Lovett or Leave It). One of the people they had on was his roommate in college. They also talked about how he would wander the halls in his bathrobe creeping on girls. 
11 The fact that Ted Cruz went to Harvard confirms it was the right decision to go to community college.
3 That sounds unlikely....
1 I mean, I would certainly consider doing this if I owed money I couldn't pay. Sure it's shitty but I can't really condemn him for it. 
1 The article by Ted Cruz’s former debate club rival was among the saddest things I’ve ever read.  
1 Sounds like a real politician alright
1 Kinda like the government shut down in 2013? 
1 Was this before or after he murdered several people and left cryptic clues?
1 Was this before or after he murdered several people and left cryptic clues?
1 Somewhat similar story from a former boss who went to Princeton with him for undergrad (Cruz went to Harvard law). Basically Cruz would always try to organize basketball games but everyone hated him so they would show up and then not let him play. 
1 How I imagine [Ted Cruz](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/recess/images/8/86/Randall.png/revision/latest?cb=20150430160454)
1 And now they’re even. Good for Señor Cruz. They should have let him win. 
1 Yuge if true 
0 What a piece of useless shit
1834 No it wasn't Deja Vu. It was Phi Sigma Gamma. 
1 _...I've just been in this place before_
96 To be fair, he only joined for the initiation rituals where they do r/totallystraight stuff
1 deja entendu?
1 I’m surprised he wasn’t hazed to death.:.
1 Are you implying that the people who voted for Pence regret it? Because that's definitely not the case.
1 He was frat president, so he was doing something right
1 They aren't the only ones.
54 I only drink slightly fermented grape juice with permission from mother. And even then I pray for days after. 
104 I would never dine alone with a beer. My box of wine needs to be there, too.
1 This is likely an unpopular opinion but, with all the sexual abuse scandals coming out, you'd think people would be praising Pence for his conduct in regards to woman whom are not his spouse. He doesn't put himself in potentially compromising situations.He stays loyal to his spouse and honors her by abiding by their agreed on conditions in regards to spending time with the opposite sex. People can call it prudish or old fashioned but if the men in Hollywood who so many idolize acted in the same way as Mike Pence in regards to opposite sex, there would be a lot less victimized women. Whether you agree with his policies or political ideology or not, one thing is certain, Mike Pence is not likely to be in a situation where he has the option to act inappropriately towards a member of the opposite sex and for that I applaud him. 
1 So ashamed.
1 https://i.redd.it/jhykjevx6gky.jpg
1 It's the universal politician shame face.https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/obama-ap-93013.jpg?w=650http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721183714-donald-trump-exlarge-169.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/je3q5.jpg
1 I like to think they took that picture when on of his kids ate a cookie before dinner. 
1 It's probably a picture of him after one of his attempts to take assistance away from poor people were thwarted .
647 I imagine tossing him would look bad. The organization can't officially endorse underage consumption or possession, and they can't openly punish people who enforce their official policies against such actions. Doesn't mean they treated him kindly afterwards.
74 Kicking someone out is a massive pain in the ass even when they do something wrong, so pushing for that would've been borderline impossible, they'd have been better off pissing him off until he deactivated rather than kick him out formally
1 Because you can't boot someone for following the rules?
4 Because the people at Internation Headquarters who decide if he keeps his letters or not would regard this as a "good move"
1 I used to work for a fraternity at the national level. The rules have always stated “no underage consumption” and after a few lawsuits, kegs were banned as well. Guys who report it to nationals aren’t well liked after the fact, but they followed the rules so they don’t get as big of a punishment. The other thing is not getting caught in the first place. Pence let them get caught, but there are TONS of other reasons people get caught (social media is an issue with that). 
1 its just a prank bro
1 Money, I'd imagine.
1 Betraying his brothers by making them follow the **law**?
1 It's a bitch to kick someone out of FIJI once they're initiated. Easier to just socially ostracize them until they stop coming around. 
1 Kicking someone out once they are initiated is a long and annoying process. They probably just decided they didn't want to go through the trouble. 
0 His house is the elitist douchebags frat guys, they probably didn't want him to let their secrets out. Lots of fucked up stuff at their house while I was there, naked girls from the school in recruitment videos, lots of hazing, partying while on probation, etc. They were the golden boys so couldn't get kicked off campus, mostly put on 1 to 1 or probation. 
-5 Because it didn't happen 
0 Whys he still in the White house after betraying his country? People are dumb sometimes.

353 Get... elected Vice President. 
1 Get rewards, in a civilized society.
1 ... get constitchuents
-2 /r/BlackPeopleTwitter is that way
1 Not even surprised.
1 That's most news nowadays
1 I mean it is r/nottheonion
1 proper lad?
1 Right? Sure nobody wants that type of guy in their frat, but if people endorse that sort of "snitches get stitches" thing in the government, you're just *asking* for corruption..
1 too bad he doesn't anymore
1 Integrity? Getting your bros fined for underage drinking isn't going to make the world a better place... That being said, if Trump and Pence died tomorrow the world would be a better place
68 I agree. Idk why people find it weird that he won't dine alone with another woman. If it has helped him remain faithful to his wife, more power to him. 
13 But not even.  He's been quite predictable and straightforward, save for the damage control he has to do for Trump.  Pence was Governor of Indiana for 12 years...he's not a bad politician and if he was spineless he wouldn't have been elected so many times...he just isn't what the core demographic of Reddit *likes*...that has nothing to do with integrity.
1 The article doesn't make it sound like he snitched for integrity's sake. It sounds like he just wanted to brown nose the administration. 
1 or maybe he hasn't and you just think that because of your bias.
0 If he joined the fraternity as undercover vice specifically to rat them out, he is in fact the hero we need.
-3 >This was a major departure from the fraternity’s usual practice: Whoever answered the door took the blame for the booze so the whole house wasn’t formally disciplined, according to Murphy. But after Pence allegedly snitched, the entire fraternity was handed a harsh punishment.Is "integrity" when you fuck over all your friends to keep yourself out of trouble, only after being caught, no less? I forget what that word means.
1 Reading the actual description of the situation in the article, it makes perfect sense. He wasn't holier than thou -- he just wasn't willing to be punished.> Pence “was not a particularly hard partier” but oversaw his brothers’ complicated plans to sneak alcohol into the house and was in charge of ironing out any issues with adults if things went wrong.During one rowdy bash, the brothers found out a dean was coming to the house and tried to hide evidence of their illicit activities, according to the article.>The future vice president greeted the dean at the door and proceeded to direct him straight to the kegs, telling the official they belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, his former brother said.>**This was a major departure from the fraternity’s usual practice: Whoever answered the door took the blame for the booze so the whole house wasn’t formally disciplined, according to Murphy. But after Pence allegedly snitched, the entire fraternity was handed a harsh punishment.**So he was happy to party and participate, and oversaw plans that involved partying with alcohol. And when his fraternity brothers answered the door, they took it on the chin and accepted blame for the alcohol personally.But when it was Pence that got caught answering the door, he **didn't** take personal blame, and instead **took down the whole fraternity**.So, yes, he supports Trump's lies. Expect him to sit on the side and support Trump while the FBI comes for everyone else, and they take it on the chin. And when they come for Pence, expect Pence to send the whole crew down shit's creek to try to save himself.
167 This is the only relevant point here.  Reporting dangerous and illegal activity to the college is actually a good thing but it is hypocritical to them stand by someone who is a pathological liar.
1 Well Trump doesn't drink, so I guess Pence is cool with him. 
1 “Trump and all his lies” like what lies? Lol of course some dingus on reddit has to turn this into a Trump bash. Supporting someone that’s trying to better the country is completely different to ratting frat brothers out for drinking.. 
4 He's lying for Jesus 
3 Once a traitor, always a traitor.
1 He'll turn on Trump too, especially if it means he gets to be the president.
1 I've found that there are two things on this earth that will make an evangelical right winger drop their charade of moral superiority:  money and power.
1 $$$ is more important than morality in politics.
1 Pence thinks [smoking doesn't kill you](http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-pence-smoking-doesnt-kill-2017-1), Trump is thinks that regular exercise [will kill you](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/donald-trump-exercise/index.html), and is anti-vaccines. 
38 *beew
5 Mike "Men who suck cock get a shock" Pence 
68 I bet he drank whole milk that night!
49 Ironically enough a Christian woodstock sounds like the very definition of hell.
17 A Trump supporter recently tried to insult me by saying I liked the Beach Boys.  It confused me more than anything.
26 And why is that bad?
1 Jesus... I can forgive the whole 'being a rat' shit, but this is a whole other level.
1 why pop molly when you can drink chocolate milk and praise the lord 
1 Can always count on the Atheists for quality cringe
1 Yes
1 Seems to me the issue here is not that he told the authorities, but that he waited to report it to the authorities until it was a time when he would have to take the fall for it if he didn't.In other words, he didn't hear about it happening and ran off to tell the authorities. He was set to take the fall, since he was the one who happened to be present (as would be any of the rest of them if they happened to be present) and instead of going along with the system he'd actively been a part of overseeing, he reported it. Not exactly horrific all on its own, but given the man he's currently vice president to, it helps paint a picture of his true character. That when the chips are down, he is going to be self-serving over anything else. Birds of a feather, I guess.
1 Some of the people on here are so brainwashed with partisan politics it’s insane.
1 Be quiet, you! You are going against the reddit circlejerk narrative!How dare you not demonize everything this man does?!
1 Pence snitched and got a bunch of frat-boy chads in trouble?Amazing, these neckbeards love chad now!
1 You soud as lame as Mike "the keg is over here sir" Pence
1 No, we're not upset at him, we're making fun of him for being a bitch.Now, you can draw parallels to him ratting out his friends to save his own bacon once it was clear he was going to take the fall for something HE DID, which wouldn't be the best thing to do if you are a true leader of a nation. Most people, however, are just here making fun of him for being a bitch, though.
1 the dude weed lmaos have arrived
1 Because now he’s not only a terrible, terrible Vice President as well as person... we now know he’s a huge bitch too 
1 Yes, that's exactly it. We leftists are just so terrible and partisan that we think it's lame to rat out your friends for underage drinking. Shame on us. Lmao.
1 It's just desperate character attacks everywhere you look. I thought that was awesome that Pence does not dine with any woman but his wife. If they're going to turn that into a discrediting factor, then theres legitimately no hope.
1 Eventually reddit will realize that newsweek is buzzfeed level trash. 
79 >I don't think Pence is a snitch.>He probably ratted out a guyHmmmmm
2 And that kind of personality fits America's ideals, at least in foreign affairs, quite nicely.
1 Way to show you didn't even read the article
-1 Whatever helps Mike Dense is what Mike Dense will do.> Social conservatives had been lobbying the president to issue a sweeping executive order aimed at carving out protections for religious organizations and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and transgender rights. The proposed order was fairly radical, but proponents argued that it would strike a crucial blow against the militant secularists trying to drive the faithful out of the public square. At first, Pence’s office reportedly worked to build support for the executive order inside the White House—but the effort was torpedoed when a draft was leaked to The Nation magazine, which warned that signing it would “legalize discrimination.” There proceeded a noisy backlash from the left, and hasty backpedaling by the White House. By the time Trump got around to signing the order, several months later, it was dramatically watered down.>Conservatives blamed Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for gutting the order. But according to one Trump associate with knowledge of the debate, **Pence barely put up a fight**. The surrender infuriated Steve Bannon, who was then serving as the chief White House strategist. “Bannon wanted to fight for it,” says the Trump associate, “and he was really unimpressed that Pence wouldn’t do anything.” But perhaps Pence was playing the long game—weighing the risks of taking on Trump’s kids, and deciding to stand down in the interest of preserving his relationship with the president. Pence, after all, had his future to think about.
0 I'd rather have that as a president any day than the current president. Or any of the other candidates last race, to be honest.
1 What I don't understand is why he would even join a frat in the first place.
1 Buddy is only half the word!
1 Because he oversaw the alcohol being brought in and once the dean came he ratted out his friends? 
5 I know there's a stigma against Greek life right now, but you definitely don't rat out your brothers for drinking.
1 This isn’t bad. It turned out The muller investigation didn’t request access to Trump’s accounts as was all over the front page earlier today so this is the replacement story!
1 Because pretty much every college student drinks?
1 Because why would he snitch on his frat brothers, arguably his best friends in college, for underage drinking but not Drumpf for colluding with Russia!!!!/s
1 Because he snitched on his brothers.Really though, shouldn't he have talked to them first? Wouldn't there have been a better way to handle this in your opinion?
1 But he will still cover for Trump? 
8 When it serves his agenda.
1 I agree with this, like Pence sucks but this is really irrelevant to his politics. It’s a dick move that he did that yeah but digging up old dirt that’s as minor as this doesn’t really accomplish anything. 
22 Seems unlikely that he was against underage and irresponsible drinking. He was the one who oversaw the alcohol being brought in. It was only after the dean showed up that he jumped on the morally wrong bandwagon. 
9 Plus, he was a kid.  Everybody calm the fuck down.  He screwed up...on *being a bro*.  It's not like he Brock-Turner'd a bitch.
1 Healthcare for poor people? If you're poor and can't afford healthcare, you should die. But I draw the line at fraternity hazing!
4 I wish I could give this more upvotes
1 After reading the article, it seems like he threw them under the bus to keep from getting himself into trouble.
1 Lol someone didn't get a bid.
1 Not to condone binge drinking or anything but kegs aren't what's killing these freshman pledges. No one dies from drinking too much beer, you just get bloated and throw up. The problem lies with universities allowing hard liquor and hazing rituals involving chugging hard liquor. On my bid night for my fraternity I blacked out within 5 minutes just because of what I was forced (highly suggested) to drink. These kids come on campus willing to do whatever it takes to join a fraternity and are easily pressured into drinking heavily especially around elder fraternity members and super hot girls.
-41 It's not frats who get freshman killed, it's the freshman who get themselves killed by being uneducated and irresponsible of THEMSELVES.
1 Today?
1 Former Democratic Rep. was just sentenced to five years in prison for charity fraud -> lets talk about Pence's college fraternity
1 Correct the Record is mad about the GOP tax bill passing.
1 Yes this one post has ruined the entire sub.
1 OH my, I'm guessing you did not read the article? Unless, you mean by honest that he was an active part of rule breaking until caught, then sold his friends/brothers out? Totally honest. The kind of principles we need in office. Amirite?!
1 At this point I would be really unsettled if they began to learn. 
1 What a weird time we're in where people are angry that a politician refused to break the rules and lie for his friends. 
1 It’s not. Look how hard these idiots are jerking each other in this thread. 
5 Okay Worf. 
-48 Your saying that it's honorable to betray your school?
1 Doesn't matter because he's still under suspicion for betraying his oath to uphold the Constitution. If he wanted to redeem himself, rat out POTUS. 
1 So you'd prefer a vice president that wouldn't call out his political acquaintances for breaking the rules? Got it. Maybe you really are #withher
-3 That makes me wonder if old Agnew II will fall first.
1 Can't believe he doesn't go to dinner with women other than his wife. What a piece of shit!
1 You know that that whole “mother” thing, not eating with other women at lunch, all the God stuff is only pandering to the base. I guarandamnteeya he is nothing close to a Christian.  They use God for political purposes because their actions are so far from what God would approve of ...So I’m skeptical of sociopaths that rise to power and invoke the God card.  Separation of Church & State.Let the government run the business of the country and let the churches spread the word!
1 Gay sex. Very shameful and hidden but lots of cock.
1 Some universities don't allow them in fraternity houses or at fraternity parties. Basically nobody follows this rule. 
1 Now is drinking a keg more or less degenerate than trying to cheat on your pregnant wife by taking a woman furniture shopping and moving on her “like a bitch”
1 'wrong' when most other countries have a drinking age of 18 and it's perfectly fine.
1 ...it's not the onion, that's the whole point
1 The vp is a loser? On what grounds do you consider yourself more of a winner than the Vice President of the United States?
4 A loser that'll do much more than you'll ever do in your lifetime.
1 Right. We need people who will keep their mouth shut when there's illegal things going on in our government. 
2 Just wait, if it gets down to the marrow then he will roll on Trump so fast it will set a world record.
1 How does this even make sense?  
1 Like the gay people would be if Mike "Shocks not cocks" Pence had his way?
1 You folks are literally the only ones bringing up Hillary these days. Probably because that’s all you can do to convince yourself Trump is worth anything 
3 Mother do you think I should run for president 
1 I believe in my day we called this a Poindexter.  A kind of superlative of Milquetoast.
1 Yeah, better to take advantage of women like Weinstein did! Morals are so 5 minutes ago. 
1 > obvious collusion with a foreign nationhave any evidence to support this claim?
1 No, they're making fun of a tight ass who can't let his brothers have the least amount of fun. 
1 >Eat outOh
1 And topping the list of sex tapes nobody wants to see...
-1 Don't forget ditches. 
1 So come out already
1 Oooooh I love this feeling!
1 Had a similar experience did you soyboy? 
-2 Snitches get snitches. Hardee harr 
1 "We need the dues!"
1 Yeah, every fraternity had a method to black ball active members and kick them out. It's not a simple majority vote in any I'm aware of though, and I remember from my days (only did it once) that it was more than supermajority
1 They can vote him out, they can do it for whatever reason they want. I think there's probably something missing here.
1 [I made this for a completely different story about Pence,](https://i.imgur.com/XodAPPk.png) but it is every bit as relevant here.
1 Fun fact. King James was gay. Actual quote, "Jesus had John. I have George."
1 So everybody just fucked before 11. 
1 Friend has 5 roommates who are all evangelical. They do not allow any girls to sleep over at all, not even girlfriends
1 > no girls past 11pm ruleGays fly under the radar once again.
1 funny, i went to colelge to learn, and even though i was a non mormon in a mormon college, it wasn't that hard to just follow the rules so i could get my education.
1 By the time I got to grad school I would have been happy to rent to someone who didn't let my roommates' boyfriends move in and trash the place.
1 Whoa 
1 GOP: Grand Ole Pedophiles."Family Values" LOL
1 I always liked “Pence looks like he’s about to introduce anti-mutant legislation”
735 Colbert does great descriptions of people :)- [alter egos 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCyXdJ_KHTk)- [alter egos 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUJS6tE8jjE)- [alter egos 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STxnzd3Rp-A)- [alter egos 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNnavnA5z9E)- [alter egos 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5TojV-qu9I)"Former national security advisor and before picture in a laxative ad, Michael Flynn.""Attorney general and pixie watching you have sex from behind the clover leaf, Jeff Sessions."
1 He's wearing the classic *dammit-must-not-fart-on-camera* face, a staple of Republican politics since the 1990s.
1 I once heard Adam Levin described as the human equivalent of a leather wrist cuff, which I thought was pretty accurate. Wish I could remember who said it.
1 >Haha me too thanks for the karma 
1 White guy number 4 from central casting 
-49 Attacking on looks/appearance is fine if it's a conservative. One standard for me another for thee...Edit: haha downvotes bc you know it’s true. Hit a nerve.
167 Snitches get stitches. 
69 Well he also took money from the first campaign he ever ran to pay his bills haha... It wasn't illegal at the time, but damn, ain't that some shit.Wants to talk tax cuts and fiscal responsibility, he's using campaign money to pay for groceries and his wife's car.
13 so now you know he'll report any wrongdoing, what a great VP!
1 Im not understanding. Is the criticism here that he's too close a stickler for the rules?Boy, thats something we need less of in Washington!
5 came here to say, that tells you everything you need to know about Mike Pence
1 Mike “Jesus Made me Do It” Pence
44 But he acts like he’s from the past. 
10 There are many Pences
31 Baby man is my nickname for my poodle. Don’t ruin it please.
13 I wonder how MrBabyMan is doing these days?
1 *I wanna be an actor*
1 Except all of his stats are pre-maxed like a super boss who was never meant to be played by mortals. 
1 He's the kind of randomly generated Sim that sets fires in his own house
1 !isbot grizzlybjj
229 He renounced his citizenship. Canadian no more!
1 But it does sound like something the zodiac killer would do.
1 Roy Moore was expelled from the Mall, Ted Cruz was expelled from Canada. Not sure which is worse.
1 He probably apologized after
1 That'll get you a kick right in the Tim Bits.
1 It’s crazy that when you run for public office, your past gets torn apart like this. We’ve all done stupid stuff in our lives, but you and I don’t really have to worry about defending it beyond those who were involved. Anyone can lie or exaggerate or bring up stuff that was already resolved.
1 Am I missing something? He used to jack off, and he made a mess. Thats literally all I did in college
1 That's twitter thread is so cringey on the roomates behalf...... dude talked about a normal conversation like it was some crazy thing 
1 My former boss was in the same Harvard class and lived in the same building as them.  He said everyone hated Cruz.
151 Except Pettigrew actually killed a lot of people.
5 Nah man it’s his final move to turn into the zodiac killer.
1 Your a wizard Teddy!
1 >Ted Cruz thinks people don't have a right to "stimulate their genitals." I was his college roommate. This would be a new belief of his.haha best one.
1 I met a girl at a bar who proudly stated she worked for his campaign and showed me a picture with her and Ted.  
30 Even the the giant underground fungus that spawned Ted Cruz hates him.
1 I like ted Cruz more than any other republican. I always have a Chevy Cruze so maybe I’m biased on cruzes. 
1 I mean nobody likes the serial groper either. Probably not the best source.
1 Grad school at Harvard
144 Gambling on campus?
56 Isn't gambling officially restricted in a lot of places? I'm sure universities must sometimes have policies restricting it (not that it will often be enforced)
1 Gambling over a certain amount of money is illegal unless you're at a casino. (In the US)
3 Lmao yah bud, that’s it. 
-11 keep thinking that as you sit in class with single mothers and meth heads LOL
236 He was in Phi Gamma Delta (fiji).
142 I needed a good laugh, thank you
1 >Phi Sigma Gamma. Brit here, we see this all the time in US teen movies. WTF is it??
0 I thought it was Kappa Omega Kappa
0 I thought it was Guy Ramma Guy.
1 Nice one Dad!
1 Or maybe Kappa Kappa Kappa

1 It was Phi Gamma Delta.

45 Why did I click that link at work...
17 Why did I click that...
1 I need a captain what's in the link?! :o
1 Hahahha next for initiation you have to Suck my dick bro HAHaHahAh
1 To be fair, be fair to fair be it fair or not fair. Fair thee well.
1 After all those why did I click that link posts I was expecting a lot worse.It's just dudes with dicks out for the might clickers.For the very very curious, buddies jerking off features some surprisingly huge dicks. Like impressive, straight or not
21 To the Pit of Misery with ye all!
1 I always hated images like this on articles making fun of people. I get that Pence and Trump are jokes, I just hate seeing out of context images being placated as them going "whoopsie!!!"
1 Pretty sure Trump's is him trying to smile or look deep in thought. That creature doesn't know what shame is.
245 They should all leave and form a new fraternity, one without him. You know... like that Simpsons episode
1 Drinking age when he was in college was 18. It has nothing to do with underage consumption of alcohol. More likely they were breaking a tenant agreement.
1 Believe it or not, there are actually a lot of fraternity and sorority members (and especially alumni and donors) who take their experience very seriously and believe it made them better people and more successful.  I wound up married to someone who was president of her sorority (honestly, I expected prison or cancer as more likely outcomes when I was in college) and there are a ton of people involved Greek life who are insanely pissed every time some chapter or its members fucks up, and not just because it's bad PR.   My wife was a chapter adviser after we were married, and I've overheard her reading the riot act to chapter members/leadership who fucked up in some way.I haven't totally discarded the notion I had in college that the Greek system attracts assholes and fuckups -- too much first hand experience (but *what a party!*), but I must concede that there are some people who take it seriously and get something out of it. There's no way donors and alumni are invested in only turning out Belushi-grade drunks looking to roofie coeds for anal.In this way, whatever Pence's other problems, it's kind of hard to not give him some credit for living up to the commitments actually expected of him.  
1 Was in a chapter where something similar happened, in order to actually toss him you’d need approval from national. And National doesn’t officially approve of keggers. Half the chapter never spoke to them again, and they went voluntarily inactive. 
0 Yea because it seems after that he really seemed like an outcast totally unable to use his connections to advance to public office or anything...
1 Because frat boys are more concerned about optics than the GOP
1 I was the head of the judicial board of my fraternity for two years, and this is exactly it. A lot of times, there has to be communication between the chapter, and the nationals or general headquarters of the fraternity, so any punishment such as kicking someone out would have to be relayed to higher ups, and if they knew of the situation at hand, a reason to kick him out would have to be manufactured. Huge pain in the ass. 
1 Sounds a lot like our current political situation.
1 "Dude booze LMAO" - reddit, 2017
1 it's not against the rules to betray your brothers?  that's a weird fraternity...
1 Fuck nationals.
-1 That's right! All negative news about the Trump admin is FAKE NEWS SAD!Jesus Christ you people are pathetic
1 Jesus
39 And installed as national security advisers for a day!
43 A Pence is worth 0.79 Rubles. 
1 Exactly. It's the perfect place to show this scumbag off. 
1 > Integrity? Getting your bros fined for underage drinking isn't going to make the world a better place...It literally comes down to lying, or not lying. I don't really care what your bro code says about not ratting out your friends.
56 I mean, it's a weird thing, and it isn't exactly a sign that he's super in-touch with the real world of 2017, but yeah, better than being a cheater, by far. 
116 Possibly because it's ridiculous to imply that he can't even share a room with a woman without the temptation of infidelity?
13 I don't get why people made a big deal about this. I think it's just his rule and it doesn't mean that he would be unfaithful to his wife if he were to have dinner with another woman, but people keep interpreting it as such. Even if he were to have fear of being unfaithful doesn't it show great self control that he is able to abstain from the situation? Given the allegations about sexual harassment/assault flying around today you might see many more people take this same measure.
10 Could be all those rape allegations everyone seems to be claiming
1 Dining with the Vice President gives an advantage to whomever is in the room. It is sexist to only allow men that opportunity. 
23 If you literally can’t be around women out of fear that you’ll do something terrible, there’s something wrong with you. 
11 It's because it puts all the responsibility on women for his 'faith.'  It implies the only thing stopping him from constantly cheating on his wife is that he is never alone with a (non-wife) woman.  If that is how he wants to conduct himself in private life, fine.  But as a public official, it actually creates some serious issues.  For instance, no woman in government (senator, etc.) can take a private meeting with Pence, while his male colleagues certainly can.  It creates some odd imbalances between who has influence, or the ability to influence, among other things.
16 You want a VP that has so little self control that the mere act of sitting alone at a table with a women for an hour makes him cheat on his wife?Food must really make him horny
10 It's bad because pretty much means he cant work with women without a chaperone (the original quote was he doesnt like being alone with other women, dining/working/etc).  It's arrogant because he assumes every female is tripping head over heel just to get him alone (rofl).  It's weird because if thats the only way to prevent yourself from jumping on top of a woman, how moral are you really?
1 To all the people saying that this is an acceptable method of preventing impropriety, or the appearance of impropriety, it’s not. One-on-one interactions are a critical part of almost all business and social environments. If we live in a society where women are not able to have one-on-one interactions with men, but men are able to interact in that way with each other, we do not live in an equal society. For the Vice President of the United States to hold this belief, which goes against our most core value, equality, is a very big deal. 
0 If that rule is what kept him faithful, then I have doubts on his sincerity. For a comparative example, let's say you drive at or under the speed limit because you toe the line. Do you actually want to drive under the speed limit, or do you only do it because there is a rule?I'm not saying he is faithful for this reason, but damn, all that rule does is keep him appearing "correct" in the eyes of other certain people who consider such things really important. People that I'd argue have outdated perspectives on the social lives of Americans.
6 Not only is it weird, he's excluding an entire gender from working with him.  A lot of work in Washington is done over dinners.  Since his wife hasn't been elected to do shit and would have less than no business at a working dinner meeting, he's basically saying "Sorry women, I'm not going to work with you".  
1 [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/pences-gender-segregated-dinners/521286/) does a good job of explaining why it's at least unfair to women.
0 Because it hampers their ability to falsely accuse him of sexual misconduct.
2 I think people find it weird because they don't feel the urge to cheat on their partners just because they had dinner with someone of the opposite sex. 
1 with all the allegations going around about these other politicians, it shows hes smart by always having his wife around.
1 Having to avoid ever being alone with a woman so you don't cheat on your wife doesn't make you morally sound.
1 It would suck if his superior was a woman and wanted to take him out on a “one to one” lunch to discuss his future. Or if he were the superior and did that sort of thing for the men working for him but not the women. 
1 because it is completely demeaning to every female, as if THEY have no say in the situation? Because it instantly limits the career prospects of every woman in a position to interact with him? Because it is fucking stupid?
2 It's weird that he has to do that to remain faithful to his wife. If the only reason he hasn't sexually assaulted anyone, or hasn't cheated on his wife in a consensual affair is because he refuses to be alone with other women, that doesn't say a whole lot about him/
-1 If dinner with a colleague is enough to tempt him into cheating, than he isn't trustworthy or has zero self control.
1 He has that little self control?I'm alone with women all the time as part of my job. I don't suddenly fuck them all. It'd be silly for my girlfriend to ask me to start bringing in a third party every time a student wanted to meet me in my office or get lunch.
1 You don't think the fact that he only looks at women as sexual objects isn't fucked up? Because that's what he's basically saying. 
-2 Doesn't that say something about him if literally being alone with another woman is enough to tempt him to cheat? There are plenty of reasons why this guy is literal trash.
-3 I think people find it disconcerting because it gives the implication that left alone with a woman he wouldn't be able to stay faithful to his wife. It says that this is an adult man who, contrary to everything else he says, lacks the moral fiber to remain faithful to his wife and would most likely try to get in another woman's pants if given half the chance through the simple act of being alone with her. To me that's a pretty shitty relationship, and really can't say it's built on love and trust.It also means that he can't fathom a world in which he can be alone with a female co-worker talking about legislation with no ulterior motive. He can't picture himself being able to go to a woman neighbor's house alone if she knocks on the door and needs help with something. He can't even see himself as having a platonic woman friend from work or school or church that he could just meet for coffee and talk to as a friend.It says quite a bit about who he is as a person that one chance of solitude with another woman and he's afraid he'll throw his whole life down the drain
-1 [removed]
8 Actually, many would argue that he is a bad politician, as did some of the people interviewed for this article that referenced the keg story. >[Before Trump picked him for VP he was] he was an embattled small-state governor with underwater approval ratings, dismal reelection prospects, and a national reputation in tatters. He isn't what his own state likes, and he gave up his integrity to his ambition to be president.
3 > that has nothing to do with integrity.He's a liar, and he lies to cover for other liars while they do evil things. That has a *lot* to do with integrity. 
1 12 years? more like 4
1 He was a one term governor who wasn’t even going to get re-elected in a red state. He wasn’t a 12 year governor.
1 This would be an option if it were a statement made in a vacuum and we had no idea what was going on in the white house, but that isn't the case. In college, he told the truth to the authorities, even though it meant going against peer pressure, and everyone around him getting in trouble. The authorities are knocking right now, and Pence's mouth is firmly glued shut. And we *know* there are crimes being committed. 
3 It's integrity to hold people accountable for their actions without lying about what is happening. Being a narc is shitty, but it's honest. 
1 Lol the whole frat was at fault why shouldn't it be punished?
114 Neither is a good thing. If people want to drink in college (most people), leave them alone.
22 "dangerous and illegal activity" hahahahaha
1 Reporting drinking in college of all places just kinda makes you a dick
1 Perhaps he know the president better than you do.
1 Not to take those 2 jackasses side but all politicians are pathological liars.. there is no way we would elect someone that told the truth about what needs to be done, our unfunded liabilities will sink us before we get an honest politician 
1 damn, saying a lying politician is a bad thing gets a lot of karma.  I might as well say the sky is blue at this point.  Christ.  It's literally a game of who can lie better.
0 Omg I hate you so much.
1 >like what lies?[Here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html) are some.[Here](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false/) are some more.
15 *bee-yuw
1 Well, I mean, he didn't wanna look like a pussy
3 *GASP* That's like suggesting he might dine with a woman other than his wife alone. So scandalous for a man as boring as Mike Pence. 
1 Considering 50 years ago most Christian organizations considered Woodstock, musical festivals, rock music and its inhabitants as Godless heathens, I’m kinda happy to see them enjoying  themselves with their own little “Woodstock” festival, as corny and cheesy as it may be to someone like myself. 
5 That's until I hit them with the acid.  You are all about to have a very personal experience with God, indeed!
1 I went to a Christian rock festival when I was in high school, since my girlfriend at the time was super religious, and I was to some degree. It was literally the most cringey thing I have ever witnessed. The Newsboys took like 20 minutes during their set to pray. It was horrible. 
1 Clearly you should be listening to Kid Rock and Buckcherry instead of umamerican homosexual baroque pop.
1 I'm a Trump supporter and Pet Sounds is my favorite piece of music. I'm dead serious when I make that statement, too. inb4 people think I run around immediately buying into conspiracies, the word cuck, and other general tinhat bullshit.
110 To quote Hank Hill, "You're not making Jesus cooler, you're just making rock worse."
6 It's bad if you're trying to party. 
5 because christianity/religion is lame duh /s
6 Reasons, apparently. 
17 Because this is Reddit now shut up while the atheists circlejerkIt's not unlike when the story broke that Pence doesn't go out to dinners and events alone with other women than his wife, and most people here twisted that into him being a sexist pig. It's not bad in itself, just bad because a Republican does it.
1 Hating religion is cool on Reddit nowadays 
1 The comment you were responding to is typical of the depth of opinion  and level of reasoning many of us on reddit have.
1 No no, it's cool guys! He's saying he's a rat, not a snitch.
1 Buddy Friend, right? /s
1 And this is why we've had multiple fraternity deaths this year. FSU's president shut down ALL of greek life because of it, and he was part of a fraternity in college. Maybe rat your brothers out if they're being fucking reckless
1 Or any peer. Not just Greek bs
1 Ummm, kegs are a big part of binge drinking culture. It's the combination of keg stands and hard liquor that lead to underestimating just how bad off you are. Not to mention, if you can get kegs you can get liquor. 
45 It's irresponsible hazing rituals where pledges are pressured into drinking way more than they would normally. 
1 Some frat tied a dude up and force fed him beer...
1 Someone hasn't been to college...
1 No, genius.  The posts that are daily just /r/politics copies have.
1 Mike Pence is basically the anti-Bill Clinton.
1 They’ll push anything to distract from tax reform or any of the real problems we have in this country. 
1 Can you imagine what Worf must have been like in college?
38 LMAO @ "betray your school"
1 No but TIL, it's honorable to be dense and a buzz kill. Glad you're at all the parties.
11 Its a fucking keg idiot
16 it's more dishonorable to betray your brothers.  what pence did (if it is true) is unforgivable
1 dude i betray my school every wednesday^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^disclaimer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^i^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^don't
1 You're saying you'd betray a brother for your school?
1 College is just another institution that looks out for itself. If you don't look out for your brothers/sisters/fellow classmates, you're a fucking piece of shit snitch. End of story.
1 He prefers a Vice President that touched children 
1 I can't believe he doesn't break rules! Even if they are dumb what a scum bag 
1 [deleted]
1 it’s weird that he can only see women in a sexual manner. like never once was there a meeting that was with just a singular woman? It’s so bizarre, it’s on the same level of muslim women not being able to talk to other man, operating off the assumption that adult human beings can. just. not. fuck. 
1 it would be degenerate if he was actually cheating, aka his wife not knowing, but we don't know this. 
1 What! But it is illegal! Are you actually justifying illegal behaviour simply because it is legal in other countries?? It is illegal. I just think it is stupid because this is exactly the attitude that meant the 'soft' bullying I got in primary school was never reported. The whole attitude that 'oh, it wasn't *that* bad, don't rat him out'.
1 I fucked up...
1 “They’re making fun of daddy on the internet!!! I gotta defend him with “no you!!!” level insults!!”
1 What if I wanted to be an amicable human being, and didn't give a fuck about being the Vice President of the United States?
1 least i'm not a bitch
1 This statement is the worst kind of defense. "He did more than you so far so hes better than you". Bitch nearly caused an HIV epidemic.
1 He’s certainly tried to electrocute more gays than I have. Point in his column I guess.
1 Yeah, terrible things. He’s a sack of shit
1 >A loser that'll do much more than you'll ever do in your lifetime.haha you're triggered. and what has pence done? lmao he hasn't contributed anything positive to the world what so ever.
1 I know.  I could never hope to spread HIV like he has.  
1 idk id definitely take being a normal teenager over being vice president 
1 Nope, just miffed at the miscarriage of Justice. She's on record lying to the FBI, Congress, and the American people multiple times, has the director of the FBI lay out that she, line by line, broke the law in regards to handling TS documents and walks, she allowed an ambassador and 4 service members to be murdered to hide the gunrunning taking place in northern Africa, and sold 20% of the nation's uranium resources to Russia in exchange for millions in donations to the Clinton foundation and increased speaking fees for Bill. Maybe the media should be reporting on this instead of sexually assaulting each other all the time.
1 “Mother should i run for President”“Mother should i trust the government”
1 This was about ratting out illegal campus activity, yes?
1 You can have fun without breaking the campus regulations and possibly several laws.
1 and the Office of Vice President of the United States.
1 I already have. Wanna fingerbang?
1 "Goddammit, Jimmy! His chill to pull ratio is 0:0!"
1 Am I the only one that read that as Hangover College?
1 I didn't punch him because he was gay. I punched him...and then he happened to turn out to be gay afterwards.
1 I know in mine it required a 3/4 vote (can never remember if 3/4 or 2/3 is supermajority) and we only have had like ten guys in our chapter (just turned 100) ever be expelled, so it's definitely rare.
1 2/3rds vote to remove somebody from their position, 3/4trs to remove them from the fraternity if you go by Robert's Rules
1 Yea my chapter has the house rule of 66% of brothers at a chapter meeting that meets quorum (80% of active brotherhood). So its pretty tough to get that many frat brothers in one place at one in and of itself, but it's not impossible if the person in question has done enough to warrant that kind of turnout. 
1 I'd imagine it depends on the constitution. Ours was supermajority though. It was very hard to blackball someone and was taken seriously when it had to be done. 
1 What made you give the person the boot?
1 It depends. Kicking someone out required a unanimous decision from all active brothers and a trial where both sides were allowed to make their case to the chapter.So when I was in college it was not taken lightly. We only kicked out one person and that was for literally trying to stab another member. He was also eventually convicted by a real jury and in a mental institution for a while.
1 Well, if it was a private Christian University or college (it was) then they probably have strict rules about this sort of thing, making it impossible for the fraternity to 'black ball' someone for doing the right thing. In fact, they would probably be harshly punished... and guess what - I read the article and they were!>“They really raked us over the coals. The whole house was locked down,” Murphy told the magazine.>Pence’s brothers were furious with him, but he maintained a good relationship with the administration. In fact, he was so beloved by school officials that Hanover offered him a job after he graduatedAlso, Pence broke protocol not just out of a sense of moral superiority, but to save his own skin:>This was a major departure from the fraternity’s usual practice: Whoever answered the door took the blame for the booze so the whole house wasn’t formally disciplined, according to Murphy
1 That's so absurd. Seems so damn immature to me. I can understand holding those standards for yourself, but to have to have explicit rules around it just signals that you are not an adult.
1 Don't forget Skippy!
1 This reads like a tacky Facebook post.
1 Funny how all the pedos that've been recently exposed are liberals tho 
1 No, he's the government official that dumps billions of dollars into creating a "cure."
1 “Jeff sessions, Senator, and Confederate house elf” Jesus fucking Christ lmao  
63 I’m so glad he brought that over from Colbert Report.
19 Whoever writes these is amazing.
171 True, but god is his band annoying. 
16 Jesus. Those descriptions write a whole Family Guy bit in your head. 
1 Holy shit, Penis Rice A Roni I’m *dead.*
1 Confederate house elf is my favorite.
1 I should be studying for my finals...I *should be*But instead, I watched all of these and then rewatched 2 and 3.
1 There was one I watched today where he described trump's lawyer as the Norse god of sadness and it almost made me choke 
1 Damn that's so funny I wanna give you gold! But i'm broke :(
1 Colbert referring to Pence as looking like he forgot to become an astronaut will always be my favorite. 
1 His impressions of Scarramucci were the funniest I've seen him do in a while.
1 I still laugh over the Penis Rice a Roni
1 you mean Colbert's writers do great descriptions of people. 
1 Remindme! 4 hours
1 Don't forget Ham Rove
24 If you're butthurt, would you prefer that we discuss how Mike Pence is a [total piece of shit](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-radical-crusade-of-mike-pence-w462223) that even Trump joked wants to hang the gays?
15 They're saying he's bland, not that he looks like a default avatar.
1 yeah, because conservatives *never* attack someone based on their looks, no sirree
9 By all means, make fun of liberal's appearances too.

1 I came here exactly to write this! 
1 Shoutout to Lilo. 
1 Lol beat me to it
1 Snitches get ~~stitches~~ put in office.
1 This is weird to me. Wouldn't you want a snitch in the Trump administration?
0 I'm not saying Pence has this quality I'm about to describe, but I'm trying really hard to live my life in a way that people know that my word means something. That being said, if my friends had a keg and the law asked me about it, I might ask to see a warrant, but I'd have to be honest once it all plays out. Real friends don't expect you to lie to the cops for them. 
-1 Talk shit get hitBitches get stitches There’s probably more but thought I’d add some here. 
1 Better than spending it on weapons and sending it to terrorists like the last two presidents or spending it on kids like the last VP
1 Maybe that's why they didn't let mike Flynn tell him beforehand about the Russia conversations.
1 He's the Anti-Biden.
1 These two comments sound like lyrics
1 The present might turn out to just be a strange aberration.
1 There's a name I haven't seen in a long time....
1 Its Mr President babyman to you
1 The cops were getting pretty close, he had to do something.  Hard to believe he was the Scarborough rapist.
1 Can I have it then? 
1 don't need people like him
1 Bullshit he was born there and raised till he was 4 or 5 he's Canadian, renounce or not we're not claiming him. 
1 Fuck that. Even I have standards. Fuck Ted Cruz.
1 Canada probably has higher standards so getting kicked out of the mall is worse.
1 Roy Moore was also twice expelled from the Alabama Supreme Court.How you can be dumb enough to believe there are towns in the USA under Sharia law and also make it to the Supreme Court in any state is the real mystery...
1 ~~Paul Blart, Mall Cop~~ Roy Moore, Mall Diddler
1 Roy Moore. No one cares aboot canada
1 I want to believe but I don't think he knows how to apologize.
1 Similarly, according to Dan Savage, who was a roomate of Rick Santorum, he was paid a 7 figure NDA about Rick's behavior in college.  Savage then goes on to make Santorum's name synonymous with the frothy lube and fecal matter mix that comes about during anal sex.   
1 It's different when you run for public office on a platform of decency and judgement of others. Then you better be perfect or shut up
1 But you admit you did versus saying no one should ever do that
1 In conjunction with his ridiculous anti-sex and anti-masturbation beliefs, the guy’s a ~~wacko that jacko’s~~ hypocrite.
146 Yeah, because he was less of a bitch.

71 A poker game among friends is perfectly legal as long as “the house” doesn’t take a cut. 
5 Oh I guess I just figured by the time they would be in college they should be able to play poker but I suppose dorms expecially can be pretty strict on those types of rules. I would have figured in a game among friends there wouldn't be any repruccussions but if he owed a bunch of money than it probably wasn't a game with friends.
1 I don’t know  of any law like that.Home poker game legality varies state to state.
1 It may also have been that I didn't apply to Harvard but that's beside the point.
1 Was raised by a single mom so nothing against them, and saw little to no meth heads in my community college.  Now I work with ivy league graduates as well as high school graduates because IT doesn't care how you learned what you know, just that you can do it. 
1 I'm guessing you're 18-20 years old. 
118 Fiji's at my school were major partiers. Can't imagine me they would have let in someone like Pence.
1 Shouldn't it be fidgety (fi gi di)?
1 God damn it, for real? Another reason for me to regret pledging that house.
1 Damnit! I'm a Phi Gam as well. At least, he didn't go to Texas Tech. 
1 The running joke about Fiji at my school was phi gam butt ram
1 He wasn’t a Tri Lambda?
1 Lol he was a Fiji? That's fucking funny

19 Are you talking about "Homer the Great" where all the Stonecutters quit and formed the society of no Homers?
11 The No Pences Frat.But then they let one Pence in?
8 "But you guys let in Hunter Pence""It says no Pence*S*, we're allowed to have one"
5 But you let Mike Glumplich in!
1 That’s actually how a lot of the fraternities were created. Mine was formed after 7 members of DKE disagreed with the fraternal leadership and left to start Sigma Chi.
1 It's against the rules to be drinking underage, and fraternities are still beholden to those rules and officially have to support them.
1 It’s against the unwritten rules. We had something like this in my fraternity. Kid was vilified for ratting us out. Not officially kicked out of the house because nationals would know exactly why he was ousted, which is no good when they have a say over your social and financial situation. 
1 Yep, better not report your “bros” for date raping girls either. What a tool of a human being you are.
1 Are you a fucking idiot?
1 Hey, at least I wasn't a traveling consultant trying to bust people.

1 But we all lie... Integrity (to most people) means trying to make the world a better place. He actively does the opposite.Edit: I think I might be full of shit. But then again, aren't we all?
1 It's probably more of a safe guard against any accusations.
35 I'd hope that a Vice-President would have the self-restraint to eat with someone without nailing them. 
11 Honestly it seems to be more based on the misogynistic evangelical "women are all scheming whores that want to tempt you away from Jesus" thing.
-4 It sounds like he IS a cheater. That's why he can't be alone with other women. If you can't safely be next to a bottle of alcohol, you're an alcoholic.

61 Maybe he just wants to avoid rumors or accusations?
91 Yeah, you can make fun of him for that statement all you want, but after all these sexual harassment claims coming up from everywhere against politicians, Mike Pence is getting the last laugh. 
22 Or possibly he wants a third person as a witness just in case allegations fly?
37 With all the accusations, seems like he was the smart one.
42 Maybe it’s not the temptation, it just makes sure there are never even any questions. It also is respectful towards his wife. It doesn’t hurt anyone and seems to err on the side of caution. He’s a VP, I’m glad he’s careful. 
1 or allegations of infidelity
1 It isn’t so much that he’s  afraid what he will do, more like what other people assume he is doing. Let’s face it, anytime workers see the boss go to dinner 2 times a week with a woman, people are always going to assume something is going on between them...so why put yourself in a position to have unsubstantiated rumors of  inappropriate relationships flying around about your personal life? I understand how it can get twisted around to “oh he’s afraid she will jump his bones” or..oh he’s afraid he’ll jump her bones” but i really don’t think that’s the case.
1 I don't get it either. It's as if women should be treated as people and not as sexual objects that make men go crazy and lose control of themselves. Like they aren't just sitting there, begging for the D.
28 I don't know about Pence, but sometimes it's not exactly just about the person not having any self control. Sometimes men won't be willing to be alone with a woman to protect themselves from any seeming impropriety. For example, I got into a discussion with this one dude that happened to be a pastor and he thought it was fine to pray alone with a woman and give her counseling advice. He seemed to almost have a naive idea that nothing would happen because he had confidence in himself. I didn't really know the guy enough to know if he was really that innocent or what, but my stance was that it didn't matter if he did have self control or not, but that appearing to do something questionable was enough for other people to accuse one of being improper. Sure enough a couple months later he was counseling a married woman alone at his church and some church member drove by, saw the two cars, and a rumor spread that they were having an affair. I have no idea if they really had an affair or not, but it was enough to get the dude banished from the church and the lady labeled some kind of homewrecker.There will always be at least one person who wishes for those in any kind of position to fall, if even for the gossipy entertainment value of it all.
18 its a general rule to follow, doesn't mean that you fear doing something terrible.
22 Look at everything that is happening now with accusations flying around like crazy and the fact that nowadays accusation = guilty in the court of public opinion. I would say he is a pretty fucking smart guy with great foresight.
1 It isn’t so much that he’s  afraid what he will do, more like what other people assume he is doing. Let’s face it, anytime workers see the boss go to dinner 2 times a week with a women, people are always going to assume something is going on between them...so why put yourself in a position to have unsubstantiated rumors of  inappropriate relationships flying around about your personal life?

-2 What is the point of being with another woman alone if you are in a committed relationship? 
1 It's not about faith, it's about appearances. If you're a male teacher, you don't have closed door 1 on 1's with young girls - it's just how it is in today's society. 
1 > For instance, no woman in government (senator, etc.) can take a private meeting with Pence, while his male colleagues certainly can. It creates some odd imbalances between who has influence, or the ability to influence, among other things.I have never heard that. Anything I have read has been about dinner or other non-work related extracurricular activities in regards to his policy. Do you have a source stating that he won't have a closed door meeting with a Senator?
1 You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? Sexual misconduct is a damning accusation regardless of the truth or severity of it. Why not just eliminate that as a factor when public figures already have their lives looked over with a microscope? One less thing to worry about. 
41 He probably feels that having dinner alone with someone else has an implied intimacy in our society and doesn't feel comfortable sharing that feeling with anyone but his wife.Can't say I agree with him but I can respect his decision without calling him a horny bastard that can't control his urges for other women.

-23 Or maybe he's just a decent person. Can't say the same about the leftist trash waving the flag of sodomites.
13 It's not like a single accusation of sexual assault could destroy his career or anything, right?
11 No. He is VP of the United States. Obviously he is an extremely unpopular VP. He doesn't want a false rape accusation flying in his face, because you can bet your ass he'd have one if he dined alone with a democrat who was just a little bit too eager to discredit the Trump administration.
1 Seriously. The idea that men and women can't have a professional working relationship has been used as justification for keeping women (not men) out of the workforce. 
1 You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? Especially when everyone and their mom is getting accused of sexual misconduct, true, exaggerated or otherwise. 
21 Say you're, I don't know, an aspiring politician with goals of being in the White House. What is the single thing that would fuck up all of your work without anything other than circumstantial evidence? A sexual assault accusation.The man doesn't want to dine alone with women because it opens him up to accusations of misconduct, both lawful and unlawful.It is his personal choice to not dine alone with women. Not sure how that is bad or a detriment to his character. 
1 >he's excluding an entire gender from working with him.firstly, did you actually read the passage?and second of all, he’s likely doing it for his wife in the first place
1 Only if the dinner is in a private, one-on-one setting. These likely are not the type of dinners that work gets done over.
5 Bingo.
5 It’s so he can’t even be accused. With all of the things coming out lately, why isn’t this a bright spot? 
1 >It's weird that he has to do that to remain faithful to his wifeI believe it is all about optics. It isn't that he needs it, it's that this prevents even the accusation or allegation that he is acting inappropriately. 
1 You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? 
1 You can't ever be accused of inappropriate behavior if you are never put in the situation that could lead to an accusation.
1 You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? 
1 Yeah, it’s not like false sexual misconduct allegations could potentially ruin a political career. 
1 Think about that for a second, friend. Political hopeful.Young career.Lovely wife and family.What is the one thing that could derail all that? Any guesses?
1 I really agree, people I speak to don't seem to know that Pence was pretty much finished and a deeply unpopular and unpleasant man. I really wish the press would spend more time on Pence and his agenda.
0 Hey at least you did some research!
0 Tell me right now how he's a liar.  No Google.  Go.
1 >  And we know there are crimes being committed.    Lol ok buddy
1 Maybe you're one of those people who likes to comment without reading, so let me help you out:>Pence “was not a particularly hard partier” but oversaw his brothers’ complicated plans to sneak alcohol into the house and was in charge of ironing out any issues with adults if things went wrong>During one rowdy bash, the brothers found out a dean was coming to the house and tried to hide evidence of their illicit activities, according to the article.>The future vice president greeted the dean at the door and proceeded to direct him straight to the kegs, telling the official they belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, his former brother saidThere is no integrity being displayed by Pence in this story. None. Zero. "Integrity" in this case would be reporting the rule breaking BEFORE the dean showed up, or you know, refusing to be a party to it in the first place.The word you are looking for is "cowardice".
1 Since when did integrity have anything to do with licking the boots of authority?  I always thought integrity was doing what is right when nobody else is looking.  Just because the rules in place mean you should behave one way, doesn't mean that's the right way to behave.  
1 Honor among thieves. It's not like he joined a frat thinking that they didn't throw parties. I'm sure he had plenty of chances to jump ship after finding out how they picked a scapegoat for parties. I'd be willing to bet that he had benefited from the system in past, and turning around and ratting out the entire frat when it was his time to take the fall is incredibly shitty. 
1 Falling on the grenade so the rest of your brothers can live another day.
35 I mean, I drank during college, but ultimately its an illegal activity and its not immoral to report it.EDIT: I don't feel like responding to all replies with essentially the same thing, so I'll just say this. You can disagree with a law, but you have to accept the consequences of breaking that law if you choose to break it. If every individual gets to pick and choose which laws the choose to follow based on how they feel about that law, we'd all be living in anarchy. If you all feel strongly that the drinking age should be lowered (I personally do), then contact your representatives, just endorsing that people break the law because you don't like it isn't the solution
1 >If people want to break the law, and break contractual rules they agreed to follow, leave them alone.
2 if they're drinking or acting rowdy in your living space its a different story though.  most colleges don't allow alcohol.  when I was in school my dumbass roommate brought liquor home, used our glasses to serve her friends, then left for the weekend with the empty bottles in the trash and the dirty cups in the sink. if the RA saw those, we would've gotten in trouble and not her.
1 If we're talking "credentials for the Presidency", I'd rather have someone who was _too_ lawful over someone who was... oh, what's the latest government scandal today? Groping kids for dollars, or something?I mean, sure, Pence has his bad points and all, but let's not throw the principle out with the bathwater.
1 why are you subhumans always so butthurt when people report others to the police? Do you have absolutely no superego at all?
1 RA confirmed
1 plenty of college kids die every year at parties, and it used to be WAY worse.
1 oWo Whats this?
1 I think we could use a boring president right about now...
13 I love that quote. It can be applied to some many things when someone tries to blend to things that don't always make sense. I remember being younger hating that show because it meant the Simpson's were over and this dumb redneck show is now on. Now I see how great the writing can really be. I like it more than the Simpson's now
13 Dude I'm a Christian and that sounds like a terrible show.  Christian rock is beyond horrific, except for some metal bands since the iconography of our faith is pretty dark and twisted.
8 Nah, this isn't partisan, he just seems like a humorless SuperChristian™ who is no fun to be around. This kind of "criticism" is along the lines  of people criticizing Trump for getting a well done steak and putting ketchup on it. Its just reddit's code for what is cool and what isnt. 
1 It's like attending an Eat-your-vegetables themed wrestling match. People who can't let fun exist without an overt moral tie-in don't make sense to most people. Do their moral beliefs require this much reinforcement? Is it wrong to simply have fun? Is this preaching in the streets? 
7 Right?  I'm a centre-lefty but I hate how fucking biased we are towards the right.  I actually *really* admire his dining protocol.  It's old fashioned but very admirable.
1 Nowadays? I’m not saying a Christian rock festival doesn’t sound lame as shit, but let’s not pretend reddit has ever liked religion. 
1 The people in this thread are lunatics. Pence did the right thing, kegs are bad. Jesus Christ, this fucking website sometimes.
5 It's irresponsible to join a fraternity with hazing rituals. 
1 It's usually the dumber kinds of hazing (standing in a salt and ice bath) or kids drinking too much thinking that it'll impress the older brothers that get themselves killed. With 0 tolerance for hazing at every school and within every organization, it would be beyond dumb for hazing to still include forcing to binge drink 
1 You're moving the bar. I agree that having fucked up hazing rituals is wrong, but that doesn't mean partying is wrong. 
1 Plenty of frats make a point to not haze. Coincidentally, that includes Fiji, which is Pence's.
-13 That's not where the hospitalizations and deaths come from.... 
11 Come on guys, he's an overall dickhead and horrible person but this one instance of being a weenie is "unforgivable". Get real

44 yeah, like did we really need to hear that at 0:30edit: video number 5 wtf man why did you edit
1 Not the band, but that batiste guy is unfunny as fuck amd he does not know it. He needs to shut up.
1 Not nearly as annoying as Paul Schaeffer.  
1 fucking John Baptiste, I swear he's a talented musician but he just interjects stupid meaningless distracting background commentary, repeating a fraction of whatever the punchline was.  Then follows it up with the most disingenuous, forced, off-cue, cackle of a laugh I've ever heard.
24 Yup, they should take Fallon's band and give it to Colbert. 
1 Amen.Love Colbert, but there is always some guy in the band overselling the jokes. "WHoooooooooooooooooooooo. You gooooooooooot him goooooood."It is just horrible.
9 Jesus we get it. Some people hate Baptiste 
1 Jon, is a phenomenal musician, but has terrible TV stage presence, it must drive the Stage manager nuts.  Fallon, too bad you rubbed Trunpps head and Mitt's balls once too often . Now I don't give a fuck how much the Roots kick ass on your show. The_Tonight show is dead to me.
-11 That's racist
1 they are some of the best bits in the show, the guy who comes up with them is a hero.also, i believe in you! go study, kick ass!
1 i saw that! it was beautiful <3
1 oh you don't have to do that. i hope someone gives you gold for this comment though, you're sweet.
1 Mark "I changed my name from Mike because I didn't want to be associated with myself" PenceEdit: in case anyone's confused, the comment above used to say Mark instead of Mike
1 Mr. Pence does not believe in the witchcraft of wish granting, nor does he condone its use by his fraternity brothers.
6 Mark? Is that his brother?
1 First wish: I want to be President of the United States of America.Genie: **DONE**
1 Wahlberg?
1 Who's Mark Pence?
1 The law? No cops showed up at the door. He directly brought the dean of the school to the kegs.
1 “Real friends don’t expect you to lie to the cops for them.”This is why rats don’t have friends. 
1 he went out of his way to tell the Dean, no questioning from cops occurred 
1 Oh word I missed the news about the legislation that pence pushed through to stop all that other spending. Thanks for the heads up, non biased truth teller.
1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism
1 > spending it on weapons and sending it to terrorists You're telling me that Trump and Obama are using donations to their campaigns to purchase weapons which they gave to terrorists? This is quite a claim that I'm not inclined to believe without something substantial to back it up.
1 You think they used their campaign funds for those things? . . .
1 so....the Digg users never left...explains a lot
1 Whoa! The Zodiac killer is the Scarborough rapist?!

43 This made me laugh so hard. While at the dentist office. If they turn down the gas, I am blaming you.
1 Yeah but Hufflepuffs aren’t people
57 I was curious about the plausibility of this story... so Ted Cruz went to Princeton (in New Jersey). The [STATE OF NEW JERSEY213th LEGISLATURE](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/S1000/746_I1.HTM) says:> Except as authorized under the laws and the Constitution of this State, all  wagers, bets or stakes made to depend upon any race or game, or upon any gaming by lot or chance, or upon any lot, chance, casualty or unknown or contingent event, shall be unlawful.  This section shall apply to any wager, bet or stake made if any party to the transaction is present in this State when the transaction occurs, regardless of the location of any other party to the transaction, and without regard to whether the transaction is conducted in person or through a medium of communication, including but not limited to mail, telephone, television, telegraph, facsimile, cable, wire, satellite, the Internet, wireless network, or other medium of communication.As interpreted [here](http://www.pokerdiy.com/faq/home-poker-law), that means:>The criminal law statues of New Jersey prohibit home poker games and all other forms of social gambling that are not licensed or approved by the stateStill doubt the story, but it's possible. The second link says that only about half of states allow "home poker"
1 I also think the law doesn't want people hosting poker games when thousands of dollars are involved. Things can get messy when that much money is at stake.
4 Most forms of gambling are illegal in most states in the US. Police somewhat frequently raid games to seize the money.https://www.deadspin.com/bets-and-bullets-a-small-time-gamblers-death-by-swat-1677469592/amp
1 Individual chapters are incredibly different at each school
51 I can't imagine Pence's college would've accredited Fiji to begin with.
34 Really? they were huge fucken nerds at my school. First-hand source
15 Same at Hanover (where Pence went) they were really elitist though. Would always talk about being top house, most quit college athletics after a year or two, and not fun for parties; made any guys who weren't Fijis at their house for a party uncomfortable. 
1 European here, what the hell are you all talking about?
1 As a current FIJI I can confirm, would not let him in 
1 At my school they we're the frat that less assholish frats thought were assholes. Other frats always made jokes about how they said they ate steak and lobster. 
0 He's more Omega Mu
1 It changes from school to school man. I'm not involved in it but 90% of my friends are Greek and different chapters can have vastly different reputations. Same goes for sororities. 
1 Really? They are the nerd fraternity around southern Indiana /Kentucky/Tennessee area 
1 At my school they are dry and known as "the anime house"
1 He ratted them out for the keg, not the coke. 
1 Mine were trashy as fuck lol. The only memory i have of them is flipping the beer pong table at a pledge party, spilling beer all over everyone around it, and shouting in my face "pledge bitch pledge" repeatedly. Probably similiar to trumps' "loyalty bitch loyalty" thing these days. 
1 I accidentally started an orgy at a Fiji party once. Shit was wild
139 American fraternities and sororities all use the Greek alphabet for their names. So a fraternity might be called Phi Sigmma Gamma or something like that.The joke is that Deja Vu almost sounds like the name of a fraternity. So the other comment was acting as if it were but correcting it to an actual fraternity name.I’ve never been in a fraternity, so I can’t really give much more info without talking out of my ass.
1 Fraternity's use greek for their names: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, Kappa, Tau, Epsilon, Theta....and so on. Often, the Fratenity's full greek name is abbreviated. A fairly large/well known fraternity is "Tau Kappa Epsilon", is almost universally reffered to as "TKE" (pronounced "Teek"). Obviously, the original joke was about the people of America regretting to vote for him just like his fraternity brothers./u/BobisBadAss's joke is a play on the greek's system of abbreviations.  
-12 Deja Vu is not Greek letters nor a fraternity.
1 > fraternities and sororitiesAnd WTF are these?
1 Lol no problem my man. To each their own
1 Thanks cap'n! You can fly away now.
39 They can have *one* Pence
1 but you let that Pence in!?
64 That's future Simpsons.
18 Actually, forget the fraternity and the blackjack!
3 That would leave him with the funds.
1 Yeah and then the Stonecutters is just Homer and a bunch of monkey Civil War reenactors. 
1 The Penceless society 
10 It says no Mikes, we're allowed one. 
1 Not just rule, but LAW. 
1 nice false equivalency bro
1 What fraternity was it?
1 The way things are going nowadays, it was probably the right move.
1 It's not that at all. It's so he has plausible deniability if someone were to accuse him of sexual harassment or assault. Genius move on his part.
21 Where do you get from "i dont have dinners that could be misconstrued as a date with other women?"
28 Or that he recognizes his own personal weaknesses and doesn't want to put himself in a place where he might be tempted to act inappropriately? I would guess that with his personal rules he has never assaulted/harassed a female coworker or subordinate. 
1 Yeah that’s not a thing. You’re just ignorant and hate that which disagrees with you. 
-2 Well sure, but a true man of God and devotion should have no problem whatsoever resisting that temptation, wouldn't you think? 
1 Let's take a scenario. Mike Pence goes out for dinner with a female colleague. Maybe he even gives her a ride home. Next week's headline: "I was sexually assaulted by Mike Pence!"Even if he was completely innocent and nothing happened, it is his word against hers. Likely, if nothing happened, the allegations would be found false due to a lack of proof but that doesn't mean his reputation wouldn't be ruined. His personal convictions and policy leave nothing to chance. Like others have said, there is no chance he will be accused if he is never in the situation.Which leads to another question? Why do any of us care what his personal conviction is in this? We abhor cheaters and assaulters yet chastise someone who removes any chance of an accusation because he acts in a way that you wouldn't act. His religious beliefs have a view that most men who are mature in their beliefs should be "elder qualified". Christians are supposed to be [above reproach](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-character-of-the-christian-above-reproach/). Not many get to that point but I can't knock him for trying.
1 I can just visualize the scene now:[Matt Lauer sits alone in a hotel suite, staring out the window.  His cell phone, with a new number he hasn't shared with anyone other than his lawyer & agent, starts ringing.  The display reads 000-000-0000 US GOVT.]Matt Lauer:  Hello?VP Pence:  Hi Matt, it's Mike.ML:  Mike who?  How did you get this number?VP:  It's Vice President Mike Pence.  I'm only vice president, but the guys at the NSA will still run down phone numbers for me.ML:  Oh, uh, what can I do for you Mr. Vice President?VP:  Well, two things.  First of all, don't eat room service in that hotel.  Their kitchen is gross.  Order in a pizza.ML:  Uh, thanks, I guess.VP:  The other thing -- how funny and stupid is my thing about not being in private with women other than my wife now, motherfucker?  Major dorky, right?  Still, I guess it beats the shit out of being a disgraced has-been TV personality, doesn't it?ML:  [Silence]        VP:  One last thing, consider better divorce representation.  They're setting you up for a major buttfucking.  Anyway, I gotta go.  Nice talking with you, and good luck.
1 How many people have business lunches with people of the attractive sex without worry of rumors and accusations?
1 I don’t think Pence is capable of laughter.
1 White House staffer: "Mr. Pence, the president... he... sexually harassed me."Pence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo
1 [deleted]
-20 I would suspect that this behavior stems from prior infidelity though
1 Yeah, no. Pence has behaved like this since long before this trend of sexual predators being publicly accused started.
1 [deleted]
1 Can you imagine if your professor wouldn't let you into their office without a third party present? Or a colleague who wouldn't get a business lunch with you out of fear of accusations? 
1 ... What kind of questions?  Like he is alone with a woman so who knows what will happen, maybe he'll trip, fall and land inside her? Or do you mean people will question why a person of authority would have private discussions with women?  Because that is incredibly sexist.
1 The church threw him just because of rumors without anyone having any proof?
1 I've been alone with my male therapist for an hour every Monday evening for the last four years. Nothing inappropriate has ever happened. It's almost like adults are capable of controlling their behavior or something. Imagine that. 
15 To have a conversation? Fulfill a work-related function? Be a normal functioning human? Not everything is a sexual situation. 
1 Dinner meetings are a standard in most industries where your time is valuable.
1 To enjoy their company? To discuss work? To be a normal human being?
1 Right, but we're talking about adults, not teachers and young students.  If everyone in government followed his principles, it would be impossible for women to work in government.  See how that becomes a problem? 
-18 Would that same implied intimacy apply if it was dinner alone with a man? If not that's sexist plain and simple. Edit:So apparently I need to clarify I was thinking of the context as in a professional setting. The political/corporate world a lot of business is done over a meal if you can't do that with a member of the opposite sex without a chaperone that's a real road block.
1 Or maybe he's just a decent person. Not surprised the subhuman left would demonize human decency. LOL

1 Pence isn't going to be "dining alone" with some rando. And your last sentence is pure [projection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/27/a-botched-sting-with-a-phony-roy-moore-accuser-was-supposed-to-discredit-the-media-like-similar-schemes-it-did-the-opposite/?utm_term=.56eafe30c766)
1 The issue, frankly, comes down to accusations. If a single sexual assault *accusation* would not end a political career, I could agree with you. Unfortunately, for as much good as the "believe the victim" campaign has done, it has opened up our society to the potential for false accusations to a much greater extent. People lie. People cheat. People will use advantages to get ahead or trade them for a seat at the table. Not all people, mind you, but you can't necessarily know whom. Anyone who doesn't think so is fatally naive. In business, we call this an "internal audit". You keep checks and balances. You have multiple people double check things. The guy counting the money isn't the guy depositing it. This keeps everyone honest. It isn't that people are not honest, but there is a select group of society that will steal, regardless of whether they need to, if given the chance. By setting up procedures, you combat that and prevent the potential for a moment of weakness by either party to ruin the other.
1 I really can understand that. And I think that’s a fundamentally wrong decision. 
1 You aren't wrong, however I was responding to the claim that the rule is what kept him faithful, not that it is politically expedient. 
-7 The guy is free to do whatever he wants, it just makes him look like a square bible-beating stiff, which coincidentally he is.
1 Yes, I did read it.  I do not care why he is doing it.  I do not respect his beliefs and I do not respect what he does because of those beliefs.
1 He will not go anywhere women are if alcohol is served without his wife.  They serve alcohol at restaurants. 
1 Because people like the commenter above don’t care. They put aside their reason and understanding just to get a shot at the “other side.” Left, right, people are mostly the same.
8 Yeah, reading the article that has been sweeping the internet all day and is the basis of the thread was a real chore.  
8 He lied about knowing what Flynn was up to (according to Flynn himself). He lied about Trump's tax returns. He's lied about the Clinton Foundation funds. He blamed people on healthcare waiting lists in Ohio on a medicare expansion when it was completely unrelated.
1 "No fact checking" wtf is that no Google nonsense?
0 He believes conversion therapy for LGBT+ people is effective, despite numerous times being shown the evidence that it is in fact harmful. The man regularly has put out false statements about LGBT+ people in order to win his base. This is not a man who has integrity or interested n the truth if it doesn't suit his political interests.
-1 I like how you're rock solid attempt to get someone to prove a public figure is a liar entails making sure they don't get an opportunity to fact check, or source a claim for that matter. You have devolved the conversation into a dick measuring contest about who gets to feel more right about their position and have made it perfectly clear you care very little about credible info. Noice.
1 I can think of three different people in the Trump organization *off the top of my head* who have pled guilty to crimes in the last couple of months... What are you fucking smoking?Edit: Oh no, I forgot we're in a reality where downvotes *do* erase Flynn, Papadopoulos, and Manafort!! it buuuuurns!!
82 Laws imposed by the government =\= morality.Betraying your friend is far worse than letting a few legal adults drink beer together. 
29 Not objectively immoral, but I'd personally think anyone who did that would be an asshole.
29 Ilegal sure, but don't confuse following the law with being morally right.
1 I mean...For one, as the story goes, he didn't report it. The administration came to their house and caught them, he just made the choice to rat everybody out on the spot. If this is a 'moral' act, he was only moral once he was caught. On the other hand, illegality doesn't equate to immorality. Laws are made by men and men are fallible. 
1 it is immoral.everybody should be entitled to do with their body what they want.when you rat somebody out for drugs, you’re getting them into trouble for doing something with their own bodies. how fucked up is that?
1 Betraying your brothers over something harmless isn't really moral. With your moral compass I wouldn't trust you as a friend. If I had a friend who started telling on me for harmless bullshit that hurts nobody is dump them in a heartbeat. Could you imagine having a friend who called a cop over because you J-walked?
1 Its definitely immoral. College dudes are going to drink beer. College dudes lives will become much more difficult if they get a drinking ticket/suspended/expelled. And the only lesson they will learn is that Mike Pence is a POS. I don't get what legality has to do with morality.
1 Yep cause law=morality
1 Unless you think the US drinking age is bullshit.
1 Legality and morality are two separate things. It can be immoral to support legal things and vice versa. Not to mention this was back when the drinking age was 18 so it was more likely a school policy and not illegal. 
1 Yes it is. The law does not define morality.
1 Eh, I don't know if I agree. There are definitely laws that are immoral to report the violation of. 
1 Fuck off Pence! 
1 It's massively immoral. As is forbidding people to drink until they are TWENTY-ONE. Madness.
1 Wait but youre older than 18 in college, you can drink right?
1 If they're doing so without harming you, mind your own business. Is it really that hard to understand why snitching people out is generally seen as obnoxious? Of course alcohol is harmful and binge drinking is dangerous; being concerned for someone's well-being is a very respectable thing. But if you want to change their ways, you talk to them, not the nearest authority figure who will slap them with a 30 minute conduct hearing and ultimately not change anybody's habits.
1 Most of them die from stupidity
1 And the imagery can be badass even if you are not christian. Powerwolf is not a serious band at all, nor even christian, but mixing the catholic church and werewolves works as a ridiculous yet awesome combination.
1 It's not my thing either but lots of people just like those events and it's really not a big statement or anything worth making fun of
1 Seems similar to being a loud and proud atheist commenting on everything in reddit. Why is pence better?
1 Vegetable themed WWE would be lit tho
-4 why is it admirable? you can have platonic friends of the opposite sex. To me it screams insecurity or uncomfortableness around women. Like does he not trust himself to be alone with other women? To me it seems super strange and repressed
1 Right? Like I feel like reddit should be encouraging this behavior, not denouncing it because of party lines. I feel like they rag on the "frat bro" lifestyle all the time, but there sure are a lot of people defending it year. I don't have any problems with kegs by themselves, but add in liquor, peer pressure, and no oversight and you have some problems. His base will also see this as a very positive thing, so I guess they can continue to share the story!
1 It's clear that both are irresponsible. 
1 Snitches end up being elected vice-president to a retarded cheeto.

1 The best one was when he called [this photo](https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/17638420_1485048447.6752.jpeg) of Spicer an "*angry neck with ears.*Sadly, I dont think it was included in the compilations here.
1 Yeah, Battiste could stand to cool it a little with his editorial additions. I think on the whole, though, the show is still better for him and the band being on it.
1 TBH I think JB is hilarious -- I love his editorializing
1 He is the main reason I stopped watching.
1 > tight as hell in the pocket*musician.exe encountered an unexpected error**
1 God that guy drives me nuts. You can almost hear the sheer desperation ramp up as he does progressively more wacky things hoping the camera will pan to him. Seems like a nice guy and a world class musician so I wish he would stop trying so hard in this context
1 Suicide SQUAD inducing, since he sounds like Leto's Joker
1 Yeah he could probably lay back a little more. He gets in the way sometimes with musical guests too, but hey, when you don't bring your own band, you get the house band, and JB is pretty good for the most part. The rest of his band is stupid tight anyway. He's not actually as obtrusive as Paul Shaffer was back in the day w/ Letterman now that i think about it.
1 There's five videos how tf are we supposed to know which one you're talking about.
1 We did not.
1 Which is a shame because he's super talented (musically).
1 Nah, Paul knew when to talk and shut up.
1 Yeah but Schaeffer knew he was annoying.
1 It makes me sad that The Roots are now “Fallon’s band” :(
1 They should take Fallon's show and give it to Colbert too
1 That's the Legendary Roots Crew to you, mister!
1 Best show on television right there.
1 Batiste.And yes we do.
1 Yaptiste*
1 Quiet you.
1 Thank you internet stranger!!Best of luck to you in your endeavors!
1 Haha no no I hope they give it to you, I did nothing but enjoy the show :)
1 It’s like how Mark from The Room was named after Matt Damon.
1 Mark Flynn? I barely know the guy.
1 Let's not make this a witch pursuit thingy
1 I remembered a detail wrong, read this a few hours ago. Even so, it's still an authority figure. Given: 1) the dean was coming to the door regardless of Pence's existence 2) Pence was "appointed" responsible for dealing with complications with authority figures. He stepped up and owned the groups collective actions instead of trying to weasel out. Lying would have likely only poured gas on the fire. From where I sit, in this one context, his actions were honorable. Not an endorsement of Pence the politician, but I see nothing wrong with this story. 
1 This hasn't been my experience. Even so, if someone wants to cut me off because I chose to not obstruct justice, good riddance. Although I typically wouldn't be friends with someone like that to begin with.

1 VP A Did something. It wasnt wrong, but boy it grinded my gears.VP B did something that was actually wrong, and you dont seem to have an issue with it.Seems fair to me.
1 Maybe if you weren't complaining about petty issues like Pence supporting his wife instead going against islamic rape gangs I wouldn't have to "whataboutism". The ironic thing is you probably support universal healthcare I mean stealing money against people's will to pay for medical. Maybe you don't like how Pence used money willingly given to him, maybe you'd like it more if he used the state to steal it from others instead. 
1 Do I need to break out by original reddit account? I was here long before the migration.

14 Hahahahahahahaha! I'm so fucking happy right now
86 You guys talk a lot about having freedom, but you're not free to play a poker game in your own damn house? That seems insane to me. 
12 even the states that don't allow home poker aren't going to send police officers to your house over saturday night poker with the boys.Then again, this is a college we are talking about, and they've done some crazier things.
6 And the parent comment said that they heard it from someone that went to Harvard with him
1 Interesting, so either what I was told is incorrect or the law varies by state.  
0 God I fucking hate my state
1 > I was curious about the plausibility of this story... so Ted Cruz went to Princeton (in New Jersey). The STATE OF NEW JERSEY 213th LEGISLATURE says:OP said Harvard, and he went to Harvard Law School so...
1 yup, FIJI was the music nerds at my school 
1 Sororities aren’t just kept to one university..? I thought that they were unique to the schools? And what is FIJI?(I’ve never really understood the sorority/fraternity thing, other than you have to earn your way by doing things/money and it looks good on resumes. I’m not sure if I’m even correct in that regard honestly..)
1 Mizzou? 
1 Southern Indiana?
1 Fiji was probably the biggest douche filled, rich kid, frat bro frat in existence at my school.
1 >made any guys who weren't Fijis at their house for a party uncomfortable. You mean every frat ever?
1 The Fiji house at the University of Washington is considered the 'elite' house as well.
1 You know you can't just leave a comment like that without details... 
53 The whole fraternity thing seems... really weird on this side of the pond. Like they saw the college system of Oxbridge and tried way too hard to make a lasting venerable tradition in their universities without having to go through actually having to do it for hundreds of years. It seems a bit forced.
1 If you are good at talking out your ass, you should be in a fraternity!
1 Deja vu is a strip club near where I'm at. Kind of funny if you think about it as that. 
1 Ironically, Deja Vu is a chain of trashy strip clubs in Michigan and Indiana...
1 You forgot the part of the joke where Deja Vu is a large chain of strip clubs in the U.S. It's funny putting that in a joke about Pence. 
1 >talking out of my ass.Ironically this is part of the initiation process for some frats
18 Not with that attitude they aren't.
5 *woosh*
-1 *neither...nor
1 Lol no way?
1 Yes, Deja Vu is a strip club in Southern California 
1 Thank you, it did confuse me as I know it's French but you never know what you'll yanks can mess up.
1 Optional selective social clubs, typically joined by freshman. Process for most is called pledging (think soft opening for a restaurant). Large international organizations as well ran as businesses, these clubs on the campuses themselves are highlighted with a social element, an educational standard, and competiton with the other fraternities/sororities on campus. There’s also a large focus on ‘brotherhood’ or ‘sisterhood’ which is reflected in the organizations’ secret rituals. They hold a weekly chapter ran like business meetings and have a slew of different events, fundraising, and community service presence.

1 Humans are still human. 
1 ha! very good!
1 Probably a ton of people in hollywood and politics now, have you even been paying attention the past few months?
1 Well it seems like recently every man in Hollywood has been accused of sexual misconduct. Even when there is literally no proof people still take some random woman's word seriously for some reason.
1 To be honest, I don't understand why people get so triggered about this. The guy literally wants no controversy about his faithfulness to his wife, and people are up in arms about it. Does it affect you that much?  
1 But women are bewitchers and could lie!  They could topple his ivory tower by claiming he made them look at his ivory tower.Another reason is because his circle is a bunch of chirping birds who can't not gossip that he went to dinner with a woman who is not his wife.  Perhaps it's not him, but his community that's a bunch of bitches.
1 if he was previously unfaithful in prior relationships and wants to remove himself from temptation, is that something we should condemn someone for?
1 I might have found the shittiest comment in this thread. *sigh* these people vote, guys. 
1 Yes I can imagine that, speciffically because a lot of [Proffessors do that](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1qzqk4/male_professor_interacting_with_female_undergrads/cdig3f3/) to avoid being falsely accused of sexual misconduct by a female student that they've failed or given a bad grade. I can also imagine a CEO who doesn't dine alone with female colleagues to avoid rumours that he abuses his position to date women under his employment. These are all very rational things for men in power to do to protect themselves from the very female-centric Court of Public Opinion.
1 Because everyone and their brother is being accused of sexual misconduct. If you aren't ever alone with a woman, no woman can make an accusation, 
1 You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? 
1 It's stupid. Usually it's when someone is someone's preacher or a political figure, or something along those lines. A teacher even. Back when I taught kids we had to keep the door open if it was just one kid in the room with us just in case. 
1 You’re not a public figure. Anyone running for office gets their past scrutinized (just like this post) and plenty of people come out of the woodworks to point fingers, for personal or political gain. Come on, you’re not stupid. You really can’t understand why a man with political aspirations would make a simple and convenient decision to significantly reduce the possibility of false misconduct accusations? 
1 Hey I'm not defending pence or anybody else. Usually the whole not being alone with someone of the opposite sex isn't a big deal until it's someone that is a public figure sort of person, like the guy in my example. Is it dumb that people can't just be decent all the time and that way nobody would ever be suspicious? Absolutely. Are they stupid anyway? Every day. 
9 Getting dinner with another woman could easily be misconstrued as something it isnt though. Not everyone is as charitable in their assumptions as you. See: current events
1 IMO not having secret 1 on 1 meetings is probably a good thing.
1 >If not that's sexist plain and simple.That's not how that works. 
1 Maybe if you were bisexual?
1 My wife would not be upset if I smacked my male friend on the ass. My wife would rightfully be **very** upset if I smacked my female friend on the ass. You are either being obtuse or you're jumping through an insane number of mental hoops to make this argument work (edit: work, not worse). There are plenty of valid reasons to mock or dislike Pence - the dinner thing isn't one of them, and the potential explanation put forth by /u/Redneck_jihad is not sexist. 
1 How is not being alone with women a sign of decency?
1 Yes because  prejudice against gays makes you a decent person. I’m NOT defending his “decency”...I’m just citing that in today’s world, unsubstantiated rumors go quick and can destroy a career

1 Pretty good actually. It's nice having actual standards. How is it going? trying to say being faithful to his wife is a bad thing? Go fuck a hat.
1 Not necessarily, but he certainly dines with other politicians, many of them women, and many of them democrats. And it doesn't necessarily mean that it *would* happen, just that it *could* happen. Which is why he does this. 
1 Well, I can’t change your mind on that but at least you understand why a politician would make that decision. 
1 What is wrong with being into the Bible if you don't hurt anyone? 
1 so you’re saying he shouldn’t do things because of your beliefs? bigot
1 There was a hint of sarcasm.
0 A man going down for essentially treason accused him of lying.  Not credible.Another individual's tax returns.  Not credible.Another organization's funds.  Not credible.Opinion, not statement.Nice try, you fucking sheep.
1 If youre calling someone a liar, you should be able to explain why before throwing out the accusation
1 Your*
1 You can’t seriously be defending making baseless accusations, can you?
1 Papa who?
1 but that same logic can be applied to pretty much every law you want to brakemorality is subjective the law is not, not that i personally agree with the legal age in america but the law is still the law 
1 yeah that’s why gay marriage is legal
1 > that Mike Pence is a POSwell that least we can agree on that
1 I never said that law = morality, I said that reporting illegal activity != immorality
1 Like I said in my edit, if you feel that the law should be changed, contact your representative. Breaking the law doesn't get it changed, it just gets people in trouble. I personally think the drinking age in the US is ridiculous too, and I personally broke it. However, when I was caught drinking in the dorms, I didn't argue with the consequences, because I knew I was breaking the law when I did it. Individuals don't get to pick and choose what laws they want to follow, otherwise those laws become meaningless.
1 Legal drinking age in the united states is 21*^^^(*unless ^^^stated ^^^otherwise)
1 Stupidity induced by the lowered inhibitions of alcohol.
1 stupidity induced from a drug that is dangerous and illegal to minors 
1 Once again, this isn't about what he chooses to ally with. People just think he's and not passing the "have a beer" test. Yes, other places in this thread are attacking his politics and religion.But this is a different thing. Its a little corner of internet humor, the kind where people go to a football game and hold up a sign at says "Eli Manning likes when his socks are wet" or "Tom Brady talks about 'Fight Club.'"
1 Some people know their weaknesses. I don't have close girl friends for the same reason, last time I got really close to another girl besides my wife I started seriously considering what it would be like with her. Personal choice, I'd rather not deal with that temptation
1 I personally wouldn't be too uncomfortable but it would make my wife really nervous and uncomfortable  and I respect her emotions.  Pence probably is in a similar boat. Married people can't just think about how they feel themselves.
1 With so many fraternities moving to get rid of hazing and to make their houses dry I don't know why you would join one with hazing if you didn't want to be hazed. 
1 Sure, hard ass. 
1 The creepiest part about it is that people will do everything to discredit and censor the video because of partisanship. Pretty soon they'll be carrying around signs that say "No pedo bashing"Oh wait
1 You're trying really hard, bud. 
1 hurray!
1 It's in there.
1 Same. I don't get the hate.
1 I loved the videos they did with him giving “music lessons.”
1 Yeah. His ad libs can get a little over the top, but that's part of the fun. 
1 What's it like wearing a helmet to school every day?
1 That’s funny, he’s my favorite thing about the show. To each their own.
1 It's embarrassing. He sabotages his image of what he is, a supremely talented and capable musician, to just be this cockamamie comic relief parrot.
1 The thing about Paul is that he would just murmur a comment here and there. Batiste would hoot and caw and jibber jabber.
1 he edited them in wtf. it's number 5
1 oh fuck yeah, the episode of the colbert report where he was a guest was amazing, they danced in the street. he is a true performer.just not a comedian, at all. i've had funnier farts.
1 I couldn't stand him.  His constant interrupting by repeating random words and phrases Dave had said made me want to insert a spiked ball-gag in his stupid mouth. 
1 Yet never knew when to not play. His piano additions to ZZ Top was the most cringe worthy performance I'd ever heard from him, and that's a long list. 
1 It's weird because I feel like having the bandleader mic'd up became popular because of Paul, but everyone fucking hated Paul. The main thing made him entertaining was the fact that he's basically human jukebox.I wouldn't mind Batiste so much if he wasn't just laughing and going "AAAAWWW MAN!!!!". Also, the volume on his mic is too high. 
1 I'm sad Fallon has the tonight show. He's simply not funny. 
1 Think of how many people only know of them through his show.
1 Why? I'm glad they have become more well known. 
1 I second that ^^
1 The Roots were much better when Scott Storch was on the keys!
1 Got it all backwards. Fallon is the host of the Roots' band.
1 I'm happy they're all getting a hefty and steady paycheck, which they all definitely deserve.
1 Until contract negotiations. The Roots want to go back out on tour.
1 I don’t even notice him, but I am sick of his name coming up every time Colbert is mentioned. 
1 Get a tattoo so you can remember. You don't need to remind us.
1 That was  cooold blooooded!
1 oh hai mark
1 Exactly the opposite, at least according to the article.  > During one rowdy bash, the brothers found out a dean was coming to the house and tried to hide evidence of their illicit activities, according to the article. The future vice president greeted the dean at the door and proceeded to direct him straight to the kegs, telling the official they belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, his former brother said.  This was a major departure from the fraternity’s usual practice: Whoever answered the door took the blame for the booze so the whole house wasn’t formally disciplined, according to Murphy. But after Pence allegedly snitched, the entire fraternity was handed a harsh punishment.He broke fraternity policy and blamed the frat, instead of taking the blame himself.

1 What did Joe Biden do?
1 Two wrongs don't make a right. Politics shouldn't be a team sport. Also these whataboutism answers assume that because a poster is speaking against VP A means they have no problem with VP B. It also comes across as trying to excuse VP A's behavior, which again, bringing up someone else's bad behavior really does not do. There's many, many issues with whataboutism, and the more I see it, the more I think it's toxic to our political discourse.

45 We talk a lot about freedom, but we really don't walk the walk as much as we did. The whole freedom thing isn't nearly as special about us as it use to be. Everyone has freedom now. 
13 It's a problem endemic to the US and our legal system and it's why you see some yearning for the "good ol' days" when instead of getting arrested and prosecuted for driving under the influence, they'd just take you home and talk to your parents.See, the law didn't change too much. It was illegal then, and it is illegal now (although the amount of intoxication to be "impaired" has decreased). But the law was selectively enforced. Good white kid in a small town? Ride home and a talk to your parents. Black person in the same town? Jail and prosectuion.We have so many hundreds upon hundreds of laws that apply to almost any action you can conceivably take at any point in time - you're almost certain to be breaking one of them at any given point during any day. And all that means is as long as you're a good quiet citizen, follow most of the rules most of the time, and keep your head down - you won't have any problems. But if the system wants to nail you for something, they absolutely can and will. And then it's just a matter of monetary attrition, until you can't afford an attorney anymore, you've missed too much work because of court so you lose your job, and so on and so forth until your life is completely and utterly ruined. 
18 Yea it's a load of bullshit. No gambling, no pot, no prostitutes etc. Highest incarceration rate in the world. Free, my ass.
10 We pride ourselves mostly on our freedom to strip others of their freedom.

2 Good thing I'm Canadian ;) 
1 I'm assuming the original intent of the law was to keep loan sharks at bay. Then, just kinda stuck around.
1 Yeah sucks but people abuse that and have big operations going in their houses. Especially, New Jersey
1 Most people think freedom is something they yell when they are being executed by the english.  Not an actual concept.
1 No cop has ever busted up a poker game between friends in a private residence. The wording of that statute allows that something like that would technically be possible,  but the law is used to prevent people from setting up poker lounges in their homes where the house (the homeowner) takes a cut. Can we not get dramatic here? We're perfectly free to play some poker at home with our buddies.
0 Some of us are starting to ache under the rules and regulations. Some of us want more rules and regulations. Those of us that ache are fleeing in droves. I know I'm leaving this hell hole behind, they can drown in their taxes and rules, to hell with them
4 That's very true too. I doubt anything would come from breaking that "law", unless there were other circumstances around. At worst, if someone made a stink for some reason, I bet whatever officer arrived would just say "okay guys, don't do that again *wink wink*"
4 I didn't read where it was said police were the enforcers. It could have just as easily been a campus instructor or some university higher up who sent his dogs. I imagine there are plenty of ivy league blowhards who love waving their wand in the name of their "prestige" standards. 
4 Yeah the law is more targeted at high stakes underground poker games

6 That's what I get for not reading properly... here's what that site has to say about Massachusetts:>The laws of Massachusetts are not clearly defined pertaining to social gambling situations. It is clear that a player who loses any money or thing of value may reclaim that loss, by law, within three months, but the actual legality of playing home poker games is not referenced in Massachusetts General Law.Given the vagueness of the law, I wouldn't be surprised if the school has a policy against it. I decided to check with the school, and they say something [here](https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/betting-and-gambling):> Students are advised that many gambling activities are illegal under Massachusetts law... The Cambridge License Commission dictates that under no circumstances are casino nights, Las Vegas nights, or any other type of gambling allowed in the City of Cambridge.¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
2 He attended Harvard Law School after graduating from Princeton.
1 Nah, it's not like that at every school. Frats at mine were really chill. Except for Pike. Fuck Pike.
153 Most of these groups are less about forcing traditions and more about parties and a private apartment building.Trust me.
12 It's almost entirely about partying. You'd notice in more isolated colleges, fraternities are really big cause they're the only ones that throw parties regularly.I went to a university in a city and we had like 5% of our students in greek life and no one cared about them. Cause we could throw our own apartment parties or just go to the bars/clubs once we were legal.
1 > without having to go through actually having to do it for hundreds of years.American Fraternities have been around hundreds of years...
1 Early fraternities took their inspiration from Freemason lodges and similar organizations, mostly, not British colleges. They historically functioned as dining, philanthropic, and finishing societies with a sexy dash of secrecy and weird rituals, and are still (at least ostensibly...) there to help students and alumni network/support each other.
2 The benefit is exclusive parties with sororities (read pretty women) that are financed by alumni and the fraternity itself. Typically the parties (or mixers) they have are themed. The larger the university the more wild and opulent the frats. I visited a friend at USC who had a live in private chef....
1 It’s weird even over here. I’m surrounded by different fraternities and sororities every day and I still don’t get why people pay money to join a group of friends. 
1 Your dad pays for you to live with people who's dads also want their kid to live with people who's fathers can pay. It's like classism with extra stepsThey can be more selective than the university, and your son gets a network of people like you who can give him a leg up since they know what kind of stock he comes from (because you had several extra grand just laying around to pay for a social club)
3 It is.  Now with the advent of social media and everyone having phones in their hands at all times, I think it will be increasingly difficult for Greek organizations to be able to rein in their craziness and avoid being held liable for hazing deaths.  Indiana's system is basically shut down right now for this exact reason.
1 As an american, I find it extremely weird here as well. I loved to have fun and party inbetween my studies while in college, but the culture of the fraternaties/soroties was just so off putting - obviously you cant make a blanket statement about everyone involved in that scene, but from personal experience it seemed like there was a far greater concentration of deuscey people involved with frats compared to the regular student body as a whole.
1 I’m not sure I understand> without having to go through actually having to do it for hundreds of years. It seems a bit forced.given that a lot of American fraternities have been around for almost 200 years at this point. It may not be “hundreds of years”, but it’s still long enough that I wouldn’t call it “forced.”Edit: My point is that fraternities/sororities are common and accepted parts of university life here, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen them as “forced.”
1 You wanna see weird? Come to Canada. We really don't have a fraternity culture here but there's a handful of people in every major university town/city that try to make it work and it's very odd 
1 You ever read Wooster and Jeeves by P.G. Wodehouse? Probably the most British books ever. Well, Bertie would hang out at the Drones Club, which was basically a club for rich, well-to-do men to play pattyballs all day long. If you think of it like that, it might not seem so weird to your British sensibilities.
1 Many of them have actually been around for 100+ years at this point, but you're not off base otherwise.
1 To be fair, there are some pretty venerable traditions in the US college system. Some of those universities are over 250 years old. 
1 Most of these groups are over a hundred years old. Not to mention my fraternity has several chapters in the UK. Didn’t go to college, did you?
1 Most American fraternities were founded in the mid 1800s 
1 It’s really weird. Basically paying to make friends and get invited to pretty average parties.
1 Probably due to the way you've seen it depicted in movies and TV shows. I doubt the people who founded most fraternities had any knowledge of Oxbridge's system as many were founded in the mid to late 1800's.This is just my experience at my university, I know it's different elsewhere. Each fraternity has it's own type of people it usually attracts(scholar, redneck, rich, partier, etc...) and it becomes a good place to hang out with people that you get close to, we had a house on campus so you could also live there for less than you'd pay for a dorm. You also pay dues which goes into a "social budget" to plan parties or trips for the brothers. If you choose to go into leadership, there's positions that look good on a resume as well(President, VP, or Treasurer). There's also leadership on campus for fraternity/sorority members. I went as far as to do some work with the national office of my fraternity when they were setting up new chapters in my state.In the end it turned out to be a hell of a time, have great friends that I'd have likely never met otherwise, and made a ton of great connections.
1 Fraternities have been common in the US for quite a while. It's certainly not new.[Mine was founded in 1856](http://www.sae.net/). Many of our traditions date back to those first years, and generations of influential brothers has led to quite the history.For instance, William McKinley, elected President of the United States in 1892, was a member. Our alumni list reads like a who's-who of American history. I mean, if that doesn't count as history and tradition, I don't know what does. A lot of people like to think of it as an excuse to drink, but trust me, no one in college needs help with that. It's an exclusive social club with very influential members that treat each other like brothers.
1 Mine was: 1) a bunch of girls in their sister sorority were cute so I joined the fraternity 2) rent was 330 a month at the fraternity house versus 600 minimum elsewhere. Factoring in my fraternity dues it worked out to about 410 a month AND I got free cable, free water, free electricity, free parties AND free pizza or Taco Bell everytime one of my bros got stoned... which was at least once a week

1 It’s Reddit bruh. If someone with an R next to their name donated 10 million to charity Reddit would find a way to crucify them for it. In all reality pence doesn’t even have infidelity temptations, he most likely just doesn’t feel like his wife should have any reason to be excluded when he is talking to other women yet here we are talking about how “IT MUST MEAN HE HAS CHEATED ON HER IN THE PAST”My father won’t spend time with other women without my mother around either, he never cheated on her a day in his life. Reddit just has a hard on for vilifying the absolute shit out of anyone they disagree with.
1 Well stated.
1 Roy Moore *really* shouldn't have dined with those teenage girls while he was in his thirties. There wouldn't be these crazy allegations otherwise!! 
1 I understand the reasons why, I just think it's unprofessional, and it might reduce career development opportunities for women who work around him, which isn't terribly fair to those women, who have done nothing to deserve being passed over for any opportunities that involve ever being alone in a room with the guy.
1 Okay, but what if that woman is your chief of staff? By Pence's rule he still couldn't meet with her in private.
1 No one said secret. Do you think it would be ok for that male teacher to not allow female students into office hours at all because he can't be alone in a room with a female, even in a professional setting?

How draconian would a law have to be before you are able to engage your brain and think that reporting someone for it might be immoral?

1 Conan > Fallon
1 “Jimmy Fallon? The only thing he should host is an intestinal parasite.” - Mike Stoklasa
1 He’s hilarious - just not as a talk show host. He’s one of my top 5 SNL alum for sure, but I’m always a little underwhelmed when I watch his show.
1 And now think of how many people looked up their music because of it.
1 But think about how many people looked them up and listened to their records. 
1 They're just such a great musical group and in my opinion are grossly overqualified for a late show band. That being said, they're the only reason I watch Fallon skits anymore. They make those musical skits truly entertaining because they're all just such great musicians. 
1 Oh yeah definitely. I don’t mean to sound like gatekeeping or anything, but I just think they deserve recognition of their own rather than in the context of the show. If Fallon is helping people discover their own music, then I’m all for it
1 I was the same as you until one day I noticed he is **constantly** in the background. 
1 You sure seem upset about other people being upset. Don't waste your time on this shit bud. You'll be healthier and happier because of it. Edit: I is can't do grammar 
1 alright.will you get a tattoo that tells people to stop complaining about it?
1 Wasn't this party against school policy? I'm pretty sure school policy trumps house policy, when he could potentially be expelled. Pence rose above peer pressure and put his future above his "friends" that expected him to take the fall. Good job Pence, I'm going to use this story with my kids someday. Edit: although I would ask why he was involved with such a house in the first place.

1 Hey, Nevada has all that shit figured out. Get high, go gamble, get a hooker. Perfectly legal Tuesday morning. 
1 The fact is, we can't have freedom, nor should we. If I were truly free, I should be able to ban gay people from my business. I should be able to ban black people from my business. It's my business, I own it, and I should have the right to serve who I want, if I'm truly free. By allowing someone that freedom, you're now infringing on someone else's rights though. If we left it up to business owners to refuse service to anyone for any reason, it's conceivable to end up with areas that completely refuse to serve one group of people. Is it right to have an entire town where a protected class of people are banned from shopping anywhere? I don't think so. So yeah, I do think it's restricting a business owners freedom to force them to serve certain people. I don't believe that's a negative though, I think the benefit to society is far more important than the business owners absolute freedom.

-3 A lot of them are more about forcing themselves on unwilling subjects.
1 Can confirm. I'm in a fraternity at a small school. The party scene here is great if your Greek or good friends with those in the Greek system. If your not its pretty pitiful. The shittiest Greek party ever still beats out the best apartment party. 
1 eh? My impression was it was 50% partying and 50% having a crew. Not to insult people but some people had trouble finding a place to belong on campus, or some people just wanted to join the crew with some cool people they met.That's mostly Social Frats tho. There were business frats that when I met the people it was 99% just about the network.
1 So I've learnt. I forget how old the Ivy League is to be honest.

2 Same with Ohio State's.
1 The Jeeves and Wooster style Men's clubs are very strange things even within British society, mostly because they were (are?) just for the 1%, but I get what you mean.
1 Yeah, a good chunk of our Russell group universities are Redbrick or later (only a hundred years old).
1 No, I went to University instead.           However, you got me interested in American fraternities opening up over here and had a google. I'd never come across it before but apparently there's a few small groups here and there. Even one in Brum which I've *never* heard of.

1 The insight into his personality comes from shit like the article we're "discussing" and the fact that he's a complete religious zealot
1 tell me about it. i've been arguing in /r/politics with people for hours just literally asking the same question "do you believe sending classified information to people without clearances is against the law" and they *refuse* to answer because they know if they answer yes they'll be forced to agree that a democrat broke the law. i asked one dude like 15 times and he kept telling me to take up knitting. i'm not even joking.
1 Never thought I'd see the day that the community shits on a guy who just wants to spend his alone time with a female that is his wife. 
1 You aren't wrong. Had he not had contact with them, there certainly wouldn't be any allegations. 
1 Seems like a bit of a stretch to me, but we’re not going to convince each other of anything so I guess it doesn’t really matter. 
1 There's nothing saying that pence's secretary/assistant/literally anyone else on the planet can't also be in the same room.  Pence's rule doesn't say never have dinner when women are around, and never meet with a woman.  It just says that he won't eat or meet with them alone.Unless the VPOTUS is giving out performance reviews or something, I imagine he can find someone else to sit in on the meeting.
1 You go to private dinners with your coworkers often then?
1 Because there is no one at the white house who has the clearance to be in a meeting between Pence and his CoS?  I'd be worried about what sort of secrets the gov is keeping if that's the case.
1 TIL heterosexual men are sexist because they would never put their penis in a man.
1 Explain to me how there's prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination against someone by not having a 1 on 1 meal with them. I'll wait. 
1 Well that just means you need to get your ears checked.
1 >OpinionHim having an opinion/political position you dont like doesnt make him a liaralso, stating factually incorrect information doesnt make you a liar either. You have to be intentionally trying to deceive people. IE: you have to know your statements are false
1 who is being indicted for crimes committed before he ever started working for the trump campaign. what is your point?
1 Who gets to decide which laws each person should follow and which ones are ok to ignore? What if I decided personally that rape isn't immoral and didn't report a rape that I witnessed? Individuals don't have the right to decide which laws do and do not apply, otherwise law becomes meaningless.
1 > before you are able to engage your brain and think that reporting someone for it might be immoral?why is it that internet arguments always essentially devolve into name calling? Seriously, can't someone have a different opinion than you without you immediately needing to label them as literally mentally deficient?
1 >women are people too and they are just baby makersYeah no kidding dude, and spend enough time around someone you start to develop feelings because you become invested in them as a person. Doesn't equate strictly to making babies, you can fall in love with someone based on who they are. That was the issue I faced, and it wasn't because of a deficit with my marital relationship, it was because the other woman was also an incredible person
1 Conan > FallonConan > Leno (yuck)Letterman > all
1 wow I had no idea the Roots were his band now (cant stand Fallon and never watch it). I was never a *huge* fan of the Roots (saw them once live and listen occasionally) but always had a lot of respect for them and think they are very talented... especially for modern musicians, as most music is going to crap. I think its great they are getting more publicity and have a steady paycheck... and if they like doing it great for them... just seems sad that such a talented group has to resort to being a late night talk show band..As talented as the Roots are, I think they just never had enough catchy hits to be big... they probably could have sold out and changed their style a little and sold a lot more records
1 I agree that they are vastly overqualified for a late night talk show band, but you can never have too much Roots.
1 I'm upset that you're upset at him being upset about other people being upset. I hate myself for typing that but this is Reddit and there are rules goddamnit.
1 I hate peas. They are gross and mushy. They taste like ass.
4 > Everyone has freedom now.I think that's exactly where I got that last sentence from. I didn't know it was from a show though.....Guess I'm watching that tonight. 
1 Well, from what I see on reddit, freedom certainly doesn't mean healthcare or a livable minimum wage. 
1 You, I like you already
31 It's about the wild parties and mixers with sororities. Also brushing hips with local old money and foreigners with oil money. Plus making friendships and having people to watch your back. It looks really good and can open some doors in the world. Wildly depends if it's real or if it's just paid friendships. Sometimes a mix of both.
47 Personally, the thing I loved about my fratenity was that it was a bunch of college kids with a shit ton of money from dues and actual things to spend it on. We had a social budget of something like $1,200 per week, meaning we could throw some pretty elaborate parties that we never would have been able to do otherwise. Ski trips, sorotity dinners, all that kind of stuff. Sure the fraternity wasn't absolutely necessary, people have arranged ski trips without them, but honestly even though the dues were steep I got an incredible amount out of it and college would definitely not have been as fun without it.
7 Yesterday, I was ofing some coffee, when someone came up two talk to me. "Of you seen this dog around?" he asked. "I of seen these posters everywhere. If I would of seen him, I would of contacted you." "Thank you, sir. Would it be okay if I of a coffee to?" "Defiantly. Of a seat."
5 That sounds very British
2 We've got a drinking age of 21 to thank for that.
1 It is literally just paying for friends/social circle
1 I don't know. The drinking age was 18 for most states until the 1980s. (Except for Illinois, where women could buy beer at 18 and men at 21.)
1 Two deaths nationally, and the universities are simply cracking down. Presumably at the behest of a gaggle of lawyers.https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hazing-in-america/indiana-university-fraternity-council-suspends-greek-life-events-n824561
1 Statistically speaking, fraternities are where undergraduates go to die. 
1 There have been three hazing deaths this year: [Tim Piazza](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hazing-in-america/penn-state-hazing-death-new-charges-filed-after-video-recovered-n820366), [Max Gruver](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/12/10-charged-lsu-students-hazing-death/757063001/), and [Andrew Coffee](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/pompano-beach/fl-pn-pompano-fsu-student-death-20171104-story.html).
1 It's become increasingly rare as the national offices of fraternities have come down incredibly hard on chapters even accused of hazing. Not to mention the university itself will usually levy some sort of punishment. There's still maybe one or two a year, but it's usually from someone who drank too much and did something stupid but just happens to be in a fraternity and that's why it gets reported nationally.
1 All in response to Penn States frat accident, right?
1 The guys I spent my time with at national convention were from University of Birmingham. Is there a difference between college and university in the UK? I went to University of California, but we just use the term college interchangeably. Unless you only use ‘college’ to refer to community college, then I don’t know what you’re implying. 
1 You've seen doorknobs older than the USOldest fraternities here were founded in 1776 aka the same year when the USA became a thingSo lets get off that oxbridge high horse bud
1 You expect me to take you seriously while quoting a cartoon. Interesting... 
1 Don't bother man. There is no hope there. I know there is something better you could be doing with your time. 
1 You're right, but there is no opinion/political position related to the facts at hand. There are clear causes for the situation, and factually, the thing he blamed wasn't one of them. Edit: I gave up on the "no google thing" so [here's what we're talking about](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/mike-pence/pence-falsely-ties-medicaid-expansion-disability-w/)
1 If you don't know what you're talking about, you don't have to respond you know.>[charged with lying to the FBI in a January interview about his contacts with pro-Russian advocates and with obstruction of justice](https://www.newsmax.com/politics/foreign-policy-adviser-george-papadopoulos-fbi/2017/12/04/id/829717/)
1 Fine, but you are now stepping away from the question about what is moral, and only dealing with what is legal.Like they said, reporting a runaway slave is not a moral act. Your point may be right about "who determines what is moral", but that doesn't equate to "reporting an illegal act is always morally right".
1 Look, I apologise if that sounded too hostile but it's part of the point. You seem to accept a law as worth following just because it exists. In other words you don't even question it. In other words, you don't engage your brain. So I'm asking you, how draconian would something have to be before you don't abide by it without question?
1 My last comment wasn't directed at you at all. I think its the Conservative Christian bit that adds to my assumptions to the fact he never is alone with women besides his wife. Or his beady, lifeless eyes idk. Didn't mean to offend you though
1 Where we at on Kimmel
1 They're one of the few bands still out there that have a dedicated brass section, and a dam good one at that. 
1 They're the only band he's ever had since he started his show.
1 What's your basis for comparison?I find ass delicious.
1 That's a great dramatic scene, but did you notice how he said how great America used to be? A black person probably wouldn't agree with that. Nor a Chinese person, or a gay person, or a woman. 
1 Can confirm. Many pledge brothers have hooked each other up with a connection, work together, or stay close. And yes, the parties were one of the main things. You had to be a good friend of a member to get into a party as a guy. Girls were all welcome! As a man I now realize how oppressed we were in college. 
1 Also, where I went to school, living in a fraternity was cheaper than living in one of the dorms. I also am not sure I would’ve made it past sophomore year without some of the structure the fraternity put into my early college years. And yes, there have been other older members of the fraternity who can “put you in touch with” someone they know at certain companies to give you a leg up, so to speak. 
1 So almost 20k per semester? Im sure having a lot of money at a young age is very fun but most of us college students are struggling.My experience with frats and sororities is that they are a bunch of entitled white people with rich parents that only interact with others in a frat or sorority and functions similarly to a high school.
-2 It is very british. Maybe it's to do with your drinking laws? We can just drink wherever whenever with whoever when we go to uni here.
1 True story, my girlfriend was giving a campus tour around the University of Birmingham to some Ivy League pro-consul or something and her entourage. They were aghast when they saw the student bar- "won't everyone just drink and not turn up to lectures?"       How little do they think of you over there? Jesus.
1 What about the kids who die from drinking freshman year without pledging fraternities? There is a problem with kids being killed when pledging fraternities. It's not what the organizations stand for and is not why they were founded.But to act like the problem of hazing is limited to fraternities is asinine. Hazing is a societal problem. Further, the problem of irresponsible drinking in college settings is not exclusive to greeklife. Generally speakimg, you're safer partying at fraternities than at a random house party that has no regulations.
1 And LSU, FSU, and Texas State, yes.
1 College tends to be for 16-18 years old, either 6th form colleges or colleges that do vocational qualifications. Complicating the matter are the old polytechnic colleges that people went to if they wanted to do higher learning but weren't part of the lucky 20% or so that could get to University (due to grades or money). However, they've since been given University status, though the stigma of them being "second class" institutions still remain especially among older people. This is a shame because there are some excellent Ex-Polys such as Aston or Nottingham Trent.             For the most part you can use them interchangeably and people will gloss over it. Most of my workmates from the Birmingham area said college instead of university.
1 I have indeed seen doorknobs that old.
1 You guys really don't do light teasing, do you?                       (Although for the record I never went anywhere near Oxbridge, went to Brum which is only 100 years old. And yes, you can find some doorknobs in Windsor Castle or some Tudor palaces that are older than the USA. Mind boggling, isn't it? It's amazing to think about)
1 I apologize. I mistook you for someone with a sense of humour.
1 >Pence said that Medicaid expansion in Ohio left 60,000 people waiting for the services they need.>We found no link between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. In fact, studies found that Medicaid expansion increased services for the disabled. They also found that in Ohio, over 40 percent of people on those lists said they had no immediate need for services. In short, the size of the list is not a sound measure of need.That's not lying, that's just being wrong...
1 When did I ever say you shouldn't question bad laws? my whole point that literally every replier seems to be ignoring is that the way to fix bad laws is by contacting your representative and getting the laws changed. Breaking the law and then complaining when you face the consequences of breaking that law accomplishes nothing. Period. If I encountered a law that I thought was "draconian", I would immediately get involved politically in trying to repeal that law. Because that's how the system works. There are obvious exceptions where publicly breaking the law in order to get publicity helps draw attention to a cause (see Rosa Parks), but even then the person breaking the law in protest needs to except that there will be consequences to that protest. But honestly those kinds of cases are irrelevant here, because we're not talking about a group of students protesting the drinking age, just a couple of frat bros throwing a kegger that they knew involved underaged drinking. Was Pence a bad friend for what he did? sure. Were his actions immoral? No, I don't think so. He's done plenty of shit since then to be an immoral person though.So no, I don't blindly accept laws without "engaging my brain" I just think that if you have an issue with the system, you should work to change the system, not just ignore its existence.
1 No offense taken, but I am a Christian as well and so that has molded my own views of the matter. I don't agree with Pence because he's Pence, but I agree with that choice because of my own experiences/shortcomings/beliefs. Nice talking with you, no sarcasm meant
1 Kimmel... Kimmel is good in my book. I remember him on the Man Show and it seems he's really grown as a comedian.Unnecessary Censorship and Mean Tweets are gold.
1 He's were he belongs.
1 I believe he was talking from a economical and innovation stand point. Obviously social freedoms have come a long way. But I'm a white, straight, land owning male. So pretty much any point in American history has been alright for me. 
1 There are quite a few people that pay their way through college and join fraternities and sororities. Just because you think it's a bunch of entitled rich white people is quite often not true. And the better ones do interact with people outside of greek life, a good few of my friends are outside the fraternity and I have never looked down on anyone outside of greek life. Maybe you just don't know the right people.
1 After adding all the membership dues, subtracting all the house bills and shit, what's left is used as you see fit.Having an elected position like treasurer is great for a resume if you can say "I managed $xxx,xxx per year for an organization composed of xxx people".
1 Just so it's clear, that $1,200 is a total of everyone, not a single person's money. So if they had 150 members that would be each person chipping in an average of less than $10 a week going to their socials. 
1 Dues are not $20k a semester. He said their entire fraternity of 50+ guys’ budget for socials was $1200 per week.I’m sorry you feel this way, but that’s a very narrow-minded viewpoint. The majority of my brothers get federal financial aid, coming from low-to-middle income families. We also have several POC.
1 I agree, but I think they meant the fraternity itself had a social budget of 20k per semester, after combining all of their money together. Not each person paid that much, or each person got that much.
1 I just joined one as a freshman, but everyone is middle or lower-middle class. Its just a lot of guys that like partying on the weekends. That being said, we have nowhere NEAR the amount of money OP was describing above. We barely have that for parties per semester. Everyone just throws in cash for 30 racks lol.
2 I'm not saying that's exactly why, but I think it's exactly why.
2 Deja vu.
1 It has a lot to do with drinking laws because most college students can’t legally drink until their last year or so (21 vs 18 in the Queen’s realm).  Also fraternities allow an easy way to make new friends through buying a membership and submitting themselves through a dignity-robbing process.
1 it's a lifestyle. i was never interested in fraternities and none of my friends were either. it's not something everyone does, just a select group.
1 Ya same haha. I also wasn't bashing Christians, as I was raised as one, just the Christians who are not Christ-like
1 I understand not everyone fits my description and I began the sentence with my experience as I didnt want to project my experiences onto someone Ive never met like the guy I was responding to.  But I go to a major state university and can confidently say the major frats and sororities fit my description to a teeI dont "think it" Ive seen it and lived with multiple fraternity members
1 150 members is a fuckload, what frat has that many people? 
1 I understand its spread out but at my university the dues can range from a couple hundred to 3000+ dollars a semester per person
1 I appreciate it but no need to apologize :) everyone is entitled to their own opinion
1 If you run into assholes all day maybe ur an asshole 
1 I went to a school of ~1200 students/matriculated class, it wasn't uncommon for Greek Organizations to have well over 100 members even with nearly 20 fraternities on campusI mean, I was a Charter Member of my Sorority and we started with 35 or 40 members a decade ago and they're at ~125.The M:F ratio  of the school was 75:25 when I was there, but I think it's closer to 60:40 now, which explains the surge in Sorority membership
1 I believe my chapter has about 175-180 active members with 2 years having 50+ person pledge classes. While we are considered large, usually, bigger public universities have at least a few big chapters like us to my knowledge.
1 Any large state school? SEC schools like Bama can have 5+ 150+ man chapters.
1 General breakdown of dues at my alma mater was the same range. $1800 for a room for the semester compared to the school's $4000 for a dorm or $1000 + utilities for a rental. $900 for a private chef who cooked 15 meals a week plus special requests, compared to the school's $2000 mealplan. $1000 for dues of which $400 paid insurance for the fraternity and would also cover any healthcare cost not covered by your primary health insurance.Joining a fraternity would be $2000 more expensive your first year but would be at least $3000 cheaper every year after.
1 Holy hell. I go to a school of ~34k, and I don't got to frat parties much but every one I've had experience with is like...30-50 brothers, tops. 
1 Those numbers dont really add up man.  A school of 1200 students with 20 fraternities, with many having 100+ members?
1 Honestly I think I just underestimated how many members the frats at my school have, because when I'm around not all of them are there. 
1 About half the campus was Greek, maybe a bit more.Edit: most people joined for networking or academic accountability, it was a school of over-achievers who did everything to pad their resumes, and Greek Life was a simple way to add volunteering, philanthropy, leadership, etc. Not everyone stayed super active, but still maintained membership in most cases.
1 1200/class*4.5 (rough estimate with co-ops and double-majors staying an extra year)= 5400.Roughly half of the campus went Greek for the networking opportunities and academic accountability.

581 r/memeeconomy ?I see some potential with Bernie standing next to a white board. 
94 How can you be "first and *only*" if someone later copies you and becomes "second"?
310 Funny, that's the reason my Mom voted for Trump.
569 "He copied me!!" ... lol, sounds like a five year old
94 His Lawyer wrote that one too. 
16 Wow, this tweet really blew up.
151 It's unbelievable how a party can pass such a significant bill with handwritten last minute additions. This is the fucking US SENATE, their standards are completely unacceptable. The blatant disrespect to the American people can't be tolerated anymore
373 Bernie likes to burn, I guess you could call this a Bern Notice. 
54 haha. The joke's on Bernie. This was written by Trump's gardener
141 This is something he has [actually done before.](https://i.imgur.com/Jc4bHiW.jpg) ~~Maybe even the same board.~~
30 It's too bad that Congress never gets to yell directly at the President. The House of Commons sometimes seems like a daycare, but at least the Prime Minister has to face questions from the MPs (and find ways to dodge them).

12 [Keep. Your. Word.](https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/938094660400107520)-Bernie on Twitter
6 The funny thing to think about is there must be an office within Congress where people go to get these sort of things printed. Can you imagine what they must see? "OK, so this tweet, but huge, on cardboard. Cool?"
11 Bernie is going to need a big Kinko's account if this becomes a common thing to do.
11 Bless his heart. 
18 It looks like he’s going mental from wondering if he’s the only one going mental. God bless you, Bernie. 
30 The interesting thing is that Bernie was probably seen as odd for doing this  even though all he is doing is bringing in physical proof of Trump's fuckery."*Well, yeah, I know he SAID that but you aren't supposed to REALLY acknowledge it man"*
28 God bless Bernie Sanders, that man never gives up the fight.
78 It is so 2015. Outdated. It is almost 2018 now.  So the GOP will cut away the social safety net and every fabric of our democracy.
14 Alt-tweet.
68 I just like how the Republicans are recreating the exact same conditions that ended the 1920's. What could go wrong?
31 Love how people are just deflecting and not addressing the fact that there's proof Trump is a liar and won't keep his promises. His supporters fell for his bullshit. Sad. 
4 Notice the account isn’t following him. Burn
1 That's a lot of empty seats.
1 I will ALWAYS believe that if it would've been Bernie vs. Trump, Bernie would won in a landslide. There will never be any point in time that  I do not believe that.
18 Bernie needs to visit /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump and print out a lot of his tweets. 
1 Goddamn Legend! He should be Pres right now he would have faught for net neutrality :(
10 BERNIE 2020 unless the cia gets him first

1 His lawyer wrote that./s
1 When politician lies to his constituents, that should be a felony.
21 He’s been doing this for a long time. People need visual reminders of false promises from Trump and thankfully Bernie is here to provide that.

5 Has Trump ever kept his promises....oh yeah to the 1%
1 The man the US needs, doesn't deserve, and won't vote for.
1 This is just how old people read & share tweets.
28 HE CAN STILL WIN!
1 My man is fucking savage. Keep fighting the good fight Bernie.
7 We don't deserve Bernie
8 This is why Bernie is the fucking man. He may never be our president but he'll always be remembered. 
6 This is just how he reads all tweets and emails.  
4 What I can't even understand is why this isn't becoming an everyday setup in congress.EDIT: I mean, I can't understand why this hasn't been a thing for months actually.
1 I'm English but I followed the Sanders Democratic campaign from its infancy on here, but all I can say is that it's America's fault that Trump got in as they didn't vote for this fella over Hillary. 
2 Again.  He’s done this a few times.
2 Is there a rule against using Powerpoint in congress?  Ive noticed even the younger senators use whiteboard/poster board. It seems so antiquated.   Maybe for security purposes they dont allow laptops?
2 How has no one posted this as a Photoshop contest yet?
2 Well, that pic belongs in /r/photoshopbattles that's for sure

2 About to see a spike in deleted political accounts 
1 I thought this was a meme
1 Will he have another crack in a couple of years time? Will the Dem establishment support him this time over some dodgy, loaded establishment figure?
2 I always read Trump's tweets in Stephen Colbert's voice reading Trump's tweets.
2 They have all lost their minds. 
2 I feel like someone prints all social media off for Bernie to review, as it's too confusing using 'those technologies' . 
2 God this pic looks like Lewis Black in his later years about to yell savagely at the Congress for being just stupid dumb fucks.
2 Wtf dont they have large flat screens yet instead of wasting paper on ridiculously oversized print outs
2 No one gives a fuck unfortunately. Look at the senate seats, bursting at their seams...not.
2 Love that he hasn't clicked the follow button

1 TIL Bernie doesn't follow Trump on Twitter
1 Wow, stop the presses.🙄
1 Trump lied? Nooooooooo
1 As a brand, Twitter has to be ecstatic.
1 my hero
1 Is this new? I think I’ve seen this before. 
1 As if Trump has ever had one single shred of moral integrity in his entire pathetic life. 
1 The fact that THIS is the Bernie stuff that gets the front page attention of Reddit and not MEDICARE AND COLLEGE FOR ALL is depressing.
1 The thing that gets me about this.... how is it even remotely possible that the US Congress lacks the capability of providing digital projections of some sort?Smart screens? Big LED TVs? Something?I've seen high schools with better A/V departments. Why the hell did he have to print it on a giant posterboard?
1 Someone should photoshop Trump in the other seat. Replacing the other man.
1 Le bernieeeee! :p hehehehehe XD ;) :p :D
1 The good old Bring-Your-Tweet-To-Work Day.
1  Republicans are all required to be fluent in doublespeak, so this likely won't have an effect on them. They'll pass and praise the bill and then in the same breath say they're not raising taxes on the middle class.
1 I wonder how much it cost him to have it printed that big.....
1 as a Senator Bernie knows that the President has absolutely nothing to do with drafting the tax bill, Trump did not write a single letter in that bill. 
1 Bernie appears to be dressing better these days.  Nice suit that fits properly!
16 Since this is politics in the wrong fucking sub as usual:Point out where in the tax bill that is happening and I'll cheer for you.
5 My dude.
4 I’m a conservative and never a fan of Bernie but this is fucking hilarious. 
3 There's a "he's-old-and-needs-large-print" joke somewhere in there, but god damn, I love that man too much to go through with it.
3 If a republican senator's office made this, it would have probably been a frustrating non 1:1 ratio with JPEG artifacting. 
3 President Trump ENACTS SWEEPING TRUTH REFORMS!!!No longer will truth be horded by a small pool of facts!Now, under a Trump presidency, ANYTHING IS TRUE!
3 Now that is a grade-A Bern!
3 The truth is that Bernie's staff just blows these things up for him otherwise he can't read them.
3 I always thought realDonaldTrump was a gag account..
3 BERNIE HAS ACTUAL GRIT
1 No cuts to Social Securiy or Medicare you say?https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/01/gop-eyes-post-tax-cut-changes-to-welfare-medicare-and-social-security/
1 Every American should print out Trump's tweets just like this and have their most infuriating ones stuck in their yards.
1 This should have been done in a daily basis. Fill the room, one retarded tweet at a time.
1 Now that is the look of a man who has had it up to here with the bullshit going on in his country's politics. Oh America, how could you miss this chance to elect this guy? Why did you choose a corrupt hag over him?
13 Welcome to /r/pics where politics only matter when its about painting President Trump in a negative light or praising Bernie Sanders, there is no in between. 
3 Does he not know how to retweet? Darn kids and their technology!
5 More politicians needs to do this. Seriously, if tweets are the way the WH communicate then print it and use it as evidence. 
6 Y'all are crazy if you think those programs don't need changing. Imagine a country where there are more retirees than workers, who pays for their pension? 
10 I wish somehow we could rectify this situation we as Americans are in and have Bernie as president. If there were one man truly robbed of a presidency it’s him. He gets that the little people matter, the future generations matter, and the environment matters. All presidents lie during their campaign but at least if Bernie were president he wouldn’t fuck up the US. It’s a shame we have an ass hat like trump in office...
3 Get him Bernie!!
2 It actually looks like an edited meme lol 
-6 ***HE SHOULD BE THE FUCKING PRESIDENT.***edit: and I hope you downvoters ON BOTH SIDES **enjoy** your piece of shit in the white house.
-3 This sub is almost entirely:1) anti-Trump2) weight loss photosThis sub is deader than dead.
-1 Reddit's delusional love affair with this old windbag is starting up again.Let it go, folks. For your own sanity.
4 This makes most of the world feel better. Thanks Trump, sorry for you dear Murican folks. 
2 FOLLOW BUTTON STILL NOT CLICKED. FUCK YOU TRUMP!
1 I just donated $30 match me!

2 Please don't touch social security. I'd love to continue to pay thousands towards "benefits" I'll likely never receive.

1 Old people need big font to read.
1 Trump just got Berned
1 I mean do we need any more reason to love this man? I hope he's not to old to run for president again in 2020
1 Gotta love this old man
1 Like republicans care about integrity. They clearly don't care -at all-.  
1 So Trump lied? Color me BADDDD
1 Can the Republican Party stop going full retard, or are they a group completely comprised of the retarded?
1 Dear USA,Why is this man not your president?Sincerely,The rest of the world
1 And he still couldn’t read it. 
1 Trump can pretty much do anything and his supporters will still defend him. 
3 Just think how many jobs Trump has created of people reading through all his tweets looking for material.  Make Twitter great again.
2 Welp, I guess this is going straight to the top of the front page.
2 Can have a field day with Trump tweets...it’s an archive of hypocrisy and lies.
1 Bernie is a national treasure.
2 In which one of his 7 houses did he print that giant tweet?
1 ~FYI this picture is from back in January (in case that wasn't clear based on the tweet itself).~Just kidding, apparently he did it again. The absolute madman
1 Here's to hoping Bernie will last the next 11 years for us. 3 years til Trump is out of office and then 8 years as our next president.
1 The man who shouldve been president
1 Bernie was betrayed by his own party now all shall feel his Bern. #2020 #BerniesBro
1 Bernie is the best. If Hillary and the DNC didn’t steal the primaries from him he would’ve been president easily! I’m glad that horrible witch lost in the end. Let’s make Bernie2020 a reality! We can do it!
0 We need to clone this motherfucker and make about 500 copies of him. The world, and certainly this country, need politicians like him. His is a dying breed. 
2 This happened like a year ago 
-8 I fucking love Bernie Sanders. 
1 Is this a new one? He did this in the past
1 Didn't he do that a long time ago?
1 Where is everybody?
1 Spongebob retweeted it. 
1 Self said I should write that. 
1 Is he displaying to an empty room?
1 I'm gonna argue against him having a printer that big.
1 Trump lied!!!  We got him boys!  Right?!  Right...?
1 This the same Bernie Sanders that said Hillary was "not qualified" to be President.......,....Then endorsed her for President?
1 This is gonna be a solid meme template
1 Do you think he did this at Kinkos?
1 /r/oldpeoplefacebook
1 Not all hero's wear capes
1 Why is this form of lying ( from DT) even allowed? Not even huge companies are allowed to mislead people so often and visible without getting sued or facing some form of negative reaction via a fee.People voted for this guy based on these lies, yet he can just talk out of his ass every day.But when Bill Clinton lies once infront of “people that count“ he is done?A lie is a lie

1 Why the hell are there so many empty seats?  Aren't they supposed to be working?
1 Trump: destroying his legacy one tweet at a time
1 Oh Gawsh.
1 How about Obama telling the Russian prime minister that he would have “more flexibility” after the 2012 election. All presidents say one thing and then do another. Bernie Sanders should have caught on by now if this is the first time he’s realized this.
1 I want a gigantic mega printer.

1 Oh man, the president got stumped!He really says it like it is.#MAGA
1 In the popular internet parlance of the 1990s....*PWND!*
1 Why do you guys don't have a practice of the president coming in front of Congress/Senate and answering questions, especially before major legislation(or once a year) that's coming from the WH? 
1 Someone repost this to psbattles. 
1 And clearly nobody gives a fuck about him.  Look behind him. 
1 /r/Photoshopbattles
1 There are so many to choose from I don't know how he landed on this one.
1 ***TWITTER SCREENSHOTS ARE NOT MEMES***
1 [I made this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/tNDyqQx.png) to call out the bullshit caller, but they already deleted their comments.
1 I love this. What a fucking absurd world we’re living in. 
1 Bernie, you so sassy. 
1 My favorite part is that it's only got 600 likes. 
1 Twitter screen shots are not memes!
1 r/repostr/circlejerkr/shitpost
1 This will be a meme now
1 does he not know how twitter works?
1 Is there a link to the story or just a pic?
1 I’m out of the loop here, could someone inform me on the “he is a sellout to Hillary” comments that are here. 
1 Guy on the right looks like he hates his life
1 Do senators visit Congress in the US? 
1 Sanders is still full of shit. So it evens out.
1 Waiting for the photoshop battles to do this one
1 Pick any, Bernie, all the Tweets are shenanigans in one way or another.  
1 Where are the comments at?
1 He should do this at every conference 
1 Is it really that empty there or is it just the few seats behind him? 
1 I prayed for a sign, and then Bernie walked in holding one
1 It's like some Old People of Facebook but meta
1 /r/oldpeoplefacebook
1 needs more jpeg
1 I don't understand why you my fellow Americans elected him. Even when almost all the media & celebrities were against him.*"there is no need to cry over the spilt milk"*PS I m not American i can be totally wrong. 
1 Well when you can't debate policy this is the next best thing I guess
1 The founding fathers must be turning in their graves. 
1 One thing Trump is super successful at is lying. He really makes that shit work for him.
1 I fucking love this guy
1 Legends only.
1 What a waste of tax payer dollars..
1 Hahahaha I love this man 
1 Bernie paid for that blow up with Hilary's prepaid card made specifically for him.

1 I find it really funny that if we do end up going down the route of an impeachment trial, major parts of the proceedings will include investigators pointing at blown up tweets on poster board.
1 Wasn’t this months ago?
1 Imagine if Bernie were President right now.  What a 180 degree difference it would be.  Fucking cunt Hilary and her cronies at the DNC screwed it up for us all.
1 God I love Bernie
1 This world needs more Bernie’s 
1 There is nothing I don't adore about this man.
1 I still fucking can't believe you guys let this man lose. I voted for JT and I'm as proud as ever to be a Canadian.
-36 For fucks sake the election just ended can the Bernie circlejerk please be done with???
-2 Bernie is dumb.
2 Bernie stop giving in to the troll 
1 In all fairness, it was probably Trump's attorney who tweeted it.
1 I don't even support all of Bernies views but god dammit I love him 
1 Yes, yes. Trump lied. We know.
1 Didn't this happen a while ago? Or did he do it again? 
1 Fucking Based Bernie. 
1 Bernie so edgy lol
1 This mans stay callin out bullshit. Mofos still don't listen.
1 This is amazing
1 What a baller dude, i love bernie. Relentless fighter for the people.
1 >no screenshots or pictures of screens ban embut honestly we've come full circle with the autism, that bernie brought a fucking screenshot on cardstock.i love how i side with the argument of the post, and still its construed otherwise.
1 Trying is hardest to save the elderly and the poor. Selfless.
1 Is anything in this sub not about politics?
1 I will never **not** upvote this, no matter how often it is reposted. Especially in light of the “tax reform” bill....
1 Anyone else ashamed we have a president who goes on Twitter to whine "maaaa, he cooooopied meeee!"?
1 This isn't recent or relevant. Lame. 
1 That's how Bernie reads all of his tweets. Costs a fortune in printing costs.
1 Ma man
1 I'm setting this as my wallpaper. 
1 How old is that screenshot?  His lie has almost 9K retweets and over 5K "likes" now.
1 That’s awesome 😆 
1 Bernie is the man.
1 Bernie's too good for us. We deserve Trump the hellworld that comes with him.
-3 Oh my god, does this mean Bernie still has a chance?BER-NIE! BER-NIE! BER-NIE! BER-NIE!!!!!!
-7 Bernies a fucking lunatic who should be in a retirement community 
-5 Lol you guys constantly lose and lose and lose and still don't stop. I have to give you some credit I guess. Very determined LOSERS😂😘😂😂😂
-1 Bernie!
-26 The Dems have been using the same playbook for 40 years. It’s not working anymore. If they don’t fix themselves soon the two party system we have will end up being Trump and Republicans. 
-7 Sorry to say it, but Social Security is a scam. Government should not be providing defined benefit plans. SS should be converted to defined contribution and then invested by the individual (or at least for the individual based primarily on age) with an asset allocation that is reflective of their goals and objectives instead of having everything pooled. A typical 65-year old should not have their assets invested in the same manner as a typical 25 year-old. The vast majority of companies that offer pensions have gone bankrupt due to low returns (generally because they have very conservative asset allocations) and over-promising benefits. The way SS is set up now is an absolute ponzi-scheme that is going to bankrupt this country. here is the CBO's projection for SS...it doesn't look pretty. the age to receive SS needs to be pushed up at the very least as people are living longer than ever and the starting age to receive benefits has not been raised correspondingly to keep the program solvent. SS was never meant to be used as a retirement plan. It was meant to keep the very old from going bankrupt and living in poverty, something that the program has gotten very far away from. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51047
-7 Bernie is so economically illiterate, it hurts.
1 And you all say Trump is unpresidential lol
1 The irony is that the Bernie Bots are the reason Trump won to begin with.
1 Maybe if Bernie didn't bend the knee to Hilary we wouldn't be in this mess. Nobody wanted Hilary, she didn't appeal to anyone. I'm a conservative but would've voted for Bernie in a heartbeat. He wasn't a perfect candidate but was leagues better than the racist wig or the Saudi loving old bat.
1 Haha, Bernie Sanders still pretending not to be a communist.
-20 Liberal tears are delicious 🤣
1 I'll never trust a word Bernie Sanders says ever again after he sold out to Hillary Clinton. The guy is a fraud and a grandstander. 
-8 God bless you, Bernie Sanders.And may God bless the United States of America.
-6 And? He's just jealous he's not president. Be a better politician and maybe you'd have won. 
-20 Could we keep this horseshit out of /r/pics please?
-3 Trumps tweets will continue to come back to haunt him and probably will be his final undoing.  
-2 feel the bern

0 God is he old!.....
1 Our taxes dollars hard at work.no /s.S for Sanders.
1 Sanders with the fire.
1 Doing the Lords work Bernie
1 Again? This is from 2015
1 This crazy guy is getting a lot of attention on the front page today. Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord & Savior, Seth Rich? He exposed the DNC was screwing over Bernie. He died for *her* sins. 
1 The world needs more Bernie
1 Bless you Bernie.
1 Cuts are not the same as lowered planned increases. 
-3 I suggest you login or create an account at ssa.gov to see the status of your benefits regardless of your age.  I’m a supporter of the social security but it is in dire straights unless taxes go up. Even in the website it said benefits would be 79% funded by the year 2034 meaning I’m not not getting the planned SS payments unless taxes go up. 
-58 Does this guy have a single friend in Congress? Every time I see a pic of him he’s standing there all alone. 
-1 That Bernie is just straight up Savage is nothing new
1 Ladies and gentlemen, your future President. May he save what's left of our Republic. 
1 Irrelevant senile old man stands next to even more irrelevant tweet in an empty room, to the front page. 
-14 This image was taken right before he went full nutjub and started waving his arms around and blabbering some communist shit.
-3 NOTE: Whoever made the screen grab of that tweet was not a follower of Trump's twitter account.
-3 Bernie, go away already.
1 WHO FUCKING CARES.Show us Bernie's taxes. Let's see that sweet sweet Russian money. Asshole.
-2 Does Bernie ever not look completely lost and bewildered? He has this constant look that says "Where am I? Do I have pants on?"
-2 Match me!!!!!!!!!111!!1!!!1111!!!!!
-2 This reminds me of my parents struggling to figure out how to take a screenshot on their phones 
1 Was this before or after he bought his third mansion.
1 Why does no 1 care that bernie sold out
1 Oh look, another career politician leeching off of the tax payers.
-25 Bernie is just as insane as Trump is 
1 This guy is the most spineless, sellout piece of shit politician in modern history and reddit loves the guy. I don't understand it.
1 Bernie Sanders is as big a douche as Trump. 
-104 And people think this semi-senile old fuck will be a viable candidate in 2020?
0 Bernie is slowly turning in to the tall man from phantasm. Time to unleash she spheres 
0 I'm panderin for a sanderin
0 They bring in big printouts all the time
0 American politicians love their billboards

1 What was that one google chrome extension called where Trump post fonts are changed to a kids hand writing font? This would be a good candidate. 
1 This is why I only tweet Dick pics and mean shit, it will make me president some day 
1 This wrinkled old sausage is savage AF
1 One hell of a retweet lol
1 Just imagine what could be if Sanders didn't quit and hand Trumf the election!
1 Heres how Bernie can still win. 
1 What has he done🙊
1 I love that man.
1 Awwwww, I offended uncle bernie l :(...
1 Who paid for the ink and the sign Bernie?
1 r/oldpeoplefacebook
1 Good move on Bernie's part. I don't really line up with much of his views, but he does stick his neck out for us which I do respect. 
1 Bernie's the same guy who praised Venezuela a few years ago for their socialist policies right?
1 He should print put an economics book and read it. 
1 hes a fucking demagogue, please let him have fucked u something to get impeached
1 Can't wait till they oust this Russian asset 
1 Well if they only cared :/
1 Did he do it again? Because he definitely did something like this already months ago. Is this just a repost of that?
1 Hell yes Bernie! Tell em!
1 I legit thought this was photoshopped at first. Bernie is the best. 
1 Bernie will always be [our president]https://www.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/
1 Who is this Sanders person?Maybe he should have ran for president. Then we wouldn't be in this position.Is there a website that jerks off to everything this guy says? 
1 Bernie is a lying cheat. He took my money and caved to  Hillary. I have no respect for this thing
-8 Bernie is still pathetic. But hey I’m not a socialist.
-5 He needed it big because he couldn't read it on the small phone screen.
-4 Yes, Yes. Let the pettiness flow through you. Time to play down to the rest of them. 
1 Democrat = political ten year old...
-3 “Senator Bernie Sanders” “Trump”
-2 I think making your opponent the main protagonist of your speech is a big mistake. Instead of saying what's bad about others, you better tell people what's good about yourself.
1 He should've been our president!!!
1 Give it up Bern.
1 Reminder: Bernie Sanders is a sell out hack that had no problem taking our donations and adding them to the DNC stash that Clinton had taken over.
1 And then he wanted America to become socialist because it's never been tried correctly. Who cares what Bernie the communist has to say about anything.
1 Is this the same idiot that let Hillary rob him of the primaries, then talk about her like the criminal she is.. Then endorsed her after he ended up with a new beach house? Yes that is the guy
-36 BERNIE CAN STILL WIN!11!11!edit: rEEEEEEEEEEEE

1 Bernie is such a clown,  he brings great entertainment value to politics....
1 What a bitter old fucking fart. 
-1 [deleted]
-1 That’s probably how most of our tax dollars are used, I could see sanders reading all his tweets like that
-2 r/fellowkids material if I ever saw it
-1 If all politicians had to have the same view about a certain topic forever, there would be none.
-1 Does this mean Le Bernie can still win????!!!  Omg I love him SOOOOOO much!!
-1 Yeah this dude who sold his entire base of supporters out should probably just disappear into oblivion for allowing the sham that happened in this last presidential election where he basically stole all of his money and then turned to support a rigged primary for Hillary. 
-1 I bet Bernie prints all of his own emails too
1 Bet he used tax payer money to buy that. Grand standing at its finest
1 There will be cuts to all programs.  Candidates often say one thing but after becoming president learn more and change their mind.  President Trump now realizes being the largest welfare state in the world and spending more than a trillion dollars on welfare is destructive to the American people.
1 I just donated my lunch money for the week, match me!  He can still win!
1 Meta.
1 I love Bernie, but it's becoming more evident why his campaign didn't go any further. I think he's a little bit too looney for most Democrat voters.
1 Oh Bernie selling out all your supporters for a few million bucks and a spot in pretend Clinton white house wasn't enough embarrassment now you pull silly stunts like this.  Poor poor Bernie.  
1 Why don't people commit to being bald, like if you have that little hair left just shave it and be bald it would look so much better Bernie.
1 "HE COPIED ME!!!!! WAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!" What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
1 Sanders is a loon.  He has totally lost his marbles.
1 He looks like a senile old man. 
1 i wonder if it was funded by his supporter money
1 hah, old people have no idea how the internet works
1 Nice job by Bernie for pulling a 2015 tweet, but will Bernie ever admit joining up Hillary was the biggest mistake he ever did after being against the establishment for all the debates?
1 Next level political strategy. My man Bernie knows exactly what he’s doin. 
1 Tax dollars at work folks... probably had to have someone else haul it cuz that bitch won't fit in his r8

1 Bernie sanders is a crack pot. 
1 THE JEW HAS ARRIVED
-36 Fuck Bernie, so glad he and Hillary lost.
-5 Senator Bernie Sanders apparently doesn't understand who actually passes the budget.Trump saying "there will be no cuts" is like me saying "you will not cook breakfast" - its something I really don't have any say over.
1 I would love to see some of Bernie's more insane statements printed up, blown up and shared at the top of /all/.But that won't happen around these parts. Hrmmmmm. Wonder why....
-19 I didn’t think Jitterbug flip phones had WiFi. He must have printed it from his Macintosh. 
-11 yay more empty virtue signalling from bernie!so whatever happened to all of the donations he took in?   lolI'm just pumped with the SALT exemption being removed that he will actually have to pay his fair share
-19 Up to date posts from 2015, thanks op
1 Comrade Commie Sanders says "Give today receive tomorrow".
1 What's his pint ? He lost. He's the worst candidate ever. A socialist good at speeches  who never hold a job except for public jobs paid by us the taxpayers. He's so out of this world , same as Hillary. Anybody who believes his BS go spend some time in Europe get a job see how y like it. Or better yet go to Venezuela perfect example of Glorious Socialism  .  
1 Serious question:Why are so many of you millennials obsessed with socialism? 
1 Wonder if Mister Sanders could print out a large copy of his and his wife's bank account to show how much money they stole from her now bankrupt college she was the president of. 
-2 No No No, we shilled earlier today.Come on guys!
-2 You cannot realistically balance the budget (or even come close) without putting Social Security and Medicare on the table.Unfortunately no older Republican voters will vote for a politician who promises to cut Social Security.Hence, we do not have a two party system in this country.We have one party - and the illusion of choice when we vote.
-2 Did he printed the check he sent to poor he is fighting so hard for too?
1 Just a daily reminder that , Sell out Bernie will never be President :). 
1 So? And how is this a “pic” related?? The pic is awful and offers nothing
1 This is literally already one of the top posts on ~~poli~~pics of all time. This is such a karma grab, pro-bernie **and** anti-Trump? To the top!https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5m288x/senator_bernie_sanders_printed_out_a_gigantic/And holy crap, op might as well be a bot with the amount he posts.
1 Aaaaaand there are no cuts to social security, Medicare or Medicaid in this bill.
1 WOW.so this is the "evidence" liberals are using nowadays? nicely done.
1 Mister obsolete and irrelevant? Lol

-22 [removed]
-12 Senator Free Shit attempts to make a bullshit point.
-37 The thing I don’t understand about Bernie is him being a socialist but yet he owns a 10 million dollar home.
-6 What a loser.
-5 Someone should do the same to show Bernie that socialism never works. 
-5 Looks like Bernie found his way out of the nursing home again
1 Bernie Sanders is a sellout and a socialist. 
-50 His solution? Enforce communism. Put everyone who disagree in labour camps until death. Oh, and don't forget their kids.
-18 I imagine this is how Bernie reads all tweets. Has an aide print off the previous days tweets for him to read from one of his many capitalist built mansions.
-7 Well that's a great use of taxpayer money. Thanks Bernie!
-6 Bernie has no credibility anymore. (-:
-7 this poor old dude is grasping for attention so much harder than either Hillary or Trump dang socialists
1 Sanders is a joke 
1 Funny he can find a Trump tweet to display but can't find his own taxes. 
-37 people still care what comrade bernie has to say?
-8 Bernie is so irrelevant! 
-25 Guys here's how bernie can still win! 
-8 Oh so a politician says things that aren’t true? Holy shit guys, breaking news! And like Hillary and Bernie don’t constantly Fucking lie. Way to waste tax payer money Bernie, keep making big worthless posters.
-9 Looks like Bernie needs a rest. Put him out to pasture already.
-9 I love it! Go Trump! Would love to see Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to get gutted. 
-8 how fucking retarded
-9 This dude had the DNC nomination stolen from him by Hillary and didn't make a peep about it.  He's a fucking loser

-10 Go take a nap Sanders you old Communist you
-11 Sanders is such a commie

2 This right here! Look at what /u/FattyCorpuscle tweeted! It's a cat. How does s/he have time to Tweet this, and many other pictures of cats, while _____ Bill is stalling in congress!?
1 Is your username a Faulkner reference?
1 I have not shared my Twitter account info with anyone. I just use it to follow people.
1 I think that would improve thinga a whole lot though
1 Do we have the technology to do this? To put cat videos on poster boards? I want this.
1 [looks at username]I don't think you'll ever be President Mr Christie.
0 I do!  That would be pretty cool.
1 I would, maybe a few cute animal vids would melt their frozen hearts 
1 You don't want your videos printed? That'd be awesome. Just imagine how many pages will be printed if someone ever dares to do so.
1 At least they would be more comprehensive and enjoyable.
1 The funny thing to think about is there must be an office within Congress where people go to get these sort of things printed. Can you imagine what they must see? "OK, so this tweet, but huge, on cardboard. Cool?"
1 If someone can blow up and print a GIF.......we got some bigger things to look forward to.
1 This is why I do tweet, but only dick pics, and only to Bernie Sanders.My junk's gonna look amazing on that poster board.
1 If he tweeted funny cat videos, the world would be a much better place.
1 If you don't say things and then go on to completely contradict them on a huge scale, I think you'll be fine.
1 You can't print out a video.
1 See, this is why I never post on social media. I use it strictly for communication.
1 This is the only kind of pussy grabbing that should be allowed.
1 Yes, kitty porn could get you in big trouble
1 Weird, that is _**exactly**_ my life goal
1 No worries. This is a funny cut video. Not a cat video.
1 Did you or did you not find Tiddles adorable? WELL??
1 Don't worry... I don't think anything you post [would](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQPsgqiX0AAk0a5.jpg) be [noticed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQPrP3YXkAAd-fr.jpg) in [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQPrP3nXkAAw_dU.jpg) pile of [burning](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQPrP3XX4AIqkjk.jpg:large) garbage.

1 funny cats, Tweety birds ?  Nothing new here...
1 I know a guy who’s printing giant trump tweets, spray painting his design around the outside and selling them as art.

1 You're not important enough for that to happen. 
1 Don't worry, you're not that important.
1 I heard every tweet that is tweeted is saved in the National archives. Source: my Snapple bottle cap
1 Why, are you some kind of celebrity or public person?
1 Who let the shills out?! 
1 My rule of thumb for posting anything on social media is “would I like to have it read aloud or shown in court?”
1 What a timeline tweets being used in court. We have the best president don't we folks bigly 
1 I do. If someone finds a way to print a video, the world needs to know.
1 Is your username a family guy joke? 
1  Is this you, Paul Ryan?
1 Is that Larry David impersonating Bernie Sanders?
1 I'd like to think that Bernie has a social media team or something, that told him, no don't do this.[Oh well.](https://imgur.com/Bk2o8cL)

36 I saw one yesterday that said "Gun Bless America🔫🗽🇺🇸" 
1 My favorite example of this is many years ago our village was expanding village water outside of the village limits. You'd of thought an evil root system of otherworldly spores was tunneling through the countryside. Half the town was putting up signs that said SAY NO TO WATER and the other half SAY YES TO WATER. Everyone in the town would get a nominal tax hike but only a portion would get village water. If you had the misfortune of driving through our town and it happened to be during this summer it appeared we were having some kind of existential crisis or half of the residents had rabies.Anyway, this one sign maker was selling signs to both sides. He sold hundreds and slowly increased the price claiming it was stressing his supply and he had other clients screaming for their work to be finished. I did some freelance work for him and knew he had nothing else going on, this was just him raking in cash from pissed off country folk.I'm pretty sure there was a late 90s spreadsheet just covered in ink and ejaculate somewhere in his back office. 
1 Hows business? My dads a commercial printer too. He switched over to UV about 5-6 yrs ago

1 Also work at a printing company.. was thinking the SAME thing!!
1 DUDE ME TOO (Except it's mostly promo products).There's some really funny shit out there but I just get boring stuff with  corporate logos.  Although one of our clients did an Abraham Drinkin' shirt once, I desperately wanted to keep one for myself.

1 Bring your business out here to Japan.  Admittedly I consume their media only when in a waiting room somewhere or on the train, but I found this interesting; [they use printed text](https://youtu.be/P4UxxpOz07E?t=2m51s) where back home it was super CGI graphics etc.  American TV news looks like a Transformers movie by comparison.EDIT: Better time stamp

3159 Bernie only knows how to follow one thing and that's his heart.
17 I have to assume you're joking, but he most likely did not go down to kinkos and print this out himself. I could be wrong. 
36 Heh, Bernie knew what he was doing.
5 he actually does I believe
1 Because Bernie has no staff and printed this himself.
1 Would you? Probably smells like fast food farts.
1 Lol dude, he doesn’t managed his own twitter account, he’s not tech savvy enough.
1 To be fair, would you? When every follower only serves to inflate his ego more?
992 Man I really wanted that to be true... Like an honorary title or something
124 Wow that sub is incredible
1 Make it happen and I’m sure Gold is in your future
1 Give Dad a ban hammer!
1 You rang?
1 Bernie should present his article where he believes all women fantasize about being raped up to by 3 people at once. Pretty genuine guy, right?
1 How does this shit comment get 4k upvotes? I hate all of you
1 The tweet is accurate thoug
1 I still can't believe people ignore the fact that he tweeted out in support of *American flag burning*. His base are a bunch of idiots and tools.
1 In what way did he criticize himself? point me in the direction of the cuts to entitlements.
1311 there was some report awhile back that said congress spends 75% of their time fundraising... aka on the phone talking to rich people sucking their dicks for money. campaign finance reform or this kind of shit will never EVER stop. it doesn't matter which party gets into power if they all serve the same rich donors.
31 Where the hell are they anyway? I never really thought about it but if congress is in session..... where are the members?
30 With Ajit Pai at Verizon to finalize the FCC quid pro quo, probably.
25 Drain the swamp?  Trump took care of that his first day in office... /s
2 How's that going so far?
2 They're off draining the swamp into underaged girls. 
1 Tonight is actually the monthly molestor mixer. First Tuesdays. 
1 that's the one thing trump fooled me on.. i did think he'd "drain the swamp"  
1 Or trying to strong arm bankers into giving out fraudulent loans to their wives!! Oh wait..... 
1 Trump is the swamp. But I'm not sure you, as a r/the_donald supporter understand irony.  
1 Congress is almost always empty. Even more so when he is pointing something out.There is a video of him trying to stop the Iraq War, outright describing the world as it is now, and there's maybe a dozen people listening.
1 That's just how congress works. Most people aren't around to watch fellow congresspeople make a speech. At best, they watch it on a monitor in their office. Bernie knows he'll have a small audience doing this speech because he does the exact same thing too. It's just how it works. 
1 Draining the swamp first requires the abolishing of political parties entirely and then to prohibit lobbying groups from influencing elected officials.
1 I'm 99% sure OP is wrong, Bernie would be in the senate not Congress seeing as he's a senator and all... I'm not even American and I know that
0 > looks more like he brought to an empty congress....the rest were probably out getting bribed or molesting someone: drain the swamp.Or in their offices across the street doing work.. 
-1 At this point it's a matter of Bernie getting his diatribe on Senate record. So when we go through a Second Civil War and Second Great Depression, those of us who survive will know that it was the Republicans who did it.
-2 That’s for sure true! Those are the favorite activities of liberal Democrats so there is a 100% they are doing that. You understand liberal Democrats so well!I wonder what the Republicans are doing?

1 there really isn't any potential by him just standing there. Like if he was pointing to it or raising it proudly maybe, but him just standing there wouldn't really add anything to the meme
1 Well, how can you not be the only one at the moment you're the first one to do so? He was talking about the past after all. (It's still bullshit though, since he wasn't the first)
1 Because only trump matters to trump.
1 This is the same as the whole "new and improved" marketing line.  Its just meant to sound good and not be questioned with any amount of scrutiny.

1 That doesn't make any sense, the democrats wouldn't have cut it either 
1 Your mom should stop watching Fox "news"

1 He didn't actually meeeeean what he tweeted.-SHS aka Litter Box Barbie
1 Bah-dum-psh!
50 Problem:  Congress writes the rules and laws that govern their own member's actions.
17 Our President can't remember what he said or did ten seconds ago. He can barely formulate a coherent sentence.Our science/research departments think God is responsible for gravity and everything in the universe, except the bad stuff, that's liberals fault.Our schooling departments believe in no schooling because dumb people are easier to control. They're also woefully illiterate, ironic when they're supposed to represent "education".Our economic departments believe that people should work for their own share and healthcare, but the people in government, who just sit around and sometimes look at paper/don't bother to learn how to read or write, need to be paid a king's random yearly while they do nothing, oh and they also get free healthcare.It's par for the course.
3 Republicans have no more incentive to be beholden to anyone but their wealthy donors, so they've given up even trying to prtend like they have their constituents' best interests in mind. It's just a blatant kleptocratic cash grab for their corporate masters to loot the US economy as much as possible until they inevitably lose power in a year.
6 You... you do know it still has to go back to the house, right?
3 thats what i don't understand either. I would have thought that it at least needs to be properly written into the Bill. Like added before printing, and not just handwritten scribbles that need to be barely legible. Imagine someone doing that to a contract. "Nah sorry i didn't like the salary you wrote down. so i simply added to the contract that i'm getting 7000 per month.yeah thats a totally legal practice. The senate does this as well"  This stuff about "checks and balances "that i've been constantly told when asking questions about US government practices, doesn't really seem to be working at all
1 Well, at least they passed a budget.  
1 Reminds me of when they lost their shit over Obama using binder clips for a budget proposal…
1 Considering many of them were born around 1945 I'm not too surprised.
1 I'm really starting to think the entire system is broken. Democracy cannot legitimately work in this climate. 
1 > blatant disrespect to the American people can't be tolerated anymorethousand page typed bills pulled from someone's ass the day after a national tragedy that everyone voted for without reading is fine but hand writing in the margins is where we draw the line

109 Current one has more retweets/likes. Not the same board, it's just the same tweet that aged. 
40 It is:  https://twitter.com/JacksonCDavis/status/938069485445177344  https://twitter.com/nationalparke/status/938083767712976896    edit: I inferred too much, it isn't. As u/RyanCryptic mentioned the retweets/likes are different. Sen. Sanders office staying up-to-date.
11 I mean, he got it professionally printed.  You have to get your money's worth out of an expense like that!
2 The board is actually a giant tablet whose only purpose is to provide a real-time display of that tweet. That's why the retweets/likes numbers are always up-to-date.
14 If our republic had embraced the parliamentary system it could have enabled the early removal of presidents that prove themselves to be incompetent via "no confidence" vote.  The powerful protect their power.
1 The President gives a State of the Union Address at least once every year in front of the House of Representatives. As we saw when the Congressman from South Carolina screamed "YOU LIE" at Obama, that's when people get to yell at the president. 
6 Yeah I'd like to get off 2017s wild ride

0 The Great Depressions was caused by circular debt and WW1.  Nice try though.  Ever hear about the 80s?
1 Well I bet they would like another world war. Need to feed the military industrial complex.
1 If only the government taxed us more, the Depression could've been avoided!
-16 the 1920's were ended by the condition of passing 11:59 PM DEC 31, 1929.   I'm not sure how they're recreating that.
1 Obviously they will MAGA 1929 style! 
0 Well the "cuts" are in the rate at which medicare is increasing rather than a nominal cut. As in the amount spent on medicare is increasing from the previous year, yet the rate will be slower than the Obama plan.So Trump by doing this isn't technically lying as he didn't "cut" it, he decreased the rate of expansion.
0 He doesn't believe in anything because he has zero moral core, so holding him to account for flip-flopping on issues isn't the same as it is for someone who actually has any honor on any level.  Which Trump definitely doesn't, as much as any human being in history hasn't had it.
1 Umm nope. So far what he ran for has been working out well, albeit slowly. 
1 He has accomplished most of his campaign promises. Your just mad that bernie the socialist sold out to the DNC. Even more sad!
-7 Might have something to do with the fact that in one way or another all politicians are liars.
1 So would any Democratic president.
1 Lol. Yeah, he wouldve "faught" for net neutrality. Fucking brainless bernout supporters.
1 Or unless the DNC screws themselves over again by running and poor candidate like Clinton.
0 Also you can’t be the “only one” who did something if someone copied him. So he literally sued the word only incorrectly. 
18 here's the thing though. Trump has been spewing one refutable lie after another since he started to run.  Some so seriously insane that you need to be an actual idiot to fall for it.  And it doesn't matter.  He could murder someone on live TV and while the body is still twitching say 'I didn't do it" and his base would not only believe him but start claiming anyone who doesn't represents fake news.  It's madness.
1 Along the other things, yes.
1 If you cut taxes it means the u s of a gets less money i to the empty register.. so if you have less money you need to start spending less money (or go into debt).. since the gov has less money to spend they cut funding of some programms, guess which ones. On the other aude other programms get budget increases.. usual pew pew stuff. 👍

1 Multiple republicans have stated that they intend to cut entitlements if/when the tax bill passes.

4 Entitlement reform, which really means social security, medicare, and medicaid cuts, is next on the docket and the republicans even say as much.Gotta pay for the deficit caused by the tax breaks somehow.
1 You're a T_D poster, you're not cheering for anybody except Donald. 
1 Republicans are talking about entitlement reform as a follow up step to balance the giant increase in the deficit this tax bill will create. So no, it's not in the tax bill itself, but it is relevant to bring up in discussions about the tax bill.

1 Hey buddy, we're trying to engage in a good old shameless Reddit political circlejerk in the most highly esteemed and distinguished political sub on Reddit... ya know, /r/pics... the "*place where politics comes to die*"^®. If you think your pesky facts and truths are going to interfere with us ravenously engaging in a one-sided uninformed ~~debate~~ dick-slapping session about this *beautifully* and elegantly composed photograph of a person holding a sign, then you are DEAD wrong!!! Don't you know that the only '*facts*' that are important here are the ones that already conform to my personal Reddit-approved ideology and worldview. Therefore, in the standard Reddit fashion, your non-conforming '*anti-facts*' should and will be downvoted into invisibility and irrelevance.

With ever-increasing automation, a future is quite possible where we could have fewer Americans producing than not and everyone still have the basic necessities of life - it's unprecedented in human history and is frankly a pretty exciting time to be alive. Unfortunately, our current economic system hasn't caught up with that idea yet. The reality is that increasingly, as a society, we don't *need* everyone to work, and indeed as boomers age many of them won't be able to. I don't have a solution, but 'let the old people starve' seems like it should be pretty low on the list for a nation with such abundance.
5 Apparently your solution would be to reduce the benefit at a time when more people than ever are going to be relying on it?
4 There is still time!  We just need to do some more phone banking! 
58 Blame HRC, she bought out the DNC...Here's a scary thought my gut tells me HRC STILL owns the DNC (look at who's been elected to positions in DNC recently)And she's planning on running in 2020...shudder
2 Ask Venezuela how socialism has worked out for them!
2 The guy couldn't beat Hillary.
1 But he does lie, or just doesn’t tell the whole truth. However you wanna spin it I guess.He never says anything about how much the shrinking middle class will have to fork over in taxes to support his plans... there are not enough millionaires in the country to supply even 20% of his proposed tax plans. And this if we took 100% of their income  in taxes. 
1 >robbed of a presidencyThe loser couldn't even win a primary and would have been destroyed by literally anyone in the general. 
1 Bernie is as big an ass hat as Trump but in a different way. He's tried to steal the presidency just like Trump did despite his lack of qualifications with cheap gimmicks. The difference is Trump happened to know America's plight better than Bernie did and is somehow more competent. He took advantage of this. Bernie never worked a real job in his life. Wrote strange sexually deviant essays. Exhibit A: https://www.snopes.com/bernie-sanders-essay/  Grand delusions about starting revolutions. No practical contribution to society. Incapable of reasoning without sound like a screeching broken record. No grounding in reality or data. Uncomfortable personality. Preachy charlatan.
1 > He gets that the little people matterRight, I'm sure as the caring socialist that he is, he'd be happy to let you stay in one of his three homes if ask him nicely.
-1 No thank you, I'd rather not let those with mental illnesses try to "rectify" a situation that doesn't need fixing. 
2 Totally agree with you here. I feel like if Bernie had edged out Hillary, there would be an 80% chance he'd be in office right now. Got robbed :(
-24 I would say Johnson was robbed. Media didn't even give him a chance to speak his platform. Burnie had all the air time he wanted.
-2 The man pussed out and didn’t fight for it. Also he’s a communist. That’s who you want for president?
2 Surely he'll win...oh wait. 
1 It's real. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/596338364187602944
4 I'm 24, am I too old for Bernie to adopt me? 
0 I can’t wait until Americans are ready to vote in a guy like Sanders.  It’s many years away though unfortunately. 
-7 Do you honestly think he would have beat Trump? He would have got destroyed by Turmp (let alone a real candidate). The RNC would have had a field day with every dumb thing he ever said, including all those dumb statements he said when he was mayor. They would have raised enough money to bankroll the next two elections. 
1 Nah
1 The Republicans in Congress would have cock blocked his entire agenda, just like they did with Obama.

1 I mean, what does 'anti-trump' even mean in this context? If a random person on earth said 'I won't do the shitty thing' and then did the shitty thing anyway, they deserved to be despised or at least questioned.
1 u ok hun?
9 -Looks at front page and newest posts on this sub-Are we talking about the same sub here? The things you list make up less than 1% of what's posted.
1 Almost every sub is anti trump as they should be. Why don't you just filter out every sub but your safe space the_donald 
10 I know right. Reddit loves trump way too much
1 Trump's a liar and it should be pointed out as often as necessary.
1 I've lost more years off my life listening to your delusional windbag president complain and whine about literally anything like a tiny baby. MUH WITCH HUNT, BLACK PEOPLE KNEELING, NOTHINGBURGER!
-1 Yes.
1 St. Bernard, loyal and rescue oriented.
1 Dear rest of the world,He's our president because we don't want to end up like you, especially Europe.Sincerely, The USA
1 I like Bernie, but I laughed.
1 Can you deflect a little harder?
1 https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/bernie-sanders-summer-house3 but nice try.  meanwhile i bet you take trump owning things as a sense of pride?
1 Got a source for this lie?
1 It's not the same picture. He's done this more than once. It's the same tweet as in January, but the retweets and likes have been updated, so it's not the same printout.
-2 It's from today, this is round 2.
1 The last political party that Bernie belonged to was the Liberty Union Party of Vermont 40 years ago.
4 This is from today, he did it again.
1 Nope. Today.
1  Yeah,  I'm pretty sure it was this exact tweet.   Like, from 8 months ago. 
2 Yes. So I guess this is the 2nd time. 
1 Shut up Russian
1 You are comparing being flexible with Russians to cutting social security.One is foreign relations the other is a benefit of US citizens.And to add my 2 cents, social security is a scam. But you really should compare apples to apples.
1 Yup, until we do enough to stop it.
1 People are mad that he endorsed Hillary after he lost.
1 Just remember the republicans voted to raise financial burderns on the middle and lower class, while cutting burdens from the rich.
1 All the democrats voted to keep YOUR taxes lower. This bill is actively going to hurt you, but if you were a billionaire your taxes would be lowered
8 Because that's the only thing that was in the bill, right? My taxes. Nothing else. 
1 You all wonder why trumps base is called dumbasses. But yet you all whine about how tax returns don’t matter but somehow you numb nuts know how much trump pays compared to Bernie. Why are you all so stupid that you can’t comprehend this. 
18 Do you pay the same amount as trump? No... because you’re not a billionaire and neither is Sanders. Dumb ass comparison right there. 
1 You mean that one time ten years ago, the only time anybody actually knows about because Trump refuses to show us any of his other tax returns?

1 I guess even a moron can prove that Trump is full of shit. I guess it's easy when his lies are on Twitter of all places. 
-4 You'll need a slightly better explanation for that statement to fly. 
1 Nice butthurt because you can't actually argue the point. LOSER!
1 sAndErS iS a MorOn
1 Germany and other countries have free uni and that’s why those countries over the years have been surpassing us when it comes to education. Trust me I’m fine with keeping America dumb because it gives me more job options while you numb nuts kill each other over coal. But yeah fuck any politician who actually wants to help Americans. Better just keep voting in people who screw over the dumb and poor because they are easily manipulated. 
20 Investing in our country's future through an educated workforce? Can't afford it.  Hundreds of billions of dollars for the military and huge tax breaks for corporations? Sure!
1 > who the fuck does he think is gonna pay for that shit?He actually had a detailed plan on exactly how it would be paid for, but that would require you pay attention.
14 You and everyone else that pays taxes.
1 Maybe if you managed to pass high school you would have the capacity to think about what we currently waste our money on which could shift towards free education.
15 Got im! He definitely claims to be poor.
2 What does Bernie's number of houses have anything to do with Trump's campaign lies again? Can you stay on topic or is that too difficult?
1 #whataboutism
-3 I'm not sure what point you are trying to make.  This seems completely off topic.
-2 What does this have to do with anything?
1 I bet he's not as fun at family gatherings as you're picturing. I imagine that he spends a lot of time shaking his fist.
-1 Same :(
1 And again today.
8 > the election just endeddo you know what year it is?
35 Wtf are you talking about? This has nothing to do with the election. Politics is not only about the presidential election. There is a lot more than just that
1 > just endedUh, like over a year ago now. 
1 lol ya
1 edgy
1 Again.
1 This isn't a repost, it happened again today.
1 why
1 Says the guy who posted to r/cuteguybutts, r/conspiracylives, and r/PuzzleAndDragons...yeah dude, you're a winner alright...
9 Wait, they've been printing out hypocritical tweets and showing them on the floor of congress for 40 years?I think you're in the wrong thread
1 IGNORE THE TWEET! DEMOCRATS FAULT. IGNORE THE TWEET. DEMOCRATS FAULT. REEEEEEE... ^ you
1 You could say that about the fiscal conservatives too.  Used to be fiscal conservatives and social conservatives in the GOP.  Now its just Trump and social conservatives, both who claim to be fiscal conservatives but meanwhile the fiscal conservatives are almost entirely gone
1 The point here, though, is that Donald Trump is a liar.  
1 you created this account 5 days ago.  nice try troll...
1 and do you have a economics degree? also... do you understand that his ideas are not new? They exist in Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, ETC. and are those countries bankrupt?... no...
1 Gotta have someone type a dumbass tweet to hold up a dumbass tweet.
1 He’s not.
1 Please don’t blame Bernie supporters for the tens of millions of people that thought Trump was going to do anything positive for this country and voted for him.
1 > Nobody wanted Hilary16.9 million people did want Hillary over him. HTH.
1 Jesus, do you think he *wanted* to? His hand was forced. It was pretty humiliating for him at the time.
1 Shouldn’t you be “saving your porn collection” based on your prior posts?  How’s that republicans controlled FCC working for you?
8 > voting for a pathological liar to own the libs
1 Inside the mind of a 12 year old.
1 So just to be clear youre saying he would have won if he lied more?
6 The first post should be from a bot giving you instructions how to filter US politics out of your feed.
2 Read the first post you lazy sod. 
-8 It has historically[ lots of support](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5m288x/senator_bernie_sanders_printed_out_a_gigantic/).
1 proof?
1 Yes, this was from today.
4 Congratulations, you're new retirement age is now 105 1/2 years.  Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
6 Social security are not taxes.  It's a completely different fund with completely different rules about what that money can and cannot be used for.  Important rules.  The best rules.  Rules that are broken on a daily basis, but rules nevertheless.
1 I think the obvious plan eventually would be to lift the cap.
-3 As someone who tried his best to opt out of SS, burn baby burn. I get giddy thinking of it collapsing in the 2030s. Almost as giddy as the impending collapse of the bond market that will take half the public pension funds with it. Yes, burn, burn it all down bitch. 
55 Sounds like he must be doing something right
13 He is an independent so that might have something to do with it. 
29 No, he's an independent and genuinely for the people. He's alone in a pit of vipers.
9 Implying other congressmen/women ever show up
9 That's alright. He's got a good percentage of the citizens...
1 LOL
-1 He's the most popular politician in the country.
1 May we all.
1 Uh, no. He will never be the President.
1 You are either confused on the meaning of irrelevant or are unaware of current events.
1 brand new account, all right wing nonsense...we have a troll folks
-2 What a rare photo
5 Is that significant?
5 Lol. But really...he is probably exhausted from calling Republicans on their bullshit.
1 It's the "is this real life? Did he actually do that? He said that!?"
1 Because we’re talking about reality and not memes traded between folks who don’t know what they’re talking about 
-9 Socialists are a special kind of insane
1 That's possibly the most absurd statement I've heard in my life, and I'm over 40 years old.
1 Hate them both. Still strongly disagree.
38 I can think of even less viable candidates who have made it.
24 Democrats: I want a perfect candidate, and there are none :(Republicans: I wanna win, and will vote for literal shit >:)
19 Even if he is semi-senile, that's still less senile than the current president.
13 He was senile and old when he won the presidency *last* year.  Trump voters don't seem to care.
6 Yeah if you're looking for neurological issues, try:> Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you're a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.
0 He's only 5 years older than Trump...
1 Yup, again.
1 That may be true.But what about the Tweet? And what Trump said he was going to do, in comparison to what he is doing?
1 Sanders is a decent, honorable person who fulfilled his role as a patsy for the Democratic nomination to the best of his abilities....maybe even too well considering his competition.  But America isn't going to be electing any self-proclaimed socialists anytime in the foreseeable future.
1 It's almost like he understands politics better than you and decided that since he had no chance of winning (for whatever reason), he'd throw his vote behind Hilary instead of Trump. Because that's what politicians do.
4 You are still pathetic. But hey I'm not an idiot 
5 Are you saying Bernie is pettier than Trump?
1 Better than Trump supporters, who are political two year olds.At least ten year olds know how to share.
1 I believe this is from a senate address back in January in which Sanders is pointing out disparities in the ACA repeal proposal compared to the prior "advertised intent."  Also, I believe you mean "antagonist."  You can watch the video record [here](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4642109/bernie-sanders-reads-trumps-giant-tweet-funding-social-security-medicare-medicaid&start=0).
1 He would be if he should have. 
1 Maybe he should've won the primaries.
-26 No. Love the guy but he does not fly in Midwest trust me.
0 RENT FREE
1 >Bet he used tax payer money to buy that. Well, yeah, he *works* for tax payers...are you fucking retarded? 
1 None of those are welfare.
1 Social security and medicade are not "communist" nor are they handouts, you pay into them, you are entitled to them.  Alternatively, if you did not pay into them, you aren't entitled to a penny from those programs. (At least that was how they were originally set up.)
1 I think loony is a good thing, he's using their own words against them in a creative way.
1 Shut up russian, I can smell you from your decrepit farm
1 was he supposed to run 3rd party? it's not like he'd endorse Trump and it's not like he hasn't endorsed establishment candidates before.
1 Hahahaha - clueless.
1 This format has potential. 
1 Why?
5 except he can veto the tax bill... or any bill... which is precisely what bernie wants him to do, keep his promise to the American people and veto any tax bill that cuts those programs
2 the RNC gives the President the power to appoint and fire their Chairman if they belong to the party. If Trump really cared, he would not only criticize all of those wanting to cut Medicare + Medicaid or SS, but would appoint someone who would cut all funding to anyone in Congress that cuts funding to them during elections 
1 because they dont exist?
1 Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because he's intelligent, compassionate, reasoned, and logical.  That's why.  And to top it off, he's a genuinely nice guy who cares about our country.  And he doesn't tweet ridiculous, bizarre things at 5AM.
1 How about how women fantasize about being raped by three men.  Bernie Sanders rape erotica...ugh 
10 Happened just a[ few hours ago](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-to-trump-keep-your-promises-to-protect-social-security-and-medicare): Bernie on the Senate floor: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SMUFOhj596-gfjsNIQdDW2aWVkWn58eN/view
1 Typical idiot republican, when they receive handouts, it's ok, but saving up for the future, OMG ZE COMRADE STALIN!
1 To be honest, there is no reason social security should be having problems, it was designed to be self sufficient from the beginning... Basically you could only take out as much as you put in.  Politicians started turning it into a general fund for everything from disabilities, to assistance for individuals that have never contributed.Social security it's not a hand out, it is a savings fund.
1 You mean he's stating the key tenet for social security?
1 he should of got a loan of a million like trump from his already rich father and started his own business. 
1 We've been socialist since we created tribes.Will will naturally move beyond every man for himself. 
1 On paper it’s the best system. 
3 Bullshit, cutting defense spending would instantly solve this problem
1 Well it helps if you stop cutting revenue and keep in saying “see, we need to cut it!”. One party has a solution for that. 
1 Fuck that, there's two parties and they're vastly different. Quit peddling bullshit
1 Funny you should say that... Considering these are primarily middle class working family programs that you pay for.
1 Sure.....stay in Russia and work for peas
1 This is Bernie doing it again. Apparently we didn't do enough last time to stop it. 
1 Yeah why won't they stop using President Fat Ass's own words against him? 
1 In fairness, most Americans would prefer that the position of the White House was available outside of social media, and articulated coherently in more than 144 characters.  You can't complain about the court of social media when the President is a loud proponent of it (though clearly only when he is the court)
3 No. Don't give him the benefit of a legitimate disease. Trump is just an idiot, to put it lightly.
1 Why are you downvoting me instead of responding?...I haven't heard anything at all about supposed changes to entitlements
1 We haven't done enough yet.
19 Are you kidding? All of the secret service payments and family travel and golfing expenses but you are worried about a one time cost of printing out a tweet? 
5 like $12?
2 Doesn't change the fact at all that Trump lied through his teeth.
-2 What do you recommend instead?
10 [removed]
5 [removed]
4 So you're saying there won't be any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security under 45?
21 That's because you're a moron... Or a troll.

0 Yes, he does. 2020 is his.
4 Just a little piece of advice: don't call everyone "comrade". They're not supposed to know you're Russian.
6 You guys know how to get hung up pretty well.
5 This is about the tax plan.
3 He's still a Senator, discussing the tax plan on the Senate floor, you goober.He's literally doing his job.
4 Do you root for the bad guys in movies? 
2 Seems like a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation. Risk future funding/political prospects by calling it out, with no real ability for justice. Or retreat and continue with your platform, while being called a loser. Rough. 
2 Like most Trumptards, you know absolutely nothing about political science. 
4 You mean like the communists who helped elect your president?
1 Huh, looking closely, I don't see any tears in his eyes or running down his cheeks. Weird.
5 Tfw you lost, but are still a senator and have to represent the interests of a large group of people that make up your constituency.
2 We got a real political expert over here!

"Everyone must stand by every thing they've ever said at any point of their lives no matter how dumb it might appear, unless I agree with them politically" - the voting publicIt's important to remember, in these divisive times.

12 They're owned by FedEx now. 
22 Well...it is. It's just called FedEx Office now.
23 I.... don't think so. Maybe?I work at a small family owned print company. Owners are super republican and also super suck. What a combination, right?
1 They have to be, where else would Stelio Kontos work?
4 > Is.. Kinko's still a thing?Kinkos was bought by FedEx years ago but a lot of the FedEx stores still have the Kinkos printing. 
1 I work at a retail chain that also does photo and poster printing, etc. Whenever people try and do things we can't do, I tell them to go to Kinko's.Boy, I sure hope haven't been straight up lying to people, because I don't even know if there's one in this city.
1 Now called FedEx Office
1 I love Kinkos! Printing portfolios for school at 4am there is a warped fond memory

1 Go to a fedex store or anywhere else that sells plotter prints. Save what you want on a thumb drive and bring it in and they'll print you up a 36"×48". Or if you know anyone in the construction/architectural  business, they also probably have a plotter printer at work.

1 I guess he had a big place in his heart for his $575,000 vacation home.
1 He also likes to follow Hillary for his own demise. 
1 Bernie also knows how to follow his campaign bus in a $150,000 Audi sports car.
1 That, but also his corrupt wife.
1 He also knows how to follow orders from Hilary
1 And by doing that he cost Hillary the election. he was working with the russians by talking about moving to a hypothetical different system that will NEVER happen. he and Jill Stein are culpable for Trump's presidency. he should've ran as a third party.
-19 More like communism.
1 And Crooked Hillary...
1 He did. I asked him. 
1 ya he dose
1 I thought that first, too. But following him has the advantage that you see every stupid tweet as soon as possible.Also, I'm not sure if he can comprehend numbers over 100 anyway.
1026 Kind of like how [Snoop](https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King) is a moderator of /r/trees
1 Doesn't Bernie have a Reddit account? They could definitely make him a moderator.
1 We sent John Cena a request to become a mod on r/squaredcircle 
85 There is literally a tweet for everything. 
59 It's incredibly depressing.  Hypocrisy on full blast; not a word from anyone on the Right about that completely undercuts any defense of him.  
13 Probably one of my favorite subs.
1 oh look, I got downvoted with no response by people who have no idea what they're talking about.
485 Mandate publicly funded campaigns people.  Stop this external money source from weighing on the character of our Representatives.
63 I dont think this gets enough attention. Their full time job is begging for money everything else is secondary.
16 i think they spend even more time than that. There was a story done by NPR via This American Life that covers just that, and how deep it goes. https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office
5  which leads to all the Tweedism
3 How do you suck a dick through the phone?
2 I think it was Last Week Tonight. There's an episode on [Congressional Fundraising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylomy1Aw9Hk). Haven't watched it recently, but I think that was the one.
1 "on the phone" lol no thats too easy. they are using our tax dollars to physically transport themselves to where ever the rich donors.
1 I binge watched 5 seasons of house of cards recently and about halfway through the 4th season it dawned on me that 95% of Frank and Claire's time was spent just trying to get more power and support instead of... actually governing. I wonder how true this is of real US politics? I've read that real staffers have said the show is a pretty good representation of the truth besides all the silly murder and conspiracy stuff. 
1 > rich people sucking their dicks for money.Hmm no wonder Monica Lewinsky did what she did but it doesn't work in reverse. 
1 Or you know, like people could vote based on policy or voting records and not based on TV ads etc.But I guess it's too much to expect from people.
1 I saw they do 700+ fundraisers/year ,basically near 2/day and on top of that spend hours dialing for dollars
1 Unfortunately this shit has to stop before we can get people elected who would support campaign finance reform. Not looking too promising. 
1 The current Senate will never allow reform.
1 Take a look at the Green Party, the only party that doesn't accept bribes - I mean "Corporate donations". 
1 That’s why we need federal financing of ALL federal elections.  And a law prohibiting bribes.
1 Which is *precisely* why we should have elected Bernie. Say what you will about the rest of his policies, the **one thing** this country needs above all else is election and campaign finance reform. The man built his platform on that and the masses still fell for the same old shit. Now Trump is handing out favors to corporations on a scale we've not seen in our lifetimes. I will never understand how that wasn't enough for people. I had so many republican/right leaning folks in my life say they supported him because of his commitment to getting money out of politics. The "match my contribution" memes are trite and out of touch; at least the man ran an honest campaign and proved that a candidate by the people can make it far without Wall Street's help. Trump is beholden to special interests, Clinton was beholden to special interests, Bernie wasn't. End of discussion. 
1 Apparently it really fucking sucks Sitting in a call center calling people all day isn't my idea of being a congressman
1 If I could suck dick through the phone, being a wife would be so much easier. Work from home mom would be very appealing. 
1 I thought it was 50%
1 Usually they're different rich donors.
0 Sorry, I'm coming in to completely edit my comment. I had made a joke.I'm totally not hostile in asking this, but what type of campaign finance would you like to see?  Individual donations are capped.  Soft money has exploded through Super PACs thanks to Citizen's United.The Supreme Court has now decreed that money = speech.Most of the effective types of campaign finance "violate the first amendment" to conservative justices.  I don't know what we can do without an amendment.  I don't know if it's something as simple as a corporate personhood amendment, or if it needs to specifically target campaign donations, or what.
1 Actually this was *caused* by campaign finance reform. Individual donations are restricted to $2,700. When the average senate campaign costs $1,000,000 that means our representatives are making a ton of phone calls.
33 Unless there's something that looks good on camera, or a big vote coming up, while Congress is in "session", it's not uncommon for Senators and Representatives to give speeches and such to an almost empty room.  They could also be in various committee meetings, or lunch, or so on.  The population of the chamber proper varies wildly throughout the day.  Once Roll Call happens, there's no rule that says they have to stick around.  In fact, for politically dangerous votes, many people will intentionally leave the room so they don't have to vote for/against/abstain something, and can instead be recorded as "absent".  
18 why the hell do they get a "summer recess"?.....because they got one from kindergarden to college,,,,,fucking losers.
3 They aren't in the chamber unless there's a vote happening soon. Floor speeches like this are done for the cameras. The members are probably in their offices working, meeting with each other, etc. Whatever the day to day work of a member of Congress entails.
1 >Where the hell are they anyway?  I never really thought about it but if congress is in session..... where are the members?Did you think they were always on the floor listening to others speak? They don't need to be there live to know what they are saying, and they would probably get nothing done if they did. Chances are they are probably in their offices doing their job. 
1  In their offices. Congresspeople basically only show up to chambers to make statements for the public record or to vote. 
1 Definitely watch Mr Smith Goes to Washington! It's fictional but a damn good representation 
1 Working (which generally means fundraising) in their offices. 
1 Congress is only in full session during a vote.  Usually they are in individual committee meetings or private meetings with Donors.  These sessions in front of the parliamentarian are just for show to the public. Sometimes a few senators stay to have a debate,  but that's not common anymore. 
1 They likely all left once they heard the socialist mascot was coming
1 Well wouldn't you skip out of work all the time if your bosses were too lazy to do anything about it?
13 I mean a swamp is better than the sewer we now have. He drained the swamp only to fill it with raw sewage. 
1 I mean to be fair, it's a lot easier to find the most dangerous creatures in a swamp if you drain it. Beats the hell out of snorkeling for weeks to find them and offer them jobs.
1 ... by flushing his own shit into the system to displace it
1 you know, I never thought of that...I mean, I've only been here for 54 years, why didnt I think of that?  So actually, this is the way congress doesnt work, but thank's for the invaluable civics lesson, youngster.
1 Probably off molesting young girls and pageant contestants and being protected by their moronic supporters who think sexual assault is a partisan issue.  Rape is rape regardless of whether a Democrat does it or a Republican does it - I'm sure your idea of rape is limited to liberals and brown people.  
1 they are doing the same shit i'm sure.....
1 Walking to work is great, best way to start the day, if I could walk the whole way I would but I do the final leg instead of switching trains for a stop. It's nice.
1 Anyone doubt Bernie was the healthiest of the three Hillary , Trump ,and Sanders ? 2016 race.. I mean the man was seen running to catch a train for Christ sake while Hillary was passing out in 70* heat and Trump with his 2 big Macs 2 filet of fish power meals . Want a president for longevity get the guy that's been complaining about the same things for 4o years and has the balls to walk to work everyday

5 I wonder how much they can cut Medicare before they kill off all their voters. 
3 We have, and they aren't listening. In fact, they have found a very valuable tool which is to play us vs them (Democrats vs. Republicans) to distract us. They have all gotten very fat on rich, thick donor money and know the youth of this country have become self absorbed and complacent. They have put us on a very dark road and I'm afraid the only way off it is violence. A couple of hundred protestors standing in a designated protest zone in Washington isn't going to do JACK SHIT to change anything. We need to force our way into congress and the senate and make our voices heard but that isn't going to happen when John Doe is creating Bobby B meme's and Jane Doe is checking out Tinder for Mr. Beat Herpes.

-2 What about the people who dislike social security?
-1 As one of "those fuckers" apparently, please, explain to me why I support the slashing of social security, medicare, and medicaid (I do, strongly) and how that will enrich me personally (ie satisfy my "insatiable greed")?I am not in government.I hold no medical stocks, investments (unless they're buried somewhere in the paltry aggregation of my 401k).I simply believe that things have costs, like medical procedures.  Those costs need to be paid for by someone, and insisting at the point of a gun (ie taxing authority of the government) that everyone pay a share is ridiculous.
-1 Please explain how letting people keep more of the money they earn is a sign of greed and "taking more and more." Seems to me to be the opposite.In fact, I think that feeling entitled to someone else's labor is greedy. Why should you deserve money someone else earned?
-3 Ironically Bernie is the one wanting to take more and more from the people.
-14 You forget your benefits are taken from someone else. 
-1 take more from the people by cutting the money they take from the people... Or do you mean reduce what the people take from government?
-16 They plan to give a lot to the people via tax reform. Social security is massive and bloated, as a lot of government programs are. We need lots of cuts. This country has to stop running a deficit every single year.

It's what politicians do.

1 what developments?
0 r/Trumpgret
-2 /r/trumpgret
-1 seeing as there's no proposed cuts to social security (that burden is really not big compared to the ballooning medicaid/medicare costs) and the icnreased deficit spending was pased under budget rules, IE they can keep spending at current levels even with the lost tax collections from the tax cuts, I'd assume the posters mom is just waiting to see what the end tax result is and if she will save money or not.

2 No, thinking that he wouldn't touch Social Securiry.
2 She's not on twitter, just watched Fox News. At the time they were spinning that Hilary and Bernie were going to slash social security and that Trump would protect it.
156 Because unfortunately this is a country where if someone makes an argument and your rebuttal is simply "WRONG", they think it's great.  If you say you're going to do "big things" and make "great deals" but never couple those phrases with facts or plans of action, people are already sold and will vote for you.  I get really tired of people citing the movie Idiocracy, but here we are.
1 it boggles the mind that people even take the man seriously. he's so transparently dishonest. the fact that he was elected president is bind moggling times a bazillion. 
1 Maybe he's speaking to the inner child of his voters, who want themselves to be better than everyone at everything. 
1 Or openly begging for praise 
1 It's called narcissism.
1 For most people, it probably makes him easier to relate to.It's easy to get behind someone who makes us think they've been treated unfairly, and most have been in a position where someone else copies you and gets credit for it.Childish? Absolutely. Surprising it works? Not at all.
1 Because those people ALSO talk like that. It sounds completely valid to them. His childish, simplistic way of speaking is right at home to them. 
1 It makes me hopeless like I've never been.Every tweet I read sounds like a 9 year old seeking for attention or being mean.Even if he really were a 9 yo he will still be a 9 yo cunt.

1 This...this comment is the sad, but honest truth. 😑
15 Yes, still shouldn't have gotten this far though 
1 The house will pass Toilet paper with shit smeared on it as long as there's money behind it. House is where standards and morality are out of the window and laws are up for sale for the highest bidder.  Senate is supposed to be the place where outlandish laws get tempered by reality. So if Senate can pass this trash, house will have absolutely no problem with it.
1 The House already passed an equally shitty version (the one that removes graduate tuition tax waivers). That change alone [would add ~$2000-3000](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/7/16612288/gop-tax-bill-graduate-students) in taxes each year for every graduate student in the US ([461,000 new students each year](http://cgsnet.org/us-graduate-schools-report-slight-growth-new-students-fall-2012)). The House already approved that change. The only question is *when* they pass a final tax bill, which of the many shitty changes are in it.
1 Has to go back to the House and Senate, if they collaborate/compromise/make any changes. Still, pretty shitty that literally only republican representatives voted for either bill.
1 You could, if both parties agree.  Red-lining and updates are acceptable so long as they're agreed to.
1 It's the content that's typed and hand written in the margins that's disrespectful. 
65 > My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until..."We got a Burn Notice on you. You're blacklisted." (Whistles) When you're burned you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in: "Where am I?"..."Miami". You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you. (Laughs) A trigger happy ex-girlfriend: "Should we shoot them?" An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI: "You know spies; bunch of bitchy little girls." Family too: "Hey is that your mom again?" If you're desperate. "Someone needs your help Michael." And a down and out spy you met along the way: "That's how we do it, people". Bottom line: as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.FTFY

3 What about 2005?
1 The ideologies of the parties have switched since then.
10 I don't think that's what they're saying. They said Republicans are creating the same conditions that lead to the market crash.
23 I think what u/WinterMute is saying is that they are recreating the economic conditions that preceded the Great Depression, which pretty much began with the stock market crash of 1929.
-3 Changing their computer calendars to 1929. At the drop of the ball on new years, the clocks will say it's 1930, and they'll have successfully recreated the end of the 1920s
1 So what you're saying is he's cutting medicare. Because that's what 'cut' means: to reduce funding.
1 Not true, not to the same extent, and it really shouldn't matter, only more of a reason to actually "drain the swamp."
1 Because one spelling error means that a person is brainless.

29 There is not even a one percent chance she could win against anybody now that she has lost to Trump.
11 This last election is the reason I hate the 2 party system. Like I get there is a chance we “could” elect a third party president but in all honesty if a political party isn’t well established they stand no chance. Between Trump and HRC I feel like there was no really good option for us to pick. I also hate that many people only vote with their party and I don’t get why... why can’t people have some sort of reason and vote with the candidate that has their best interests in mind (within each party and in the general election). In theory we should get the best individual from the respective party but when money is thrown around the parties always pick someone shitty and has some sort of leverage.I’m really starting to wish the US would eliminate the executive branch and go with 3 equally powerful houses or committees so one person can’t fuck so many things up. I’m a young guy and I haven’t been around too long so I might not understand everything. Hell I’ve only able to vote for only 4 years and honestly I left the president part of my ballot blank because I was so fucking scared of what Both candidates could do. I didn’t know who to choose... a man who is obviously so self absorbed that he has to tweet every second of the day or a women who has made so many back door deals that she probably would bring more (and just as corrupt) individuals into power. I want an election that is doesn’t rely on manipulation and actually showcases candidates with morals. 
11 Blame the DNC for being bought out.
3 Blame Bernie for ignoring the South and letting her run up a massive delegate lead.
1 >And she's planning on running in 2020...It's gonna be her or Hillary 2.0 (Kamala Harris)As a Trump supporter, this would be a dream come true and a slam dunk for Trump in 2020.&nbsp;Please, run again, Hilldawg.
1 Please tell me that’s not true! I can’t do this again. I honestly don’t think I can mentally handle another Trump/Clinton election.
-8 Party A: Sixteen candidates, chose a game show hostParty B: Most qualified candidate ever, who deleted emails and was not warm and cuddly. PARTY B IS TO BLAME!!!!
-1 No, she isn’t planning on running. And your gut is nonsense. 
1 Friendly reminder what Bernie wants for America!https://imgur.com/niybcMi.jpg
1 Neither could trump. 
13 What's an Aleppo? 
27 [What is Aleppo??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOT_BoGpCn4)Media gave him a few chances, and he only proved he was a buffoon.  I'm all for a credible third-party candidate, but Johnson was nothing more then a dumber and less charismatic version of Biden.
2 I wouldn't say he had all the air time but the air time he did have was largely used by the media to discredit him in one way or another, but you're definitely right about Johnson as well. It's just sad that the media has so much power (on both sides) to sway how candidates look to the public. 
0 Johnson was mercykilled are you serious right now 
0 I love Gary Johnson and voted for him against Obama. He shot himself in the foot. I couldn't bring myself to vote for him, despite hating Clinton and despising Trump.
0 Gary Johnson was pants-on-head retarded this past election cycle. He had a legitimate chance of getting 10% of the vote, which would inevitably help the Libertarian Party in 2020, but he just had blunder after blunder. He didn't deserve the time he got, even.
1 then you could say the same about every 3rd party candidate. Gary johnson didn't get air time because he's irrelevant.
1 >Burnie had all the air time he wanted.Nothing says ‘I have a point’ like misspelling the person’s name you’re talking about.  In fact, both of their airtime was dwarfed compared to Trump’s.  Understandable in Johnson’s case - as he’s kind of an idiot.
1 Johnson didn’t stand a chance with his goofy ass. He always seemed high which isn’t s bad thing. I️ like he was for legalization. But I️ don’t want my president stoned all the time. Lastly he picked Jill stein as a running mate. Don’t get me wrong Jill has some solid ideas. But at the same time she has some bat shit insane ideas. Like how WiFi is making our kids dumber and we should take WiFi out of schools. 
1 No problem...I'm sure he'd also let you stay in one of his three houses rent free.
-3 im 25 and i have asked the same thing
-6 Thankfully, we seem to be seeing real time in Venezuela what people like Bernie would do to our country. 
1 I love sorting by controversial on these threads. It's the best way to see the really bat shit insane, out of touch comments like yours. 
1 Trump would've lost bigly, cuck.
1 When did he do the "shitty thing"
1 A trump supporter's confirmation bias is the strongest thing they have.
1 Only certain subreddits.
1 If you think Reddit loves Trump you are truly delusional.
1 Agreed
1 Yeah, because astronomical medical costs, debilitating student loan debt, an out-of-control prison system, mass shootings, lower income levels than the 1970's (adjusted for inflation) are just so fucking MAGA!
1 tbh, Trump isn't the one saying we need to redistribute the wealth. 
2 Ahhh okay. It’s the same tweet I believe 
-1 Or a repost.
1 The stuff they say on the campaign trail is not the stuff they do after they got the job. Apples to apples. Nice try to subvert my original argument though go back to your debate coach and tell him/her you gave it a good try.
1 Oh, ok thanks. 
-6 Trump pays a higher percentage. 
8 "Go back" hmm you mean you don't like people migrating to your sub and then refusing to assimilate?
3 Weird how everyone that screams for higher taxes has either made their fortune or is poor.
1 h hhhhh uhhhhh n c yee yee "when the thing that is going to your  house part y rock is in the h"
1 I think providing higher education is a noble goal with good intentions but if you really look at it, it's basically subsidies for the upper middle class, as they're they demographic that is prepared for college and would be best positioned to take advantage of it. If we were to instead provide pre-k education it would help smooth out a lot of the socioeconomic and racial disparities in successful students and set more students on the path towards college.
1 Sounds pretty fun to me!
1 Just like me!
-34 I'm not complaining about politicsi am complaining about the bernie circlejerk
1 Also did you actually check out my picture? Bet you enjoyed that;)
1 Lol. I'm constantly winning!!!  With my butt and even in puzzles and dragons. MAGA!!! Salty loser comments. Sad!
-8 Ah yes ignore the fact that Dems scream we are all going to die if we cut taxes and try to make a funny. Nice approach 
1 Please cite what is being c
-3 I agree there needs to be more attention on spending. Dems admit they will NEVER cut spending except military. Republicans just lie about it. 
1 Agree and not disputing that...either way though changes need to be made to SS no matter what. I don't support Trump's policies on the vast majority of things he does, but do 100% agree with him that regardless of what he said before, SS needs to be changed. Bernie is trying to use this all for political gain instead of trying to actually fix the problem that is SS going bankrupt. 
1 I didn't like my other name so I made a new account, so you can eat my butthole, troll.Edit: My name's Kyle too;))
1 Oh, communism is good because it's OLD? that's a really dumb thing to say lmao.
1 Lol good one
1 The core Trump supporters wouldn't have voted for anyone else no matter what.  Those Bernie Bots that thought they were "enlightened" either stayed home or voted 3rd party.  Those votes would have kept this nut job out of the White House.  Instead, we have a disasterous tax plan being drafted now, net neutrality is going away, we've pissed off countless people domestically and abroad, and the Supreme Court will be right-leaning for decades to come.  All so the Bernie Bots can stick it to the DNC.  Boy, they sure us!   /s
1 Enough of them voted for third parties/Trump to give Trump his victory in key states.
1 Isn't being a pathological liar a requirement to become a politician? 
1 Yeah maybe, a presidential race is just who's the best at telling people what they want to hear regardless of if it's true or not. Also corruption and money but yeah.  
3 So you just reposted it?

1 Thanks
2 I mean he's the only independent holding a leadership position in the DNC so he's not as much of an outsider as he was. I love me some Bernie but let's be real here. 
-42 >genuinely for the people>"white people don't know what it's like to be poor or live in ghettos"Pick one
1 As an amateur historian, history proves if we were going to we, The People, regardless of political affiliation, would've banded together long before we reached our current state of decay. Now, unfortunately, it's up to oligarchs and the powerful to try and save the sinking ship of state. Most are actively working against the interests of the country as a unified whole. Division, theft, and selfishness rule our age. 2nd Civil War, WWIII, and other domestic and foreign threats are wild cards in play. Bernie can't save us entirely - maybe at all. But we need something to believe in and powerful people we can trust. Institutions and govts are failing at all levels. At least Bernie hasn't sold out or given up yet. #StillSanders #Bernie2020
1 Said some politically astute random in Indiana. Saving this comment for Nov 9th, 2020. 
0 Yea it's politics. There's bullshit everywhere. Heaping piles of it just all over the place.
1 What bullshit? Please show me where there are cuts. 
1 lol okay
1 Same. Hate Bernie, *loathe* Trump. Wouldn't vote for Bernie in the primaries, but if he won the primary, I'd vote for him over Trump.
18 A recent one in particular comes to mind...
1 Looking at you fucking Alabama.
-7 Democrats had their committee and their vote sold to Hilary Clinton. If anyone robbed Bernie it her...funny her team was the first to start screaming about fake news and Russia...
1 Ah, the ol' Reddit [Trumparoo](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superbowl/comments/7hpcg8/meet_casper_who_decided_to_visit_our_office_today/dqt7a7u/?context=2)!
-5 Another persons senility is not a defense for this shitbag.Not sure your point. Anyone pushing 70 is too fucking old to be president, including trump. 100% I don’t think I’m stuttering when I say it,
-24 All those running were too old.No one pushing 70 should be president. Especially ones who print Tweets and look partially homeless.
1 oh shit I'll repost the memes from last time
1 dont bother, they dont understand irony.
2 Bernie is currently the most popular politician in the country.  He would do extremely well in Minnesota and Illinois, and I think he'd win Wisconsin too just like Obama.If Bernie went up against Trump then Bernie would win hands down.  
1 Midwest sucks. Fucking church groups protested a casino being built in my city because it would "Steal money from parents who would then go home and beat their children" (No shit that was their argument) so it was built the next county over and now that county gets the reap so many tax benefits that the high school graduates all get a free grant from the government for college.
1 Clearly you are. But thanks for being a liberal. Let’s me know that there is a truly pathetic person on earth 👍  Kinda like how a certain democratic representative  settled sexual assault cases with money from tax payers too. I’m sure you were fine with that as well. 
1 It would have been more interesting if he ran as an independent
1 because he blindly follows a team even if its bad for him...
1 https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/override_of_a_veto.htm

1 mmmmm sooooo salty. Comrade Sanders says "Give us your money and we will redistribute it fairly".
1 My commentYour head
1 BUT BUT COLLEGE WILL BE FREE!!!! MATCH ME!!!!!
1 Not by a pong shot.  We have over 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities with entitlement spending which will bankrupt the country very soon.
1 Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
1 One taxes and spends.The other borrows and spends.
1 Maybe he should show the big print of his voluntary payed higher taxes. He claims he believe in higher taxes, right?
1 If Bernie Sanders has his way we will all work for peas...
1 Uhm, I don't think so pal. I just looked it up, this is from January. It'd be trending and all that if he did it again.People are already reposting this fake news on twitter.https://twitter.com/Politics_PR/status/938163825593016326
1 We had a chance if folks voted for Hillary instead of buying into Bernie's bullshit that only he could save us...
1 Honestly it's all social media, not a court hearing.PLUS. The republicans said they are not going to slash Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. So why even bother printing out a HUGE tweet. thought the dems loved trees or something.
1 I don't know if I can take someone serious with this>Being fair to Obama, he inherited a mess of a country and sat in a house ruled by the opposite party. At the end of it all, he left country in a better place than he found it; In this in their comment history. 
-9 Feel the sarcasm 
-10 Not worries at all.  Just donated $100 to his campaign... MATCH ME!!!?
1 Closer to $50-$150 but if the Sand-man wants to keep printing up these tweets to show Trump as a hypocrite I'll let him use my discount at Fedex office.
-2 Doesn't he have three houses? There are people out there that don't have any houses. By his logic, he should give away 2 of his houses to people who have no houses. No longer will ornate mansions be just for the MILLIONAHHS and BILLIONAHHS.
-3 Free Lamborghini for every American!
1 Yes, he says ridiculous shit all the time. Not like Bernie is any better, just another lying asshole politician. 
-27 I was there and listened to his speech.
1 Nope, im not mad at him for that. Just confused how a thorough bred socialist would own multiple houses while others have none. 
1 I thought we were against coronations??
1 Yea, just like 2017 was Hillary's. Bernie sold out his voters the moment he backed the candidate who hijacked the funds of the whole democratic party. Bernie is a fraud. 
1 Only Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada. Couldn't believe she turned out to be the villain. Never saw it coming. 
1 I didn't vote for Trump. Bernie honeymooned in Soviet Russia and is a self proclaimed Socialist. He's a Commie through and through.
-2 You seem to be mixing up your ideologies there buddy. (I didn't vote for Trump)

35 Wrong. The FCC is going to kill n3t newtrality. Control all content and throttle out anything that isn't "on message" for the cable companies. Essentially, all the voices of the people will be choked out and you'll see no more funny cat videos. From individuals. Kiss all the original content goodbye.
24 Cat videos are so 2007 
1 Hey I just looked through your posts and I wanted to know, who is the Oakland killer?
1 how big of a covfefe table do you have to hold a book of that MAGAnatude?
1 A book of still thumbnails of cat videos.
42 Its almost as if holding politicians accountable to the platform they ran on was the point of democracy. Total shocker. 
27 Weird how people expect candidates to follow through on campaign promises that got them elected. 
19 You might have a point had he not changed his opinion on almost every discernible matter that he has ever had something to say about. 
13 Where do you draw the line then? At what point do we hold people accountable for the political statements they go 180° on, and at what point do we wave that quote around to deflect criticism of them for breaking their word?
11 Or maybe, it was absolutely clear to nearly everyone that those words were stated originally only to motivate the voters to support him. The he then, and now, had no intention of ever upholding that. That he then, and now, has no idea of the complexities of the issues. He sold us the sizzle with no idea of where the steak was coming from and how to prepare it. To claim that he fully intended to support the ideas expressed in his tweet based on the best of information available to a candidate, then later found out with new information available to him as president, that this just was not possible, and so took the only path available to him - cutting the programs - as a necessary evil to save the government from economic disaster. I think that may be the more intellectually dishonest idea than understanding he just lied. But hey - at least we have budgetary room to cut that evil estate tax right?
8 You know most people don’t like the tax plan regardless of this tweet. 
5 It'd be different if he acknowledged what he's said in the past and offered information as to why he has changed his stance as opposed to going "NUH UH!" If he had an ounce of intellectual honesty, he'd address that but he doesn't and won't. He's a lying con man and only has his interests in mind. And we're talking 2 years, not 20.
9 While typically I agree with you, there's little to indicate why such a shift would make sense from a policy standpoint as there's not much new information here.Generally your point applies to more dynamic issues like war support, technology, or longer term issues, like decades of building social pressure against misogyny, racism, or gay rights.2 years to abandon a fiscal position announced in a campaign on an issue with lines that haven't changed a lot requires more visible demonstration of what caused aj individual swing. The difference between a laudable change of position and a "flip flop" boils down to evidence and intent and i strongly challenge anybody to demonstrate that cutting instead of maintaining these programs can be objectively supported by new evidence acquired since that tweet. (And as an aside of course, Sanders who is doing the demonstration strongly believes in these programs and will want to gain that political point from the tweet)&nbsp;I do think we as a society should be MUCH better at understanding the evolution of complex issues, but i also stand by the challenge of showing that this particular one meets that standard.
3 I would be happy with someone standing by something he once said once in his life no matter as smart as it appeared because I do not agree with them politically
1 I agree most of the time with this logic and think we should be open to anyone keep an open mind and changing their ideas when presented with new facts or a different side but this was a tweet from 2015 where he was gloating about how he was the first candidate to stand behind not cutting these areas and even called Huckabee a copy cat.  Now he's doing a complete turn and it only makes him look like a fool in this context.  This is actually one of those times "flip-flopping" as conservatives loved to attack Gore with, is a destructive stance because he used it to get elected only to not follow through on a promise.  If he was against Gay marriange or against starting a war with a certain country but then started a discussion with memebers of the LGBT community or recieved more intel about this countries blame to start a full on nuclear war and his only chioce was to get in and end it then it would be a different discussion but this is more akin to straight up lying about what you promised.  
1 Or he could respond and say why his opinion has changed in the last 2 years (assuming it has changed and he isn't just saying things that people want to hear).
1 https://youtu.be/4BJEh78MAWc?t=10s
23 This is an example of a tweet. The **1/** at the end show it is intended to be a thread of multiple tweets. In a 5-tweet thread, it would typically go 1/, 2/, 3/, 4/, until the final tweet, say, 5/5. Due to the 140 character limit (now 280) it helps to show when the thought ends, so you aren't replying to them mid-statement.
2 I caught it was a joke, but am also aware it went over my head. I think a lot of people just don't have the context... And are probably not aware they are missing the joke or are vaguely aware and it makes us feel dumb so we get angry.
1 Because it’s actually a perfect target for a rediquette-aware downvote. It’s xompletely irrelevant and doesn’t add to the discussion in this thread.
3 screaming nut job prevails

1 Honestly that was the only way to save kinkos pretty much
1 FedEx is the shit for shipping BTW. As someone who ships a ton of stuff, FedEx is nearly always **considerably** less expensive than UPS unless you're shipping something really big (like 30+ lbs or large than a mini fridge).  FedEx customer service is also light years ahead. My local UPS store now charges $1.00 to tape your package and you have to pay to use their computer to print your label. FedEx does all of that for free.  I was mailing a camera a couple months ago and decided to get quotes from both. UPS Store was ~$90 and FedEx was ~$14. I'll never go back. 
1 and it still fucking sucks, except for the fact there are no other options really.

3 They don't need to defend him.  They vote.
1 It's great because if you point out a piece of criticism to a Trump supporter, then it'll be quickly branded as "Obviously fake news, MSM media!". Now if your Dear Leader™ itself is the critic... it's much harder to run away.

232 This can only happen if we vote in honest politicians like Bernie.

1 There also needs to be a cap on fundraising donations. Otherwise, you'll see a lot of cases of Nancy Q Comcast getting a $100k bonus then a $100k donation from the Nancy Q Comcast family to a politician.
1 Who do you give the funds to? Everyone who wants to run for Congress? Or just the people that the two main parties nominate? Both have their problems.A better solution is to do what we do in the UK and put a (fairly low) cap on spending. That way you have to raise SOME money but nothing like the amounts that are required in the US...
1 We definitely should, but keep in mind we had that forever. It wasn’t some utopia - lobbyists will lobby.
1 Hell, forget a mandate.  Just come up with a public funding system that's actually useable.  
1 Because we want to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money on commercials for people we don't like. That sounds ideal. 
1 What do you mean you by "publicly funded"? Aren't big corporations and billionaire donors part of the public? 
1 Money is free speech, remember? We'd need a constitutional amendment or the SC to reevaluate. Not sure how viable either of those are.
1 Yeah... And just how do you propose we do that?
1 Then what is to stop 50,000 candidates from running for each office, bankrupting your suggested system? 
-2 Then it'd literally just be candidates bribing the public with tax payer money.Worse than what we already see.

1 i'm 100% with you man. it was enough for people but the dnc rigged the rules against bernie. not to mention their ridiculous rules in some places where you had to register to vote in the primary 8 months before.
1 that's what everybody thinks. but i think more recently the number is up closer to 80% it's insane how much time they spend begging for money from like 100-200 different people. 
1 Only rich donors with convictions stick to one party. The rest know enough to bet on both sides so they win either way.
4 They spend the summer recess working in their districts, meeting stakeholders and constituents, and (essentially) campaigning. 
1 I suspect there was a fair vote on the matter. 
1 Most people try and take a vacation in the summer. 
10 > doing their jobCalling donors, asking for money is their job.
1 Damn, and here I thought listening to other members and discussing the bills and the impact of the future of our country was their job.
26 As an ecologist, just the idea of "draining the swamp" is such a god damned stupid thing.I get what he was going for, but it's almost a perfect metaphor for Trump's inability to understand the value of things he's trying to get rid of because uneducated folks are screaming for it.
0 He drained a swamp, then filled Capitol Hill with it. 
1 Or maybe you ARE wrong and you think that throwing a cranky geezer tantrum is sufficient as a good counter-point in a discussion. Feel free to correct anything I say that's wrong with material evidence, not just by typing with the same attitude you had while receiving your first colonoscopy. 
1 Yes liberals commit the vast majority of rapes that is a fact. The Law of Liberal projection means that you are a rapist (or worse)
1 I agree, I'd love to walk to work, but I live nearly 30 miles away from work.  :(
1 I walk to work every day, fifteen minutes. It's great. You don't have to spend money on fuel or public transport every week. Your mood is better when you haven't been sitting in peak hour traffic too.
1 Let's hope he runs in 2020. Midterms are important too, but damn, imagine Dems crushing the Republicans in 2020 and we get Bernie in the WH.
14 Metro is the generic name (internationally), subway the specific analogue to the underground.
17 You're right but as someone who lives in the D.C. Area and has spent a lot of time in NYC it's just something people care about.
4 but metro is the generic name. 
2 Subway isn't necessarily wrong, but Metro is a more inclusive word. 
3 Because it goes all over the Metro area. Well into Maryland and Virginia. In a few years, it will extend all the way to Dulles Airport, which is in Dulles, VA, 26 miles from DC.
2 Honors the Paris subway called the metropolitan. Our police is also MPD for metropolitan police department. 
1 Underground in the center, above to the burbs. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit (I think, been away for a few years). Metro. Rome calls theirs the Metro as well, btw.
1 It’s largely underground in DD proper, but above ground in DC Metro area. 
1 Because it isnt all underground.
1 It's both but mostly underground.
1 It's both. In DC it's mostly underground but as you get farther out it's mainly surface level. But it is indeed referred to as the DC Metro.
1 The T in Boston, the L in Chicago, the Metro in DC and LA, The BART and the Muni in San Francisco, the MAX in Portland. 
1 [deleted]
0 Technically Subway refers only to the subterranean part of the metropolitan rail system. I believe NYC is the only major city where this is the colloquial term used for the entire system. You might say it's the term in American English, but every American city that has a subway system, apart from NY, calls it by a different name.
-1 Everybody knows Trump is rich and part of the 1%. Bernie claims to be for the people but his behaviour is opposite that.
-2 ...no one mentioned TrumpThis is some crazy projection. You okay?edit: apparently he's not okay. I hate Trump as much as the next guy but that comment is just hilarious.
-2 Cadillac*
-2 Damn what an own! It turns out Bernie’s family simply inherited a 600k home and sold it to buy another 600k home. Normal American thing to have happen to you!!!
-13 Truth hurts, huh?

-3 Such a proletarian move to inherit a half a million dollar home and then sell it to buy another half a million dollar home closer to you.
1 Maybe people take issue with it that somebody who honestly believes that they should have a say in how much others can earn has a third home that is worth 600k.
23 One Alabama voter stated something like :How can we choose between a  pedophile and someone who believes in abortion.  To some of those voters, they are same amount of evil.. Being republican tips the scale. 
323 To me, "dating" teenagers is creepy, but that's not nearly the worst thing about this guy. He was a lawyer, sworn to uphold the law, elected to the highest judicial office in the state, and he openly said he didn't give a fuck what the law was if it conflicted with his religious beliefs.  You know how hard it is for a judge to get thrown off the bench? How egregious his behavior has to be for other judges to go against him? He was thrown off TWICE.
153 From someone who lives in Alabama, this situation is infuriating. He is a literal piece of fucking garbage, but he still gets endorsed and is more than likely going to win because of all of the ass backward, close minded people that live here. Literally half the people I've talked to don't even know who the candidates are and are just voting Republican blindly.
7 Why isn't he in prison?
10 This is how we can make Puerto Rico a state and still have 50 states so we don't need a new flag. See ya, Alabama.
0 16 is age of consent in Alabama.Also, "hey look a supposed signature is in a a year book. That equals rape" isn't evidence in court. Maybe in buzzfeed world it is, but not in any respectable court.If you really disliked child molesters you should bring to light tony and john podesta's emails
-2 Other red states will follow suit.  Hell, an orange rapist was elected president.
-87 Look i'm no fan of trump or the republicans, but i'm also no fan of globalists who look to derail elections with character assasinations like this. Where is the yearbook? No evidence!
-20 Have you any actual proof? Allegations are allegations, and Moore has denied the allegations, so as far as I'm concerned, it's he said-she said. And I believe in the concept of "innocent until proven guilty".
1 As their voters start dying they'll vote for more Medicare cuts and blame Democrats saying it's over funded and mismanaged. 
1 I agree. They’re taking advantage of our ignorance, apathy, and biological tendency towards tribalism. The solution isn’t going to look pretty.
-1 I know, I'm over here like, "Yeah no shit we need to cut social security." 
29 These "benefits" are designed to help more than the recipient.  Do we really need a workforce of people punching in in their 90s because there's no retirement income available?  Do you want your parents/grandparents to become destitute, losing whatever savings they have on a single hospital stay?  Do you want them moving in with you when they can no longer live on their own?  Do you want to have to turn down a new opportunity in a new town, because you have to stay home and take care of Meemaw?  Social Security and Medicare were designed to take the burden of aging from the younger generation, to make them more mobile and give them more options and opportunities.  Finding ways to get the old folks out of the way is going to be more crucial than ever, as more and more Baby Boomers reach retirement age.  If they stay on the job, that's one fewer job available to you, or your children.  If they suck down what savings they have to pay medical bills, they'll be leaning on you for a handout, or a place to live when they have to sell the house to pay their bills.  Their benefits are your benefits.  It doesn't matter who's paying the freight.  What matters is that, with the government's help, you can live _your_ life while your elderly antecedents live theirs.  That's what's important, here.
7 You forget those "someone else your benefits are taken from" get way more money from their work than they deserve. You also forget that someone someone else also gets those benefits.
3 No.
4 bloat = part of the program that doesn't help people I care about
8 So you're gonna stop running a deficit by... cutting taxes (on the rich), and thus the amount of money the government has to work with? OK.
4 Yet they passed a bill to add $1 trillion to the deficit. Lol 
2 Are you fucking kidding me?  No they're not, do you know nothing about the tax bill that just fucking passed?  They are taking all the money away from poor and middle class people.  Did you even watch the video?  They just gave insane tax cuts to the wealthy, and fucked the middle class on taxes.  They don't care how the tax cuts affect the deficit, cuz they plan to make it up by taking away Medicare, Medicaid, SS.  Either you're just making up bullshit or you don't know wtf is going on, read up on the tax bill they just passed, idiot.  
1 As someone who works daily with the elderly, their benefits are FAR from bloated. A broken hip can result in the loss of their home, their savings, everything.Being moved into assisted living? Costs at least 2k a month, guess who pays that? Sure as shit not the government. Wanna make cuts, start with our extremely bloated military budget.

22 Nice idea though, keep going!
1 Somebody say pinch pennies ?!
145 d) Hilary
42 Is C not the reason why most even voted for the man? They were sick of politicians and he's different? This world is seriously overdue for a plague.
19 > a) It's not his fault the Republican congress is fighting his agenda.> > > > b) If trump does even a [insert fraction here] of what he promised he'll make me happy.> > > > c) All of them lie to get into office. It's what politicians do.RetortsA) Trump never really had an agenda, and he has no legislative experience, so he was always going to have to rely on Congress. He has no political experience. He will sign any GOP bill put on his desk.B) I don't even know. Don't care if they get screwed along the way?C) I thought Trump "told it like he is" or "was different." Also, Trump still lies now that he's in office. The lying never stopped. 
3 C) but he was elected because people believed he wasn't a politician. I'm lost for words here.
1 The cognitive dissonance is real. 
1 Some part of this is also the fact that he cultivated a following being a reality TV show star. In reality TV people say and do outrageous and horrible things for entertainment, and I think that factors into how Trump supporters view him. He can say or do anything and they don't take him as seriously. If he says X, but does the opposite, well "he's just being Trump" and its excusable. 
26 Oh it'll be fake news right up until they need medicare/medicaid. 
30 Wow. Fuckin' in-laws
1 What do they claim is fake news? The truth that he tweeted this?
1 Can you tell me when he cut any of those things?You can't because he didn't and any claims he did would be fake news.
1 That's what my step dad says about these types of issues. "The media is always trying to make fake news on trump."  Can't change the supporters.
-1 They aren't, but the people in them sure are.
-1 Well, HRC wasn't really an option.
35 "He's not cutting MY benefits!"
27 "Whoopsies. Honey, your momma done fucked up."
17 Not even, those people will defend him to the end.
3 More likely to be "It's all LIBRUL MEEDYA lies! Schumer and Pelosi are taking my social security, not god-emperor Trump!"
0 "Yeah, we should have believed the millennials and nominated a socialist."
15 I don't know his mother but statistically I would guess stubbornly doubling down
2 This will be a word before he is through. He also brings new meaning to the word trump/trumped:"beat (someone or something) by saying or doing something better."
1 No, they haven't.
1 Medicare & Medicaid were cut in the budget. The GOP is talking about Social Security now too, and they'll almost assuredly be back for more in other areas too.
1 Bernie challenging Trump to reaffirm his stance, stand up to GOP leadership, and the current GOP efforts to move in this direction.

19 A few years ago I used to get annoyed when people cited that movie how the world is moving towards Idiocracy (I still don't think the world is, but USA is at this point *flying* towards it, not moving).And The_Dunaldinger is still 500k f******ds strong. After everything Trump has done...
1 Terry Crews for president!
1 And a popular ex-wrestler is considering running for president in 2020
1 If I recall, the movie was meant to be a cautionary tale about the smarter people letting it get that way, rather than the stupid taking over.I think this article goes into explaining it https://thewretchedryanenglish.com/2012/08/24/why-idiocracy-is-just-a-little-bit-misunderstood/
1 I'll cite something different:  [The Argument Clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y)
1 Dude.. people didn't vote for him because of anything he said or did. Republicans vote for the letter by the name and that's it.
1 I mean he's literally a man who bragged about being humble. This is the new normal.
1 Family Guy ripped on this huge. I think Lois was running for Mayor. I don't have time to look it up, but her speech was along the lines of:> Vote for me, and Jesus will save us from 9/11.She would have won if Peter didn't betray her.
-1 Even more than that, our country is incredibly biased when it comes to Politcal Parties. For most republicans, nothing that Trump does will be wrong simply because he's a republican. Just like how so many Democrats blindly followed Hilary Clinton. It's so hard to get things done because both parties are too defensive of fellow party members when they should be calling out things that are done wrong, regardless of "Which side they're on". George Washington was right...
0 Everyone thinks they’re some clever little shit that knows everything. It’s like living in a country populated entirely by those irritating people who insist on narrating movies and tv shows with how *they’d* do things so much better than the characters themselves. Spend 10 minutes on Reddit and I guarantee you someone will start arguing with you over what exact shade of blue the sky is.
1 He's definitely taking that 'allowance' over the cliff side. 
-10 Well yall handed more and more power to the US government. A government big enough to give you everything is a government big enough to take it all away. I'll be ok, and as long as this country keeps putting more and more power in DC the less I care if the rest of the country drowns. I'll survive the shit show, I'm not so sure about the rest of you tho.
25 That show made me want to drink mojitos every time I went to a restaurant. 
11 Gracias, I literally just copy/pasted this from the first Google result for "burn notice intro." I didn't put too much time into my copypasta

1 This fucking thread is filled with children who desperately want the federal government to have significant control of our lives, and then blame people who want smaller government for "tearing down democracy". What a fucking joke.
20 Which means it is a Democracy.
14 I too have learned the art of pedantically annoying the shit out of people who all know we are talking about the same thing.
25 Because it makes them feel smart despite the fact that it makes them look dumb.It's the equivalent of a cheap parlor trick.  It works if you're not very knowledgeable or easily impressed.  But the rest of us see it for what it is and just roll our eyes.
4 Appreciate the downvotes but you are wrong, by any definition of a Democracy USA is one. "a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.""is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament.""a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system."USA is a Representative Democracy, we are a Democracy.

1 ayyyy
1 The Great Depression wasn't started by the USA.Black Tuesday was started by the crash in London a month or so prior.
2 The stock market crash was a consequence of circular debt.  In short, US banks failed because they weren't repaid.  People panicked, and they pulled their money out of the stock market.  
4 I don't want to rain on your parade, but most computers count time from January 1st 1970, so they can't actually be turned back that far...
1 He isn't reducing funding though. The funding will increase from the previous year.
2 Just found this:https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/tax-bill-2017/card/1510696375is this not true?
8 they dont like to focus on facts.  
1 So you're arguing semantics here, but it's a fucking stupid practice since it doesn't even make you right. Medicare spending will increase 82 percent over the next 10 years, instead of the previously agreed on 99 percent. If you and your boss had an agreement that you were to get a 99 cent raise annually and you only received 82 cents, would you consider that to be a cut in your pay?
1 What's wrong with what they said?
1 It's so cute watching the left try to use the same insults that are used against them. 
3 ...taxes? Which are as low as they've been in our nation's history, by the way. It's not as if we'd need to tax anyone into poverty to help our seniors.If our workforce is so young and huge that the "support ratio" noted in your article will plummet by 2100, we should be investing in that workforce's future by strengthening Social Security, not weakening it. What's the alternative? A future where we have a glut of individuals who can't work, and receive no pension?
-3 Maybe from the top 1% in the form of taxes.
1 This is what happens when the birth rate slows down. People can't afford children and are having less of them. Even if they did, there are not enough living-wage jobs to support them. The money will have to come from the demographics that can afford to pay for it.
-1 What do you suggest?
2 So we have another 4 years of Trump, or a replacement, as is tradition 
1 > There is not even a one percent chance she could win against anybody now that she has lost to Trump.Not true. Look at the recent history of our presidents. Unless they get reelected, it almost always goes d-r-d-r-d-r... If she's the dem candidate next election, she will probably win
2 Don't hate the 2 party system, hate the first past the post method of voting, which naturally gravitates towards 2 people most people don't like.Instant runoff is much better and can't split the vote because you have as many votes as there are candidates.
1 I loved Gary Johnson and he did everything in his power to guarantee that I couldn't vote for him last election. That being said - I believe there's a rule that you need X% of the vote (something like 5%) to be on the national debate stage (or it's polling at X%, I can't remember) - it's sad that people are so wed to a party that we can't even get 5% to vote for a 3rd party candidate. 
1 >Between Trump and HRC I feel like there was no really good option for us to pick.There were plenty of other options.  They just lost to those two.  Having another party isn't really going to change that.
1 I think it's really likely dems and reps are playing both sides. Wouldn't surprise me if Trump and Hillary planned this out. Think about it, both candidates lowered the bar so much. a few decades back I doubt either would have stood much a chance. But the loser of this election can just run again next time, and their "opponent" will have lowered the bar so much it will be a piece of cake to win. That way both of them are basically guaranteed a win during different elections.Also something to consider next election, if neither main candidate appeals to you vote third party. It may seem pointless but it beats not voting, at least if enough people vote 3rd party it will increase their funding and odds of winning down the line.
0 Trump is his own party. Maybe Bernie could say the same if he had a set, but he folded like a cheap suit after the primaries.
0 Grow some balls young man. Don't leave the the space blank out of fear. Follow your intuition 
1 Wtf are you even on about?  Bernie campaigned all throughout the South during the primaries. I saw him in New Orleans after he had just spent the previous days in TX. In fact, he was the ONLY Democrat to campaign throughout this region and that paid attention to us and didn't just right us off as a lost cause.
1 Be aware while replying to above poster u/pylons. This is a known troll of the anti-semetic hate subreddit r/enough_sanders_spam. The users live in a toxic perpetual relitigation of the 2016 presidential election and look to perpetuate circular debates they already know the answers to. Dont waste your time feeding the trolls as they have no interest in actual discussion only establishment propaganda.
1 A lot can change in the next three years...  but if you pay attention to how she's behaving and what you'd expect someone to do to build support for another run...
8 Hillary only has ever held one elected position, and it was because JFK Jr. died in a plane crash during the election primaries. 🤔🤔🤔
1 She wasn't the most qualified candidate ever. 1.5 term Senator and 4 year Secretary of State.Contrast that with someone like George H.W. Bush, who was a Congressman, Director of the CIA, and Vice President. Or Richard Nixon, who was a Navy Commander, Congressman, Senator, and Vice President.Or LBJ, who was a Congressman and Senator for a quarter century, part of the Senate and House leadership, and Vice President.And that isn't even including the Founders, who *literally formed the country and wrote the Constitution.*So, no, she's not even close to the most qualified.
1 So he wants everybody to be poor.
2 Most Americans couldn't place Syria on a map. I'd rather have Johnson over Me.Covfefe
2 Lol if that's the worst thing you can say about Johnson that puts him miles ahead of the other candidates.
6 Lol if Aleppo is the worst thing you can say about Johnson that puts him miles ahead of other candidates. 
1 Didn’t he recall immediately after being prompted and gave a rather eloquent stance?IMO that humanized him even more to me. The guy fucked up, had his memory refreshed, replied, then later apologized and admitted his short comings. I’d kill to have that in a politician.Right now we have a guy who can’t admit covfefe was a typo.
1 I just want to point out that that question was so terrible I doubt the person who wrote it had any grasp of what was happening in Aleppo at the time.
1 You're getting the two parties mixed up: The Libertarian Party nominated Gary Johnson, who took former Republican Bill Weld as his running mate. The Green Party nominated Jill Stein, who picked Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.
1 actually no,Venezuela is an example of a resource based economy suffering from a resource depression
1 A false comparison, as usual. 
-1 Wat?!Edit: sorry I should’ve just responded, “I rest my case”
1 No, Venezuela is failing because of [made up bullshit reason number 1].  It’s not because of socialism, because socialism works.  Socialism works, because if it didn’t work, it’s not real socialism.  Just try it again.  If it still doesn’t work, don’t worry, because it’s not real socialism.
1 I thought I was the only one who did this.
1 I remember reading a study done, I don't remember specifically who conducted it (I may be wrong but maybe Pew Research). The poll recorded how citizens would feel voting for a particular religion of the candidate. Americans felt more confident voting in a Muslim before an Atheist (the least liked). If Bernie were to be the nominee, he'd be destroyed. Not only on his religious views, but his hard left ideology and blunders in wording (ex: when you're white you don't know what it's like to be poor). Bernie would've failed hard.
1 You're the one who is "out of touch". I like Bernie a hell of a lot more than Hillary, but he would have been destroyed in the general election. Purple states simply would not vote for him.
1 My comment is out of touch? Really? What about it is out of touch? Nothing I said is false in anyway.
1 Jokes are hard!
1 So are the people who voted for Trump. 
1 You trump supporters just keep lowering the bar for studpidity.

1 Way to stay on topic.

1 Nah it's all OC here.
1 Nah it's all OC here.
1 Yes because the richer you are the higher percentage you pay. Hypothetically Lets say Trump pays 40% taxes where as I pay 20%Lets say Trump makes $50mil a year while I make $28k.Trump would keep $30mil Which is more than plentyI would keep $22400 which is enough for me to live comfortable.If I had to pay 40% I would only have $16800 and I couldn't afford my house.If Trump paid 20% that $10000000 that no longer goes to pay for schools, police, hospitals, roads, etc because it lines trumps pockets.Tax brackets are a good thing.
1 Trump paid 3% less of his total income than the average American tax payer in 2005.  http://amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2017/03/15/donald-trump-2005-tax-returnsAnd on top of that we and you don’t even know what the fuck he’s been paying since then. 
9 Don't we have no idea what Trump pays because he refuses to release his taxes? And don't we also have evidence Trump at the very least strenuously avoids taxes, which he thinks, "makes [him] smart"? Taxes seem a very odd angle from which to attack Bernie Sanders in defence of Trump.(Edit: grammar)
-1 Brutal
-1 🤣
-2 +1
1 Haha yeah he's old that means he's bad st politics and you're more qualified than he is, right ?!!!
1 Why not both?
14 Why would it end. Hes still a politician fighting for what he believes in. Its not like he has to quit politics forever because he lost the Dem primary 
1 He is still a politician and brought up how hypocritical trump is by using one of his tweets. Literally I️ would circle jerk McConnell if he had the balls to do that. It’s not about the person it’s about the actions. People circle jerk Bernie because he stands for the American people. But keep sucking off the 1 percent and see how far that gets you. 
2 What? How is this funny? Trump blatantly lying is funny to you?
1 [deleted]
1 If they were honest about it, true fiscal conservatives would have been better able to compete with tea party/Trumpsters/whatever they call themselves now because I think a lot of people understand the concept of a balanced budget and that the government should keep one too, but its pretty obvious that the GOP in power have little intention to even try maintaining a balanced budget.  
1 And you're happy about that or?
0 Yes. It is not just a shitpost, but a policial shitpost Repost. Shame.
-5 No Bernie is press Trump again now that the Senate version of the bill has passed.
1 Haha 50 years ago.  Meanwhile Trump advocated sexual harassment on a bus with Billy bush a few years ago.  The things you guys reach for is hilarious
24 Finish the quote, please.>>When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor. You don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.He was responding to a question as to what his own "racial blind spot" is, and he was commenting on the experience of inner-city blacks. Poor choice of words, but nothing to indicate that he abandoned his decades-long crusade to help the poor and less fortunate...
17 He obviously misspoke. He means poor white people don't have to deal with institutional racism on top of being poor, which is completely true.He comes from a state that 99% white. It's not like he's anti white lol
11 Is that the best you can do to try to find something bad about Bernie?
1 Who’s from Indiana?
1 One is a heaping pile of elephant shit. The other is a pile of donkey shit. Yeah--shit everywhere...but let's not pretend its equal. 
1 The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 says "paygo" programs (Medicare) will be cut if congress passes a budget that increases the deficit without bringing money in. The CBO estimates Medicare will be cut by $25 billion. --Snopes (https://www.snopes.com/2017/12/04/does-republican-bill-cut-medicaid/)
0 It's not even that anymore. She openly admits on Trevor Noah's failure of a show that she paid a law firm to build the Trump/Russia dossier. Her defense was "Well it's completely normal for one candidate to seek out dirt on the other". Yet, Trump JR. Is supposed to be imprisoned for reading the email offering up dirt on HRC? These inconsistencies are why people are gravitating to Trump. The system was rigged in every possible way against him, and people do not trust the system anymore. 
4 Grab my pussy, I'm going in!
2 Cool opinion, bro.
4 So now physical apperance dictates if they're going to be a good president or not?
-14 >Bernie is currently the most popular politician in the country.  Hahaha>If Bernie went up against Trump then Bernie would win hands down.  HAHAHAHA
1 congress could never provide a 2/3 majority on a tax plan, simply not possible with party lines, trump still very much holds the veto power
1 Your gross oversimplifications do nothing constructive and only serve to push the false narrative that "both parties are the same" They are not.

7 Cool so you can provide some quotes to support your assertion?
1 Everyone clapped, Obama was there, and Bernie gave you $100 right after an 8 year old explained why gay marriage is perfectly fine to a bigoted 60 year old woman after she tried to shame a women with short blue and pink hair right?
1 Don't forget the ritual sacrifice of your firstborn to appease satan. Oh and also he said that money will trickle down from the sky if we just pray hard enough. Wait, that's Trump's tax plan. And it hasn't rained money, ever.  
1 Then he spent almost every waking moment fighting a corrupt administration. Winner in my book. 
1 He's a self proclaimed Democratic Socialist which is entirely different than the Marxism you're accusing him of. In reality, he's really just a Social Democrat in the same realm as FDR. Most modern, developed nations are social democracies to some degree, so stop the red baiting crap.

1 This should be a talking point against the FCC vote coming up.  If cat videos are threatened I would expect capitol hill to be SWARMED with people.  It would be historic.

1 The point of our democracy (in America at least) was supposed to be nonpartisanship. George Washington abhorred the idea of separate political parties as he likely viewed them as a danger of fracturing our union into separate governments and countries entirely. Ours has been a shaky bipartisanship indeed, but our rapidly growing political division and the election based solely on revenge we're having to endure should mark the beginning of the end for political parties in America. The real silent majority who doesn't vote along party lines or for single issues has dealt with more than enough hardships caused by the party system. It's time we returned to voting for candidates based on how they propose to help the people they represent and the country as a whole instead of helping the corporations who buy their support and vote solely for the policies of their party instead of voting for the needs of their constituents and respecting the will of the people. 
-9 By all means, feel free to do that. But to think a populist won't cut taxes is laughably naive.
1 Weird how people expect candidates belonging to a political party to have their best interests in mind.
1 Just remember how big of a deal was made with Gore and his flip-flopping but I'm sure those same people are concerned with Trump's complete change around on a number of issues.  
1 He could, but would you listen if he did? Would you agree with it? Are you informed on the debt crisis those social programs have on the future of america? Are you aware of the coming Diabetes Epidemic that could very well bankrupt your nation by 2050 if things don't start changing quick?Social networks are not viable permanent solutions, they only function in the short term.
1 How do you make it happen? I use Twitter pretty rarely, but it seems like when I do my thoughts exceed the character limit. I always see threads like that but have never been able to do it. 
0 I don't use twitter, but why does everyone go "140 char limit (now 280)"....why not just say 280 character limit? Unless somehow the new limit is in a "beta phase"...
1 It's not completely irrelevant. If you apply those standards, the preceding tweet about cat videos is at the very least *almost* completely irrelevant. This comment isn't about *Justice League*, it's a humorous take on a tweet being presented before congress.
1 Then all these comments are irrelevant and don’t add to the discussion because we’ve gone pretty far off the original topic.

7 Voting for the indefensible is a grossly unethical action.  
1 A net of 49 thousand people upvoted this picture with no idea what they were looking at.That is insane.
169 The people tried and lost. The coup on washington was lost in the 70s, money won.
21 Won't happen even then. We need a supreme court justice that would side with striking down Citizens United. Thanks to Trump and Gorsuch that ain't happening in a Bernie presidency.Honestly, I hope the short gamers who didn't vote for Hilary because she was such a bad candidate, I hope they realize that by not getting that Supreme Court seat, it meant we are going to get fucked by corporations until another Republican justice dies or retires which could be 5-10 years. Not to mention if Bader-Gonsburg dies this term. It's a lot more important than just one person. In normal situations I would have told you to sit it out if you felt like it, but this last election was important... We were so close to taking over the Supreme Court and we got absolutely fucked by people staying home. 
59 Didn't everyone vote for Bernie already? Then the DNC decided you didn't know what was best for you?
1 I like Bernie, but I think it goes beyond that. We need transparency and accountability built into the system, instead of trying to find unicorns.
1 Hahaha! The DNC put a stop to that too. You are all fucked.
1 You realize that he rolled over and endorsed the woman who cheated him out of his deserved and hard fought nomination, right?
1 Or Clinton, who was the literal subject in Citizen's United. 
1 Shame he’s a socialist. 
-3 Bernie stopped feeling honest when he backed Clinton despite her quite literally stealing the election through blatant corruption, and refused to do or say anything on the subject when proof came to light.He stopped being someone different, and started being just another tally mark on one side of the aisle or another.
-2 HAHAHAHAHHAA
-16 *Bernie**Honest*Pick one.
-7 Really? Honest? His.wife is under investigation for stealing from a college. He tells us to share the wealth while he owns 2 homes and a rolls Royce. Do your research before you talk out your ass
1 He is currently 10 million dollars short of honest. 
1 The socialist who's like us, except for his three houses. 
1 We got a lot of people so don't think we can't handle more than one problem at a time.  But yes I get your sentiment.
5 This isn't about vision of "their papers" this is publicly controlled campaign funds and platforms where they all run on.  No tv ads that aren't shared access, no debates without all candidates.  Force the entire selection process to be outside of private funding.
1 And why not already make people seeking public office have to open all funding related to seeking an election?  We don't need to open their piggy bank unless they say they are using their personal funds.
1 That is so beyond false.  Candidates already have to disclose all contributions to and expenditures by the campaign.  Even PACs and SuperPACs have disclosure requirements.  It's just that disclosure alone isn't enough to fix the problem.  
1 Sure a mix of both ideas is still a good direction to go.
1 Let them lobby after our elected officials are elected.  But why muddy the waters while the public is trying to determine the best candidate.  There is a difference between the best candidate with the biggest campaign fund and the one found to be the best from an open and neutral election process.
4 Local government's control the amount the candidates receive from their local taxes.  In order to receive funding you would need to pass steps that would eliminate most people gaming the system.  Such as reimbursements instead of giving out checks on day 1.  Or you can just divide the alloted money by the number of candidates.
1 Public matching seems promising.  You still raise money, but you do it by raising small amounts from people that can actually vote for you instead of big money, and the government gives you a match (they do 6:1 in NYC) so that those small donations become big enough to actually compete with big money.  
1 Violent revolution?
1 Really?  You think this is how it would fail?  Your problem solving is severely lacking.
5 What?  Not sure what you are saying.How do you think campaigns run via wealthy donors work?  Only the best puppets currently get backed.  Take out their ability to fund campaigns and you get candidates from the interested public paid for by the public.  Isn't that better?
1 Translation: "Now politicians will be held accountable by their constituents, because if they get pissed they'll pull their money." Why is this a bad thing?
2 Only if you are determined to be pessimistic and unwilling to try something new.
1 For them to out campaign the next guy....where they'll ignore the people and give kickbacks to highest donor. 
2 If you're REALLY good at it, maybe even a president!
1 > Damn, and here I thought listening to other members and discussing the bills and the impact of the future of our country was there job.Most of that isn't done on the floor. Mostly political stuff is done on the floor. All of the stuff you are describing is done at the offices across the street.
1 Thank you! Why do people have it out for swamps? They can be an important part of biodiversity hotspots. 
1 Out of curiosity: what actually happens if you drain a swamp? Do you get fertile soil? Or do you end up with dried up clay? Would it be suitable to build houses on?
1 it's not that....it's your condescending "i know how everything works, and I will tell everyone how it works" attitude that probably drives people away from you at parties.
1 Wow.  I'm at a loss for words.  
1 Subway stands for subterranean railway. Any train system underground is a subway. Metro is metropolitan transit system. Any transit system can be a metro.So they're basically both correct and generic. No reason to argue about this. 
1 I think subway specifically refers to underground in general
1 Nah, subway is used generically too.
1 As someone who recently moved to DC and has spent a lot of time in NYC it drives me crazy that people care so much about it
1 Damn metrosexuals
6 To you. Metro to me means a collection of cities, or a crappy old car. We call what you are referring to as The Skytrain, or the more encompassed term is Transit ( buses and Skytrain) 
1 Here's the thing about subway and metro taxonomy... 
3 Which behavior is that specifically?
1 His wife inherited a house. Even if her family were ultra mega rich, so what? How does that make him a hypocrite? The fact that this is the most “scandalous” thing about him just makes it clear how clean he actually is. People are desperate to find anything to discredit him, and the best they can come up with after 20 years in public office is to point to his wife inherenting a house. Lol.
7 well with no evidence, no.. 
1 That is not what we are asking for a source on.
1 But remember, the other members of the 1% are the people robbing you blind. Not the champagne socialist that has three different homes. The guy who never had a real job until he was 40 and then made a career by promising free shit and renaming post offices, literally got kicked out of a commune for refusing to work while solely ranting about politics and said that white people don't know what it is to be poor, that guy is the person that really fights for the common man. It would be fucking hilarious if he ran again and this entire site donated their lunch money again, because he will never win. A self admitted socialist that has visited or praised almost every radical leftist regime in his life time and hung a Soviet flat in his office. Yeah, not going to happen.
5 And yet they pray to the biggest abortionist in human history. But killing the unborn is just part of his “plan”, you know?
-2 If something came out proving that all the allegations against him are completely false and were made up to destroy his credibility and win the seat for a Democrat would you call for the democrat to step down and give the seat to Roy Moore if he wins? Witch hunts have happened in the past and we could very well be in the beginning of one now. People lie for all sorts of reasons, duke lacrosse, rolling stone fraternity gang rape, etc.. Shouldn’t we as a society assume people are innocent until proven guilty? The American justice system is based on that right? Who are you and I to just decide he is guilty because accusations have been made even though he denies it? Think of the precedent it sets in politics if an easy win in an election comes from having some women accuse the other candidate of sexual assault. We have all seen how dirty American politics get, fake accusations wouldn’t shock me in the least. 
-22 And the democrats defended Clinton and voted for people who defended him, let's not act as if Democrats are any more rational 
173 He grabbed an underage girl by the neck and forced her head down to his crotch. After she got away and out of the car he left her in an alley and she had to find another way home.

118 ehhhh. He is a sexual predator that groped and sexually violated minor(s).But, losing your elected office because of showing contempt for the constitution should be exclusionary for running for federal office, yes.
37 You make a very good point, there were plenty of things that should have been disqualifying for Roy Moore, and that is before noting that he is at minimum a super creep and in all likelihood a molester.
13 His clear conflict of interest should get him thrown out of any position of power.His child molestation and rape should have him thrown in prison.
1 What religious beliefs. The only thing he worships is himself. 
1 Yes yes yes.  THIS is why I hate Roy Moore- as Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice, he chose to SHIT on the US Constitution.  Roll Tide.
49 why you have to fight, find 100 people and convince them to vote jones, and tell each of them to find 100 people

9 Oh, they know who he is. Their options are:Child molester, orDemocratTo a republican one of these things is the worst crime imaginable.Edit:fixed some pretty important spacing

2 He's a Donald shill pay him no mind. 
1 Tax bills don't set budgets, and vice-versa. The problem is that they aren't making a careful analysis so they can see that since they're budgeting so much spending, they can only cut taxes (and all other revenue sources) so much in order for it to even out.
1 The elderly aren't the only beneficiaries of social security. I accept that the military budget should also face cuts as well.
1 I'm looking at the video and it's the same clothes. The image is from the video you post. From today.

1 > Don't care if they get screwed along the way?Here's the thing: most of them (the approx 400k voters in swing states who elected trump) have been getting screwed for a long time, even under Bush. They've seen their houses get repossessed, 401ks drained and then Obama comes along and says "hey y'all all have to get insurance now" and tacks on another bill for them to pay month to month. That was the genesis of the tea party and it's just metamorphosed into Trumpism.  So that's why mid/low class retirees voted for this guy in droves. They've got nothing to lose anymore

1 My in-laws are seniors on Medicare.https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/senate-tax-medicare-cuts-fd.htmlMy discussion with the in-laws was about these changes.  President Trump supports the new Tax bill.  He knows about the Medicare cuts.Therefore, he is going back on his word if he allows the tax bill to move forward as-is.If President Trump vetos the tax bill, or does not allow it to move forward without removing the Medicare cuts, then he would be keeping his word on Medicare.Can we both agree that the above statements are correct and not fake news?

In a lot of ways it's like those self proclaimed "Christians" whose actions don't resemble anything taught through Christianity. Sanders was always the guy who represented the Democratic party's ideals but you wouldn't know that if you dismissed everything else and just accepted the word of the DNC and MSM, believing their choice was the best choice.

1 What can I say, liberalism is a (mental) disease.
1 There's a keen difference between "smaller government" and "let's just turn all that money we saved up in taxes for healthcare and living funds at old age into overzealous military spending that no one but private weapons companies and paid politicians want."Social programs that are voted on and approved is not government control, it's the people making a decision to work to take care of each other financially, with the (again chosen by the people) government as the one to oversee the process to assure it's success. The only children here are the ones afraid of the government for existing because they don't understand its limitations, it's purpose, or it's design. Be afraid and climb under the sheets, but shut the fuck up about it because I'm really tired of people who can't fathom how the nation works and choose to flip out like idiots whenever they don't understand it.

1 Social security is more like a ponzi scheme, where past investors are paid from current and new investor's money.And as far as we can tell, it's mostly sustainable!

6 There is no where near the amount of money you need. If you taxed the top 1% of 100% of their income, you only get ~$700 billion. SS costs >$800 billion now and will balloon to $1.5 trillion by 2024. You can't keep eating the rich to pay for all of your socialism. 
1 Which demographics? If the ratio collapses to 1:1 then every ordinary person would need to give half their income to a retiree
3 Well in New Zealand, the Government suggested raising the retirement age to 67 in 2040 which gives everyone an opportunity to prepare for those extra 2 years. Another solution I'm in favor of is the option to opt out. You pay out all of the earned benefits for people who have contributed their whole lives to the fund, but for people under 40 they can voluntarily take a tax break in exchange for promising not to take a SS check when they hit 65, so they save for their own retirement.Otherwise, it's a road to serfdom.

1 https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/bernie-sanders-deep-south-conservative-222000The attitude Sanders has in this article is exactly why he lost the South. “people say, ‘Why does Iowa go first, why does New Hampshire go first?’ but I think that having so many Southern states go first kind of distorts reality as well.”> I saw him in New Orleans after he had just spent the previous days in TXFunny, because according to Tad Devine, the campaign "didn't compete" in those states.> Devine named eight states where he said the Sanders campaign did not compete with a big presence on the ground or much on-air advertising: Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas.

17 Aleppo is just the clip everyone remembers.  All I have to do is point to his 2012 election run, where he originally ran as a Republican.  He polled so poorly that they excluded him from most of the Republican primary debates until he finally switched over to the Libertarian party and pulled in a whopping 1% of the vote.The ONLY reason he did so well in 2016 was because of the extreme dislike of Trump and Clinton, and he had the most name recognition of the third-party candidates.  While he did gain a lot of steam and was polling double-digits at one point, once he started to get media attention his polling numbers dropped.

1 I love when cult45 use that 2005 doc which Trump leaked to try and make arguments. 
1 when blag pll dont just hh xD
1 Money, really. A lot of Bernie's critics weren't wrong when they pointed out that his math didn't really add up to pay for his college and healthcare proposals, and that's even before you factor in universal pre-k.
1 It doesn't take balls to do that lolI'd have done it
1 He doesn't care that Trump is a liar.  He embraces it.  He loves having a president who is just as much of an asshole as he is.  
1 He's got to go get his opinion handed to him, he will be right back.
1 Not at all. *In my opinion* 80ish percent of things that come up during debates and whatnot should have nothing to do with government or the president. 
1 Who is you guys? They are both fucking weird.
-36 The rest of the quote is even more racism, ya goof Why are you pretending that makes it better?
2 Yeah, because low-income whites in predominantly black neighborhoods *never* have to deal with racism.
-3 Yep poor white people do not have to put up with being given advantages based on the color of their skin.  Those evil racists deserve nothing for being poor and white.
-33 I love when people badly attempt to defend racistsIt gives me the giggles
0 "Bread lines are a good thing."
-20 Being blatantly racist towards about 70% of the country (and 95% of the state he represents) isn't bad enough for you?
1 Your article says Medicare won't be cut? 
1 >The system was rigged in every possible way against himhe is a white male billionaire who inherited millions from his parents.Their was and is literally nothing on earth "rigged against him." He never worked a day in his life and never faced a single obstacle.
1 Perfect. Just too perfect.
3 Being a supposed billionaire and not knowing how to get a goddamned suit that fits you seems to be a good criteria for whether you'll be a good president.
-4 I view more as an inability to do basic grooming, one of the Alzheimer's risk factors. All the clowns running in 2017 looked like absolute fools for various reasons. Almost all are hard to take seriously. From a sun burnt orange weirdo, to a fridgid robot pant suit wearing nonhuman that probably doesn't take a shit without polling to make sure it would be agreeable, and this idiot.

1 Bernie and Trump were not that far apart on 2 very important 2016 issues; immigration and trade. Bernie would have won everything Hillary won in the general plus he would have splintered Trump's support on those issues and that would have been huge especially when he rolls through the rust belt talking about how bad NAFTA was for them. There would have been no pissed off Berners voting Trump out of spite and he would have capture what remains of the OWS crowd  
1 The differences are largely rhetoric.  Substantively they are very similar once they reach Washington.
1 My apologies then,  you are correct. However, I'd rather keep politics out of /Pics and I'd rather not have one post at the top twice.

9 I was thinking more along the lines of  "thinking politicians won't lie is naive" but maybe that's just me. 
4 Depends on whether said populist represents physical humans as people or represents corporations as people, since the populist is "for the people, by the people." It's when "people" has a completely different meaning that makes populism a double-edged sword. We can absolutely cut the taxes of real, breathing people if we shifted the tax liability to the producers, and then offered deductions based on corporations doing things so that the government doesn't have to pick up the slack. You offer low-cost health care coverage to your employees? Great, the government doesn't have to spend much in health care now, so you get a tax break by because you saved the government money AND took care of your employees!
1 So it's okay to lie to the public if your lies are easily reasoned through?
1 You reply to yourself.
1 I don't use Twitter much either, but I think the dude you replied to was explaining why using 1/ or 2/ etc was common when you only had 140 characters to express a thought or opinion. It's probably not so common to use 1/ now that you can use 280 characters per tweet, so when people are talking about it I guess it makes sense to say "it's like that because it used to be like this and that's how people adapted to it" even though they don't have to anymore... But hey what do I know
1 I wasn't entirely sure if the 280 limit was universal yet, but many people also try to keep it to around 140 characters to avoid a soft cut-off that requires selecting the tweet to see the entire text. And it gives a little context to why threading tweets would be necessary to begin with, even if it isn't as necessary nowadays.

1 Obviously you’re not Trump. You’re not lying when you say that. 
1 Knowing how to act the part isn't just for vanity, it's how you get shit done in politics. Politics is in the end run by people, people are vainglorious, not as smart in groups as they are as individuals, and rally around symbolism. Knowing how to use that to your advantage is how effective politicians get things done.

Its a fact.  Get over it.
1 It wouldn't have been quite as much of a problem if the republicans had played ball and let Obama choose a justice. What the fuck was their justification again?
1 And democrats failed Obama by not getting out and voting during the last round of congressional races, allowing the repubs to gain a majority in Congress which would have prevented them from blocking his nomination to fill that seat. Hell, I was deployed in the middle East at the time and still got my vote in. No excuses.
1 > Honestly, I hope the short gamers who didn't vote for Hilary because she was such a bad candidate, I hope they realize that by not getting that Supreme Court seat, it meant we are going to get fucked by corporations until another Republican justice dies or retires which could be 5-10 years. Not to mention if Bader-Gonsburg dies this term.The irony of this mentality is only more absurdly highlighted recently by Republicans and Roy Moore. They'll be saying similar things if Republicans don't vote for Roy Moore and they end up losing a majority because of it next year.It's a pretty good example of how it's a spiraling downward effect where only winning matters, you must look past all the faults of the candidate, hold your nose, and vote for them anyways, because you can't let the other team win. It only makes sense that you eventually get sexual predators and rapists as candidates and they win because of it.
63 While there were most definitely corrupt practices going on in the DNC, I’m pretty sure Bernie unequivocally had fewer votes than Hillary in the end.
42 No, they didn't outright throw out the voting results.  
11 Yep. People keep forgetting about the shit DNC pulled during the elections. I'm not even American but I fucking remember it. In a way, DNC made this whole shit show possible.
1 No.  Millions more Democrats voted for Hillary.  Reddit isn't a all representative of the Democratic electorate.  
1 No, a bunch of people voted for Bernie, and a bunch more people (3 million plus) voted for Hillary.
3 Unfortunately, most Bernie supporters didn't register as Democrats upon birth and thus were unable to vote in the primaries. 
-1 You mean the Democratic National Convention didn’t support the candidate that wasn’t a Democrat?
1 No, Bernie got crushed in a free and fair primary. CRUSHED. 
1 >We need transparency and accountability built into the systemThis will only get built by politicians that care for these things. These are the Unicorns, and Bernie is one of them.
1 That's the problem with so many voters. They nitpick on policies and don't realize how they keep electing shit politicians. You want people for impactful change.Clinton and the DNC love when people like you get caught up in this narrative. It's like when repubs hated on Ron Paul (another honest politician for years) because of his foreign policy.
5 I really doubt they gave him much of a choice, if he hadn't of backed Hillary they would have tried to screw him even harder I bet. I was almost expecting him to mysteriously die before the dems screwed him out of the election.
3 It was a shitty position he was in. He could have either denied Clinton his support and discouraged his supporters from voting for her, thus almost guaranting a Trump presidency, or he could've given her that support and hoped it was enough to swing the vote in her favor. Bernie decided to go the "lesser of two evils" route. He believed he was doing what was best for America, that a corrupt but ultimately moderate candidate was better than four years of a nationalist narcissist who turned out to be just as corrupt as his competition. These things aren't black and white. Politics and progress demand compromise. Otherwise, you're forever trapped in a polarized political landscape with neither side having the support to make any changes. 
8 Triage. He knew he could not win, so he went the shinier of two turds.It's a prime example of why our first past the post election system must be replaced.
8 Should he have backed Trump? The way the idiotic American political system works we had two choices: Clinton or Trump. That's it.
2 Maybe you should do some, because clearly you were just given some talking points and never bothered to look into them.
2 Lol that investigation was already reveled to be a hack job.
1 >Do your research before you talk out your assThe irony... Unless you actually have sources?
1 You're a moron if you think he owns a rolls royce.  He owns two modest homes not a fucking mega mansion and one of those was paid for with money from selling a place left to tge by his wife's parents.  How many homes do Trump and Hillary have?  How much are they per square foot compared to Bernie's homes? One can have a few things while advocating that things should be better for everyone else.  So why don't you do some research before you talk out of your ass?

1 Then why did you not answer my question? 
0 What other way would you have it?Only self funded people get to run?At that point ONLY billionaires would be able to run cause campaigns cost hundreds of millions today. There's a strong correlation to election wins and amount of money spent on said campaign.
1 > Why is this a bad thing?Cause the IRS will throw you in prison for not paying your taxes.
-1 Your idea is basically useless because the more you tighten the controls around the campaign the more you get PACs and other external groups to promote their candidate.Money is seen as an extension of free speech in the U.S. which is why campaign finance is a hard problem to solve
1 Because he's tired of all these fairy tale creatures in HIS swamp.
1 Mate all I did was describe the fact that congresspeople don't just sit around on their ass on the senate/house floor all day, I didn't pull out the sass until you started throwing it at me with your first reply. Clearly you're getting worked up over nothing, so I'm gonna drop this here. Hope you have a good evening. 
1 Well considering you are a liberal you should be used to feeling  mentally challenged
1 > No reason to argue about this.You're assuming we don't *want* to argue about this. This is incorrect. Why would you assume such a thing, considering we are both able to just *not* respond if we did not wish to post.
1 Not unless it goes *sub*-something.

1 You aren’t allowed to be rich, duh. If he really cared about the 99%, he’d give all of his money away. /s
1 Wanting to take my shit.
1 That just tells me that you haven't done any research whatsoever. There is plenty of shit out there on him and the fact that you never even heard of it doesn't mean nobody found it, it is just that Sanders is so irrelevant that nobody even bothers to push the story.
1 He owns three homes. Funny for a politician that’s never held a job in the private sector. But sure, he cares about the poor. 
1 Who is "we"?
1 >he actually believes this
1 This is a Senate race, not a court of law. Trump, and many others, had zero proof Obama was a Kenyan Muslim but that didn’t stop them from making accusations in order to smear him. This guy was banned from a mall for creeping on underage girls and you’re crying about “innocent until proven guilty”? I’m sure you were just as upset by Trump’s accusations about Obama? Right??

0 I put "date" in quotes because that's what he's calling it. So even if you give him the benefit of the doubt and take him at his word, or if you think he should be judged on his professional life, not his personal one, he's still grossly unfit for office.  (I don't give him that or think that, just trying to emphasize how much of a piece of shit he is.)
46 It's incredibly hard to convince even one person who isn't willing to be convinced. Not that you shouldn't try, but challenging somebody's political beliefs is difficult.

2 Convincing republicans to vote for other parties? I guess we all need dreams
3 That kind of talk can get you shunned here and looked down upon.  Source: I work in an old school industry in Alabama and think Trump and Moore are both fucking morons. 
11 Agreed. Am Independent. Question is, will I vote for a party ever again that will back a child molester.
4 That color usually being White.
0 Good point. That is a tough choice.
1 Get the fuck outta here with your logic!
1 You know that the Daily Kos does NOT advocate for jailing people who haven’t been convicted.  Moore should have gone to prison for shitting on the US Constitution.  Which is not a crime but should be.  Also, there are exceptions to the statute of limitations, it’s just that no Alabama DA has the gonads to prosecute anyone who is rich and white.  A sorry state of affairs.
2 Trump tweet! I just skipped the middleman and just did the thing. 
1 Yes, I do. That comment says nothing different.
1 I'm a graduate student, so my taxes may end up being more than a third of my actual income depending on how the House and Senate reconcile the tax bill.My point is that you can't complain about the government running a deficit if you're also pushing for a decrease in federal revenue.

1 Obamacare came after the tea party started getting organized. 401k drainage and banking crisis bailout funds are closer to the genesis.

1 You mean to tell me porn has been lying to me this whole time??
1 What's their response to like... Videos and printed evidence and the politicians repeatedly referring back to the same lies and not even denying them? I don't understand how people can be that much in denial. 
1 What is the lie here?
1 Or Bernie Sanders won the DNC but they are a "private organization" they over-ruled the best option.

1 Fuck yes! "As you Americans say..."
1 False.  Our constitutional republic is a type of democracy.It's like me saying, "Hey look at that car over there".  And you responding, "That's not a car, that's a Ford."Yes, it's a For at a micro level.  But it is still a car on a macro level.
8 There is no more right, USA is literally a Democracy, this is a fact, the fact that USA is a Democracy has nothing to do with whether or not it is also a Republic. The individual who stated that USA is not a Democracy is clearly wrong as it is one.
5 No, they are both right.  They aren't contradictory or mutually exclusive things.  Direct democracies don't exist on the level of the state, whenever anyone says democracy they are not talking about direct democracy.  The person who said that the U.S. isn't a democracy was wrong, though.
3 Just anecdotally when i see that said its by apathetic edge lords who are trying to justify their apathy because its not even a real democracy anyway.
1 That may be a slightly over-dramatic interpretation.

4 The retirement age for anyone born after 1960 is already 67 in America. With average life expectancy at 78 years, should we just ask everyone to work until they die?Also, allowing people to opt-out would guarantee a collapse of the system. The rich, who don't rely on Social Security for their retirement (and whose benefit is usually taxed when they retire), would assuredly opt out and weaken the trust fund for those who need it.
-4 Yeah, I’m not wasting my time having this discussion with you.  You are patently and willfully full of shit and have no interest in any real discussion, just “winning” your internet argument.  I’ve played that game enough not to waste my time and brainpower.  I like to pretend you know you’re spewing crap deep in your heart though!
1 Immigration
1 The problem with your solution is that it doesn't save us from the mass retirement, as the vast majority of those people are over 40. And I can see a lot of people opting out early on and regretting when they're older. Overall there would probably be a lot of people in a bad place.
4 Have you tried to move to Canada? Or even looked into it? It makes getting into the US look like a cake walk. By the time your done the next president will have been elected and likely working towards his reelection
1 I can't even understand what you're trying to say here. Bernie lost the South because he said that region voting first is odd?  Are you also saying that he didn't campaign in the South?  Because he certainly did hold massive rallies all throughout the coastal south. 
1 He held a rally in Birmingham. 
1 Highly doubt there's anyone in that sub who supports Trump, but it's full of bitter Clinton supporters, that's true.
1 >Care to explain how that's worse than regurgitating the circlejerk that the DNC "rigged the primaries"?  lol there's that circular debate stuff I mentioned, cute.  >lol, what? Got any evidence for that claim, or is it just because they (we) don't like Bernie?  Racism, sexism, and anti-semitism have no place in the modern world. You all are on the wrong side of history.See you later! There's too much work to be done saving the planet and making sure our fellow americans from the hurting middle class as well as immigrants, women, and people of the entire spectrum of sexual identity to give the hateful ideologies you people like to dwell in. Have a nice day!

1 So sorry that we want to reduce your taxes and leave you alone.
1 So your argument to my point is to bring up unrelated arguments? I never claimed Trump doesn't pay taxes, you are just evading my point possibly only because you cant dispute it but refuse to accept it because you are so Anti-Bernie or Pro-Trump that anything refuting your beliefs is automatically wrong.Since I can only assume your going to continue to brush off my previous point I want to ask, Whats your opinion of Roy Moore?
1 Are you his accountant? 
1 Lmao. Source plz

19 I don't think you know what racism is.If you're implying that a man who was chained to a black woman protesting segregated schools is a racist, you're wrong. Especially if your evidence is him pointing out the vast difference in experience between being poor and white and being poor and black, and acknowledging that he can't possibly identify with that experience is his "racial blind spot".

1 That is completely irrelevant to the political and social atmosphere engineered for him to fail. YOURE talking about white man monetary privilege. >Never worked a day in his life and never faced a single obstacle This literally describes nobody to have ever existed, ever. But now suddenly the laziest man in the world is running a country. I won't call you delusional, because I think you might believe these things. But, as long as you at least keep your eyes open, your mind will change. 
1 I'm sorry, but Trump would destroy Bernie in an actual campaign. Forget who's better or worse, Bernie is not near as good at campaigning his agenda. I dont think he's ever been successful at moving legislation. The reason Bernie is being hailed right now is because the democrats are trying to save their party. They've taken a lot of damage, and still are. Bernie is the perfect revitalizing persona as far as options go, but this is all within the democratic party. I do believe Bernie had a legitimate chance of winning the primary on a level playing field. Hillary cheated him out of it, then he endorsed her. People won't forget.

1 It is intellectually lazy to push the 'all politicians suck' 'both parties are the same' bullshit.Grow up.  
6 Always.You are responsible for all of your choices and the (reasonably predictable) consequences of those choices.  Voting is a choice with significant ethical consequence and as such requires ethical justification.
1 If that were true, we wouldn't STILL be fighting for Net Neutrality. We have won that fight over and over again 
1 I mean look at the Telecoms! They tried to repeal title two since the day octane about and after trying and trying and trying for so long after everyone else told them they should just give up they are finally succeeding!Shit... That was a lot less inspirational than I intended.
1 Which is why the rich bribe politicians until they get their way. That bill 99% of America was up in arms about. The good news is we stopped it... the bad news, it will get submitted again and again until it passes because that's what the major donors want. It will probably be added to a "must pass" bill an hour before the vote. 
1 Yeah, that was their slogan and it worked..
1 No, you have to victorious enough that you get a supermajority of people in the senate and a majority in the house who would be willing to pass that law.
1 "Try, fail, try again, fail better."
1 implying you can become a president in usa unless you're from a political family or a previous reality tv star.remember, americans went to war to make sure no royal family will rule them, instead political families should rule them.only happens in third world nations and in usa, political dynasties, lol.
1 I appreciate your willingness to learn and I wish there was a way to share this knowledge with one direct link summarizing all of the points and history, but I'm coming up with a blank. From what I believe, politics failed and money won, the banks won, money controls all, consumerism and materialism continue to add jet fuel to the fire. The transfer of power from politics to money occurred in the 70s and it wasn't obvious that it was happening. Noam Chomsky has tons of interviews and lectures on YouTube if you're willing to search, Requiem for the American Dream is worth a watch/read, as is Manufacturing Consent, Ron Paul all the time references it and has his daily news channel on YouTube that he discusses politics on with an egalitarian perspective, Weapons of Mass Instruction by John Gatto references a lot of how to control the mass thought and direction of a society, Adam Curtis documentary HyperNormalisation (Really hard to take in a lot of the information without feeling like a conspiracy theorist but has some good points that fit into the mix). Even someone like Jordan Peterson's perspective on society and money has implications on my beliefs, as he points out it's impossible to funnel money to the lower class, and it's been attempted, but the concentration of wealth will always move towards a Pareto distribution (He uses this word a lot), but there's no reason that money should be so powerful that it eliminates an individuals ground to reality and capability of making an independent decision which effects millions, yet it does, as we continue to witness.
18 The jury is still out in that one. 
16 This assumes that Trump suddenly doesn't want anymore money...which is kind of silly. Trump has spent his entire life trying to accrue wealth. Being rich is something he values bigly and he's always bragging about it. So why on Earth do you think he'd be *less* likely to sell out to the highest bidder? He practically sold his cabinet positions to the highest bidder.
10 Oh really, what about his corporate donors which include many donors from Wall Street (especially Robert Mercer) https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=n00023864This doesn’t even mention what Putin and the Oligarchs allegedly have on him in terms of financial leverage. 
16 >  you can not say about trump is that he is in anyone pockets but his own.lol
20 >  the president is not a life long politician with a careers worth of built up money and favors owed to rich donors#fakenewsThe president owes plenty of favors. What's worse is that it appears he owes favors to foreign adversaries. He has major financial 'deals' throughout the Arab world, China, and Russia. To ensure these deals are profitable for him he has to smooze with regulators and investors to ensure that it's not just Trump money on the line. In light of how his properties fail, how he takes in Russian investment, etc. it's not a leap of faith to assume he owes his pound of flesh.Moreover, the argument that it's better to put the fox in charge of the hen house than to have the fox go through the troubling donating to/bribing the guard dog is ludicrous. 
4 > Good, bad or indifferent one thing you can not say about trump is that he is in anyone pockets but his own.Are you serious? Do you live in Osama bin Laden's cave? Does Russia not have pockets?
1 >Jesus fucking Christ reddit, I stated a fact the man is not life long politician with favors he owes. Its a fact. Get over it.    A subjective opinion is not a fact, then again it's not like Trump supporters know the difference between the two. You literally gave your opinion and created assumptions based off what you have selectively observed. I say selectively because if you actually watched Donald Trump as hard as you could you wouldn't have even bothered with this half baked post that was nothing more than a campaign talking point over a year ago, and has also been repeatedly disproven by Trump's actual actions.    Then your only defense when being proven wrong is to try to wiggle it out based upon his job history, which is literally just your first post reiterated in a slightly different way. Then after again being proven wrong, rather than "holding our politicians accountable" as your post suggests you would side with (after all you don't like typical politicians and I can't blame you), you decided to freak out and blame reddit.  It's always everyone else that's wrong isn't it? You're just like Donald Trump. Everyone else is wrong except you. Any form of self reflection would be too painful or infuriating to handle. At least, that's what I'm deducing based on what I have observed. Something again, you haven't done for Donald Trump. Re-iterating an opinion as "it's a fact" repeatedly doesn't make it a fact.
2 Correct, but consider that Trump may be ignorant and/or foolish enough to easily be swayed into supporting corporations and the like. He's surrounded by politicians who are almost universally lobbied into being corrupt whispering into his ear after all. Also, if he acts at all by personal bias then that bias will aid other 1-percenters such as himself.
1 I think Trump's bad business behavior throughout his life is enough to show that Trump has no pockets but he's fine reaching into others.  So if wealthy folks fund special interest group/politicians.  We didn't really get anything different we just cut out the middleman (politician)  in Trumps case.
5 What are you smoking
2 His pockets are empty, he literally needs donors to survive, what are you on about?
1 Does it really matter? It's still money buying politics, where the money comes from is not really relevant. Trump wanting to establish a better financial situation for himself and better secure his already large bank account is functionally the same as a politician being bought out by other interests. The end result is the same: Legislature in favor of rich interests, and not legislature in favor of what is best for the citizens.I will never understand people thinking Trump is some kind of big stand against money in politics. Are you fucking *high*? All the guy wants to do is ensure that the economic climate is good for his tax bracket.
1 > Good, bad or indifferent one thing you can not say about trump is that he is in anyone pockets but his own.To quote Don Jr:> We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia... Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets
1 I agree, but that isn't the point I was making. Of course it would have been better had they seated Garland, but they didnt. It was up to us to make it happen after at that point, and we failed. I mean, we were close, she won the popular vote, but we failed when it counted. Now it's up us to not let it happen again. 
1 > What the fuck was their justification again?"Because fuck you, that's why."...Or something to that effect, anyway. Goddamn hypocrites.
1 You're wrong. ~~I would vote for a Republican if they promised to get rid of Citizens United too.~~ (EDIT: to better represent my argument) I would vote for an honest pro-life, pro-gun, conservative Republican, if their campaign was to get rid of Citizens United. (I say this, because if we do not, our country will continue to be eaten away at, law-by-law, by crony politicians. We can not get better with the monkeys running the circus)And I'm sorry, it just isn't the same thing. Moore is a credibly accused pedophile, Clinton allegedly did not keep confidentiality concerns as her highest priority (which they should be). One of those is definitely not like the other. 
1 Voters in several locations were turned away because they ran out of ballots. Voters had their party affiliation changed and couldn't vote. Caucuses were a disorganized shitshow. And that's not counting how Hillary got way more support from the DNC and way more media coverage.
1 Yea sure.Because the AP conspired the the DNC to “leak” the “fact” that the superdelegates were all going to vote for Hilary.This leak just “happened” to come right before the last set of primaries, and it caused lots of people who were going to vote for Bernie, to vote for Hilary, because people want to be on the winning team, and people assumed at that point that the nom was going to go to her anyway.
2 6 million fewer
1 Why are you defending the end results of a rigged election?  You have no way of knowing the influence it had over the end results.
0 Source? 
1 Over 3 million fewer. 
1 I’m not.
-5 That is not factual friendo
1 It's a little disturbing to me how many lower-information voters have gotten the impression that Sanders literally had more votes than Clinton in the primary. I've been seeing this particular incorrect belief all over Reddit lately, stuff like "Democratic voters were crying for Bernie and the DNC said no!"Whatever chicanery happened (and it pretty unequivocally happened) to handicap Sanders -- shitty superdelegate nonsense and all -- the voting and vote-tallying was honest, and the person with more votes was nominated.Fuck me, I wonder if we'll still be talking about the 2016 Democratic primary after 2020. No sign of it abating any time soon.
2 They just rigged it. 
1 When SNL was plugging for Hillary, they said something along the lines of "A vote for Bernie is a Trump victory in November."The sad irony...
11 Nobody forgets, they just aren't stupid enough to conflate giving more money to Hillary with stacking the ballot boxes for Hillary. The DNC is a private organization, they're allow to determine how they allocate resources. Should be it fairly apportioned? Of course. That's ideal. But is it a crime against humanity for the DNC to put its resources behind the candidate they think gives them the best chance of winning the presidency? Not really.And at no point did they tamper with the electoral process, which is what you're insinuating happened.
1 This is like one of those cartoons where we were so busy arguing whose fault it was we were lost that we crashed.
1 The idea of open primaries seems to be like accepting cancer to Democrats. God forbid we made it easier for more people to vote. I mean.. dont they talk about that all the time?
1 You mean at death, amirite!!
1 It's a catch 22. We'll never have enough Unicorns. We have to rise up and storm Capitol Hill or something.
1 It was a very shitty position, and he made the safe choice that rewarded known corruption. In the short run, some people don't like Trump; but Bernie had the support at the time to potentially push forward meaningful change for future elections if he had stuck to his guns until actual undeniable proof finally arrived. He did not. He chose to be a tally mark, and so now he's a tally mark.
-3 That is a perfectly logical decision to make, and it's also the safe, easy decision that rewards corruption when it's convenient to his goals -- which makes him no longer different, as I said.
-1 To what? 
1 We can keep going back and forth but, yes I agree these are all problems to work through. The upside is so much better getting public funding than the current system.
1 You are misunderstanding.  Tax dollars pay for the campaigns of the next candidates.  The billionaires have no way of contributing their money directly.
1 Politics is not business it's public service.  We can't take the same approach as business and not expect the negative outcomes of capitalism.
1 There's very much a law of diminishing returns in campaigns.  Figuring out the sweet spot is definitely a little tricky, but so long as a publicly financed candidate can run a real campaign, the big money becomes a lot less important.

1 Wanting to raise taxes on others while owning three houses is indeed selfish, yes. 
1 He probably doesn’t want to take your shit. He wants to take the shit of people who are crazy rich.
1 got any source? if your gonna make claims, you gotta back them up. and before you say it, its not my requirement to google for the proof for your claim. like i can claim, i own 5 houses, and a buggati, and won the lotto tonight, but with nothing to back that claim up, why should you believe me? 
1 The multiple people who asked for a source?
1 So you are just proving baseless accusations happen in politics all the time. Also we have zero proof of him being banned from the mall. Several people said Obama is a Kenyan Muslim so it must be true. That’s what you are saying about Roy Moore. 
96 Cause he’s a member of the Grand Old Pedophiles.
51 Because he's a rich, powerful, republican in Alabama.
22 Magic R
9 Because he's white and religious and lives in the southern United States. I'm not sure where you're from, but the southern United States is generally accepted to be some of the most ignorant people on the planet. As an example, people from Alabama are well aware Moore is a rapist, but since he's also religious and Republican they don't care. You can actually find news clips of people saying they don't care he's a rapist as long as he isn't Democrat. It's just a backwards ass area, you'll only upset yourself if you try to apply logic to anything they do.
1 Beyond statute of limitations.
0 Hey 25k, no questions asked, no fucks given
-7 Because telling a story doesn't mean it happened
21 Political affiliations are the new religions
20 "Don't vote for Roy Moore. He raped a kid, and electing him would be terrible for the party."
7 didn't say it would be easy but if you don't try then eventually the countries fucked and you have to move to another one which won't be easy either.
2 You can lead a horse to water, but if you hold that fucker under, it'll drown before it takes a sip.
2 It’s extremely difficult. When I was growing up I was raised hardcore republican. I live in south Alabama. When the presidential election was happening my dad was visibly pissed when I said I didn’t want to vote for trump, but because he’s my dad and that’s how I grew up I was coerced into voting for him anyway. It’s a shame that I will carry with me for the rest of my life because I probably helped destroy this country. The point of this sorry is that it’s hard to change even when you want to, especially when those around you are telling you you’re wrong. I’m voting for Doug Jones because I agree with most of his stances and Roy Moore is a fucking scumbag at the very least. And for good measure fuck the republicans and their stupid fucking tax bill. 
1 It is indeed very difficult, to remove by logic, an idea that was not placed there by logic in the first place.
11 Don’t convince them to vote D, just not R. Or just convince them *not* to vote.Clinton lost the presidential election because people decided to vote third-party or not show up at all. She failed to convince people to vote *for* her, while the other side convinced people to vote *against* her by voting for anyone else.Convincing a die-hard Republican to vote Libertarian or another third party isn’t easy, but it’s easier than the alternative.
19 You instead re-educate the neutrals, or the never-voted, or the lazy Democrats, why this is important and they need to get out there.
1 I see you've met my grandpa.
1 Shoot, I'm from California ...on a road trip, passed through Alabama and was shunned in a gas station for speaking Spanish on the phone. I'm white. She looked at me like I had just rolled in shit and asked for a hug.
1 I live in a completely idiotic backward 100% republican state filled with total morons, never been represented once in govt in all my 37 years, so I understand the feeling.
11 The thing is, you  don't just not vote for the child molester, you have to actively vote against them.
0 > that will back a child molester.Pretty sure congressional republican leadership keep telling him to drop out.  
1 Trying to find the federal statute regarding "shitting on the constitution"...hm, maybe you could provide a link?  Or is it a state statute?
1 What percentage of our tax dollars do you think go towards waste, fraud and abuse?
1 Bernie's suit seems lighter today than it did last time.
1 You wouldn't know that looking at Trump, he seems willing to do anything to make an extra buck. There's even evidence he stole $ from his sons cancer charity...
1 I can only give you my experience in my family. When I show my family contradictory statements like the ones presented in this thread, they either claim it's fake or tell me, "well that's how all politicians work so get over it."They just don't give a shit cause there is an R next to their name. That's the end of it. Shit, my own father, who raised me on computers and gadgets, is trying to tell me how net neutrality is a bad thing. It's fucking lunacy. 
1 Did you read the thread? User said he showed his in laws this tweet to show how contradictory it is, and they called it fake news. Calling it fake news is the lie, because it's literally a tweet from Trump's official Twitter account. It can't be fake unless someone hacked his account, which hasn't happened. 
1 Both Bernie and Clinton are adults.  Both were better options. 
1 I understand they exist. I just don't believe the amount of legitimate subs that subreddit has is 500k
1 You and me alike. I'm no genius, far from it, in fact, but even my dumb ass could see this raging dumpster fire of a Presidency from 100 miles away, so I did all that I could to try and stop it. Sure, I don't like Clinton, but at least she was prepared and knew how to do the job she was applying for. Nobody can dispute her resume. Especially as a woman, you don't fall ass-backwards into the jobs that she has held in the past. As a woman she probably had to work at least twice as hard as her male counterparts to secure those positions in the first place. I'll say it again, I don't like Hillary Clinton (or sand) but in no way would we be worse off, or even doing as badly if she was President as we are under Trump and his Confederacy of Dunces.   
1 That’s what my dad says, but with the names reversed.
1 No no no. Monopoly! 
1 > We don't need daddy government to overser a goddamn thing.Tell me, what system, besides the government, do we have that allows us to pay into the financial security of our neighbors and friends and family with proper protections of said funds? >The government as it exists now is nowhere close to what the founding documents stated is what they government's role actually is.Agreed, but a government must evolve with changing times and technologies. That's what new amendments and laws are for. If you'd like to change that, go through the proper channels. That's the point of having a government. >No, I don't want the fucking feds running healthcare.Why not?>There's a reason people come to the US when they want care from the best doctorsBut they don't. The US has good doctors, but there are plenty of countries with comparable or even better doctors depending on the field. We're at the top of only a few specific fields at this point, and most of the problem is due to our sacrifice of education in recent years. The doctors of today are comparably worse than the doctors 50 years ago, when put against the rest of the world. >Only one of us wants freedom to live how we choose without half our earnings taken from us to give to someone elseWell that doens't happen in the US. Especially since we choose representatives who picks the taxes we pay, and for what. If you don't like how a representative plans to vote on your behalf, vote to replace them. Crazy concept, I know, but you actually do get to choose how things are run, but so does every other American. 
1 You responded, saying "you are wrong" to someone who said the USA is a democracy.
1 The text offended his delicate sensibilities. 
1 The mind of the left is strange. If it’s about DJT they are against it...even when they agree they’re combative.
1 biased sure, tyrannical i was referring to the donald which he of course visits and bemoans public subs for hating trump, like the majority of the world.
1 Why do you hate democracy?
1 Well it's 65 in New Zealand so raising it over a 20 year period is a tenable solution. No, ordinary people would opt out too. Imagine having all of that retirement money in an investment fund that you control instead of the Government. How much could you make for yourself in 40-50 years? 
4 What? Go look up the numbers yourself!!! There aren't enough rich people to pay for all the things you guys want, there's only about a trillion in the highest bracket. You'll need to raise taxes on ordinary people to pay for all of your goodies. 
1 Wait hold on, I'm liberal but u/GodEmperorOfAotearoa raised a fair point if what he stated is at all true. It's no secret that social security is collapsing. Both parties have run on how they plan to fix it for years now. You stating we should just tax the rich more, as GodEmperorOfAotearoa showed, doesn't come close to fixing the problem even if we take it to the logical extreme (taxing the rich for 100% of what they own). Frankly your response makes it sound like you don't know what you're talking about and you'd rather attack the person than his argument. I'm interested in "real discussion" so please enlighten me. 
1 >Presents argumentI don't have time to use logic and reason, you just want to "win" the argument that I engaged in with you. All your "numbers" are fake news. Bye.t. being this dumb. 
1 Well thats an effective and useful response. Wait, its the opposite. If you cant retort properly it's best you remain silent. 
1 And what happens when the immigrants grow up and get on social security? 
1 The key is getting hired by a good company who provides relocation, and then it's a bit easier. My brother started working for a company in the Toronto area about 4 years ago that did a lot of the optical/photonic manufacturing for BlackBerry. Naturally that company doesn't exist anymore, and he works in NC now, but they paid for relocation etc. and he was moved up there and working in the course of about 3 weeks. 
1 I lived in Canada as a kid, I was very young so I don't know the specifics but if my hippy mom could get me and her up north no problem it can't be that hard. Maybe it was easier years ago.
1 > I can't even understand what you're trying to say here. Bernie lost the South because he said that region voting first is odd?Bernie lost the South because of his dismissive attitude towards it. He claimed that the region was the "most conservative" in the US, which, while technically true, doesn't so much apply to the Democratic primary because most Southern Democrats are black. And while a good chunk of black voters are more socially conservative than other Democratic voters, I'd argue that that isn't really what defined the Democratic primary.  > Are you also saying that he didn't campaign in the South?No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying he ignored it. He didn't seriously contest it. That's why he lost.
1 Tell that to Tad Devine.
1 > Racism, sexism, and anti-semitism have no place in the modern world. You all are on the wrong side of history.So, that's a no, then?> There's too much work to be done saving the planet and making sure our fellow americans from the hurting middle class as well as immigrants, women, and people of the entire spectrum of sexual identity to give the hateful ideologies you people like to dwell in.Letting Trump win is sure a funny way to do that. Bye!
2 I guess that is a possibility. I would have imagined he would have at least heard it by then, but there is a lot going on in the world these days.
12 Aleppo was more than just a city experiencing war...
11 That's the issue, he really didn't have any strong policies.  Pretty much his whole platform was "I'm not Trump or Clinton".  When you actually dig into his policies, some of them were good on paper, but didn't really stand up in practicality.  For example, his consumption tax combined with a reduced national debt quite literally didn't add up, and would have created a massive tax burden on the lower and middle classes.Now, I support some of his policies like cutting back on the War on Drugs and non-military intervention plans.  However, I'm very much a centist-socialist (and have been since before the 'Bern'), so I can't be unbiased getting into Libertarian policy.
4 He's bought and paid for by industry. Private prison, especially, but health insurance and Big Pharma, too.  And the way he implemented policy on behalf of these industries in NM aren't even compatible with Libertarianism. He's pro-free market until he had a vested interest in tipping the scales, and then he hammers his thumb down on that motherfucker.  He's completely inconsistent on foreign policy issues.  All over the map, from trade and the global marketplace to military occupation and diplomacy. He's just clueless.  This is where my perspective should align with Libertarianism, but he doesn't even have the basics down. He's not really better on social issues. He's able to toe the Libertarian line until it contradicts with his biggest donors. Unprincipled hyper-political bullshit he's supposed to be the answer to.  Need more? There's more. If he's there standard bearer for modern Libertarianism, it's really no wonder it doesn't gain traction as a serious third party.

1 Because the initial point obviously went over your head.  Sanders, a literal socialist, pays less taxes both in sum and percentage than someone he had accused of not "doing his fair share" or whatever the hell he said.I understand how tax brackets work, but Sanders still got btfo, a literal socialist that works for the state and virtue signs such as he does she literally be living in a cardboard box and riding nothing but public transportation.  He's a gigantic hypocrite that only wants to share when it's other people's stuff he's sharing.... Just like every single socialist.

1 Politics is a game played only by rich people and for rich people. He was at the Clintons' wedding for god's sake. Let's see you or me get that same coverage or invites."Lazy" isn't the term I would use, but you seem to be incredibly naive about the idle rich upper class. Billionaires lives don't resemble actual people's lives at all. The biggest delusion is people thinking a billionaire reality show star is somehow "blue collar" or "like them."I hope you wake up to the realities of our class system some day.
6 Yeah, I forgot if you don't like the result it's *fake news*The first one is a Harvard-Harris Poll.  If you don't like the source of the second one then check out any fucking poll that has been done since the election.  Bernie always mops the floor with Trump.  But I doubt you'll do a quick internet search to verify that, the only source you seem to trust is your own ass.  
6 This would not have mattered. The Midwest would have just stayed red and firearms were not an issue during the 2016 election. The election came down to 80k people in 3 states with Hillary who was basically pitched as the worst thing ever for gun owners. At worst Bernie performs just as well as Clinton, at best he starts capturing the trade and immigration vote

1 You assume that a large number of people care about ethics.  This is spiritual warfare for a lot of people.  Their ethical argument is that Dems are gays and socialists and are out to literally destroy their way of life.  This is existential for a lot of the hard right religious.  Voting against abortion is *always* the ethical choice from their perspective.

1 First of all, caucuses are not organized by the DNC, they are organized separately in each state. Also, the media coverage of Clinton was not nearly as good as you think it was. Both trump and Clinton had far more negative coverage than positive coverage, and in cases where the Republicans manufactured another stupid scandal, that media coverage meant that more people knew about the "scandal" than knew about Clinton's actual platform. Just the stupid fucking email "scandal" was covered more by the mainstream news than all of the policy proposals from trump and Clinton **combined**.Many journalists assumed that Clinton would be president, so they held nothing back when criticizing her, even going so far as to be duped by manufactured scandals. On the other hand, for most of the campaign trump was not taken seriously, so there was far less negative media coverage, and much of the coverage was neutral/positive. Obviously that changed once he got the nomination and people woke the fuck up, so his media coverage increased and was overwhelmingly negative. Just look at Matt Lauer's pathetic performance during his televised interview/"forum": he attacked Clinton over and over and would not accept most of her answers if he had the tiniest suspicion that she was deflecting, even going so far as to interrupt her several times. But with trump he was much more relaxed and seemed to take trump's answers seriously, even when trump was obviously not giving a real answer. This ludicrous double standard dominated news coverage for months while Clinton was the presumptive nominee and trump was the Republican frontrunner. People in the news media thought it was their duty to heavily scrutinize Clinton because she was more likely to win. Whereas with trump, they treated him with kid gloves or as a punchline, not digging into his vast history of fucking people over and participating in illegal activities until far too late in the campaign. In the end, the legitimate news media helped the shiteaters who disseminate right wing propaganda by attacking Clinton for every perceived fault while ignoring or trivializing the clearly incompetent and malicious trump.
1 > Voters in several locations were turned away because they ran out of ballots. Voters had their party affiliation changed and couldn't vote.These two things are controlled by the individual states.
1 >  the AP conspired the the DNC to “leak” the “fact” that the superdelegates were all going to vote for Hilary.> This leak... caused lots of people who were going to vote for Bernie, to vote for Hilary, because people want to be on the winning teamI wonder. Is that the result, or did more people who would have voted Clinton feel free to vote for Sanders since it wouldn't hurt anything? Did more Sanders' supporters make an effort to get out and vote to make a point? Did more Clinton supporters stay home and not vote as a result?It seems all three of those outcomes are also plausible. Why would you feel more people took the time to vote in a primary and did so for a candidate they felt was less desirable just so they could tell their friends "she was a shoe in, but I was there and I voted for her in the primary." I don't agree with your assessment.
7 That's what happens when you break all sorts of voting laws to cheat your way in. Then Hillary is surprised when nobody wants to vote for her over Trump.

1 It's just people on the other side trying to rally up in-fighting so the left wing destroys itself.
1 How was the vote tallying honest if they had to play dirty to get it? That's like saying "Well, math doesn't lie." It never did, but you made sure it got added up the way you wanted. 
1 According to Bernie, there was no chicanery. 
1 > uck me, I wonder if we'll still be talking about the 2016 Democratic primary after 2020. No sign of it abating any time soon.Nah. We even stopped talking about the 2000 election cycle eventually. Everything comes to an end... even hanging and dimpled chads.
1 I mean, sometimes my political-discourse buddy and I still talk about the what-if about McCain running with Palin. Had it been almost literally anyone else, there is a slight chance we wouldn't have had Obama for 8 years.We run out of stuff to talk about, there's only so much Trump-discourse we can have before we have to take a break.
1 Your comment is the first time I've heard it mentioned in probably 5-6 months. 
1 > shitty superdelegate nonsense and allYou mean currently elected officials endorsing a candidate? That would have happened whether they were superdelegates or not. 
1 > the voting and vote-tallying was honestheh heh.....no
1 > It's a little disturbing to me how many lower-information voters have gotten the impression that Sanders literally had more votes than Clinton in the primary.They are almost as out of touch as the DNC is with its own voter base is right now. The next election hinges on them pulling their heads out of their own asses and listening to voters. 
1 Yeah, the DNC should have done the undemocratic thing and had the superdelegates vote for the guy who got less votes /s
1 Well she IS the Democrat.. /s
1 They gave her the debate questions BEFORE THE FUCKING DEBATE. I'm a democrat and I would consider that tampering with the electoral process, they didn't enlist a hostile foreign power to do so and they didn't do it in the general election, but they did tamper with the election process nonetheless.
1 They absolutely did.They conspired with the Associated press, right before the final set of primaries. They “leaked” the information that the superdelegates were going to vote for Hilary, causing all the swing voters and people who “want to be on the winning team” to vote for Hilary instead of Bernie.This is why he lost those primaries, when he had a HUGE lead in the days leading up to them.
4 I have news for you... Bernie probably would've won!  Hillary was a horribly tainted nominee.
1 No, it's not a crime, but it should be.
1 Kinda like when Sanders supporters advocate for caucuses.
1 In the short run, we may cause enough damage to the environment that it is literally irreversible. We are already seeing feedback loops as far as global warming goes. Four years of a president that is actively making the situation worse instead of even maintaining could be too late. In the short run, people relying on social programs to live are going to see a drastic reduction in their quality of life. People will die, from suicide or lack of medical attention. In the short run, we put our economy in jeopardy, risking a worse economic collapse than the great depression. Jobs will be lost, families will lose homes, even the basics needed to survive. And again, people will die. Because of suicide, starvation, lack of medical care, etc. IMO, we had problems that couldn't afford four years of getting significantly worse. And now they are. Bernie's gamble didn't pay off, but he made the same choice I would have because he believes what I do: that our problems are too severe to play the long game and hope for a better future in four years. 
1 I feel that his decision was honest because he had what he saw as America's best interests at heart (status queue over reactionism in the short term). I disagree with its fundamentals perhaps, but I also believe that it isn't what was best for his goals as Clinton winning would essentially erase all of the progressive movement's progress, but with Trump in power and a neoliberal loss he still has a now very real chance at getting himself or another progressive in the White House in 2020. So in my eyes he at the time set his own potential aside to do what he felt was right.Sanders is far from perfect, but he's still the only politician I know that I would personally call honest and full of integrity without a doubt.

1 I'm not sure what you mean. Politics is in business and public service except the issues are different. And unless you outlaw spending money how you want and outlaw free speech you're not going to solve them in promoting candidates or issues
1 public financing does nothing to stop pacs or other organizations from spending money to promote their ideas or candidate

6 Coming from the south I want to hate you so much for saying this, but I also feel you're right. After 30 years of slamming my head against a wall with most of the people here I've realized it's better if I left because they aren't going to change and things wont get better,  at least for one more generation.
-1 Try and not be too impartial. Here here!
9 The extreme right pandered to the extreme christians (Evangelicals) and now they're in control of the party and they equate being conservative with being a "good Christian".
23 "Accusations are made up by the liberal media, and Jones supports full term baby murder; Moore is defending our violated Christian rights, and even if he did go after teens, times were different back them so it's okay."These are the comments you'll run into by people of my state who are wholly invested in the Moore campaign.
1 I agree with you, but for fun, I'm going to play devil's advocate (I live in Alabama, and have heard all the excuses).Do you have any proof he raped a kid? Why isn't he in jail? Just a bunch of Hollywood bigwigs trying to tell us how to vote. Innocent until proven guilty. Moore is innocent.Once again, I'm a Jones supporter- please don't read half the comment and rage.
1 If they're voting Republican, I doubt they would see these things as negative traits.
-11 That didn't stop blue haired sjws from saying "I'm with her!" 
1 Clinton didn't lose because of third party voters. She assumed she would automatically get the votes of everyone who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, so she didn't even try. The Democrats made the fatal error of not taking Trump seriously, and it lost them the election.
1 I'm retaining my Independent voter status. Fuck the bipartisan system. Y'all can deal with my not "picking a side," and that's all there is to it. Some of us believe in social liberalism and fiscal conservatism. 
0 "Re-educate""Indoctrination"Choose one, choose wisely. Oh wait, they're both the same and you're both discussing matters that are entirely destructive in their possible impactYou speak of political affiliation as though humans are creatures of reason. We are creatures of emotion, we vote according to our temperament, the idea behind the American system was to decentralize power away from the federal so that places like California could exist alongside Texas without war. The right strongly holds Texan values and California strongly upholds left values, the two were meant to exist independent of the other, allowing many United Nations under one United banner, this system we have now? It's a shamble of what it once was, once represented. Political power did not wild such a massive mace as it does today.If you explained income taxes to your forefathers, they would ask what the difference between that and the monarch they fled from was. But you bring it up in any sort of seriousness in public dialogue, you get laughed out by the fools who think they know politics because they vote.
1 "Grandpa he literally fucks children! You can't vote for him!" "You expect me to vote for the communists? At least those children grew up, can you imagine if women had the right to abort them? Better fucked than dead is what I always say."
6 If enough people voted for a 3rd party candidate then the 3rd party candidate would win. Most people see this the way you describe it (as a binary choice) voting against and some choose to just not vote because they don't like either candidate. The two party system is a an embarrassment. 
4 Nope. The RNC reinstated their support for him yesterday, as well as trump. So, the opposite. 
1 Just because it's not a law doesn't make it right. There are plenty of things that have been made laws after someone did them and got sent to jail.  It happens. That's what the court system is for  
1 How is it contradictory?He hasn't cut any of those things.Claiming he has is a lie.
1 Yes Bernie is an adult, Clinton was a terrible choice and would be more the same bullshit politics.
1 My first thought was "well, it may *say* 500k, but really, how many of those are bot accounts?"
1 At least your dad recognized that Trump was a bad candidate. Hopefully he is happier with the outcome now than I am.
1 At least Obama's platform wasn't "revert anything Bush did".
1 Mob rule has never been a good or effective thing. 
1 The fact that ordinary people would opt out strengthens my point - the system would collapse without contributions. In any case, additional taxation is a tenable solution as well, isn't it?
1 Honestly it doesn't matter how many rich or poor people live in a country or the tax rate they pay. If people feel used and under appreciated and they have the means, they either leave or find ways to fight back. For the current tax situation fighting back is lobbying for loop holes and offshore bank accounts.But hey reforming the system we have to work is just so gosh darn mean and like lots of hard work and decisions.
1 A better funded social security
1 Maybe he should read [this](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/01/bernie_sanders_making_first_al.html).
1 See what I mean about circular 2016 debate, fellow readers?  In solidarity, against hate and towards a future free from the establishment greed and corruption that have caused this mess. Happy holidays
1 Is it great that he didn’t know?  No.  Is the goof anywhere on the order of magnitudes as bad as our other two choices?  Also no.  Having a depth of off-hand knowledge on current events is less important than your ability to think and reason.  It’s like if I were to hire an RN for my practice, do I care if she has memorized every piece of information available, or I care if she can think, reason, problem solve, and does she have a good heart?
1 I am sorry but by any metric, if we were going to base these people based on merit, Johnson should have blown Trump out of the water.  You can make a case that he couldn't win against a candidate like Hillary on merit, but Trump? I don't feel a bit of sincerity when I talk to anyone who uses one or two political gaffes as a reason to vote for Trump over Johnson.It's all about defensive voting in a single issue voting world.  The shaming of third party voting was and continues to be extremely strong in this country.  It's lazy and I don't accept many criticisms of Johnson when people don't put it in context to what the other choices were in 2016.
1 Well you proved me right, instead of addressing either comment you tried to, what, shame me for not proofreading?
1 Well you keep hating Sanders, who even if he had won Socialism would not have over taken America but a positive influence would have helped struggling programs  such as school and police, while we watch Trump try to destroy the affordable care act and fuck the lower class with his new tax bill.
1 I read “trump paid more in taxes than Obama and Sanders.” Did not include the amounts they’re actually paying which leads me to believe you read everything and take it for fact without proof. 
16 First of all, that's not the quote. The quote as you just wrote is inaccurate, and if it were given in the context of the original quote wouldn't make any sense.Second of all, it was in the context of a question about what part of a minority's experience can you not identify with.Third, Trump doesn't have a history of standing up for poor minorities... In fact, it's the opposite. 
5 Yes. are you purposely dense or do you not think wording matters?
1 Ever heard of institutional racism?
2 How you get that from the full quote is beyond me. And no its not institutional racism. I don't think you know what that term means.
1 Another idiot.... Congrats to you too!!!
1 Money is the only way to successfully run a campaign. And until our fractional reserve banking system is completely overhauled, there's really nothing we can do about it. >you seem to be incredibly naive about the idle rich upper class>a billionaire reality show star is somehow "blue collar" or "like them"The only possible implication that I follow this line of thinking is the fact that you said I did. If only saying things made them true. Good luck with your magic tricks. 
1 This one's quick acting; this one's long lasting.
1 Tis a reason for the Treason Season....

1 Let's do some math then.If you're in the 1,000,000$ range, to get that amount in your bank, you are taxed at a rate of 39.60% for every dollar you earn over 418,000 on top of paying out 121,505.25$So right out the gates, if you earn 418k, you have 296,494 dollars to your name in your bank.If you earned a million dollars, your bank account would swell...all the way up to 525802.So how much do we need to earn to round out that last 500k? Almost an entire million. Because 40 cents of every dollar goes to the state.You want to know why tax cuts incredibly affect the rich instead of the poor? Now you know.

1 One cab speculate, but that's irrelevant now and all that matters is what happens in 2018 and 2020.
1 Ah, no need to defend your statement in true r/the_donald fashion.
1 Explain how
1 So you admit that they ethically defend their votes (even if their ethical defense is reprehensible).
1 Except the problem is that Democrats in general don't advocate for abortion, they advocate for a woman's right to choose.Sort of like taking responsibility for your own actions instead of making the Feds responsible for you.Pro choice /= baby eating child killers. The problem is that the right is generally too uneducated and too brainwashed by the conservative controlled media to understand the huge difference.
1 I don't assume a large number of people care about ethics.I'd argue they have an obligation to care that they are failing to realize and failing to meet.  Unfortunately, religion is a stand-in for ethics for many people and they lack the privilege of a proper education in ethics.  >Their ethical argument is that Dems are gays and socialists and are out to literally destroy their way of life.That's not an argument...ethical or otherwise.  It's an assertion/statement/claim but it isn't itself an argument.  Our education system simply has failed them and failed to teach people how to critically think and examine arguments and evidence.  >This is existential for a lot of the hard right religious.It certainly is existential for the hard right religious groups, they've been losing ground for decades and progress marches on.   Tradition and a 'way of life' is not self-justifying, bigotry and prejudice as an element of a culture is not exempt from criticism.  A culture which dehumanizes the Other to such extremes that nativism finds a grasp in the 21st century is certainly a culture that will be bent until it breaks as the tides of demographic change and societal growth won't stop at their request.  >Voting against abortion is always the ethical choice from their perspective.I wasn't aware abortion was on the ballot.  But yes, dogmatism is flawed and dangerous.  Fundamentally though, all of these issues harken back to education.  People opt for easy, simple answers that let them blame someone else for the problems they face and without the benefit of a quality education they don't even recognize the flaws in their approach.  
1 The UK is doing a perfectly good job of gutting their medical system and selling it off to the highest bidder.
1 He refused to release his tax records, so you can't know that.
1 Right like you have to be a politician to accrue favors owed. What about the politicians that helped him get his casinos approved/secured him business incentives/the Florida AG that dropped the Trump university case. Just because one isn’t a politician doesn’t mean they are politically clean.
1 Right, he's a corrupt businessman with a career's worth of favors to pay back. It's just like being a politician, except with no experience in governing or expertise in policy.
1 The polls leading up to the primary all showed Bernie with a strong lead. Until that leak. He then lost badly.You might have a different assessment, but that’s my own analysis.
9 Well, 3 million people more than for trump, voted for her
1 This is what some people actually believe, jesus...
1 No, there were no voting laws broken in her favor. That's bullshit fake news that even Bernie said was bullshit. get your head out of your ass
1 Holy shit yes. Liberals in this country, more than ever before in my lifetime, need to be unified in the face of this shit-avalanche.Petty squabbling over shit like this only serves to divide us and sap our enthusiasm. Yeah, the nomination was always intended for Hillary. That we even came close to upsetting that assumption should give us reason to be proud; but now that that's in the past, we need put our internal arguments aside and focus on taking back the House and the Senate. We can bicker about Bernie vs. Hillary later, people. Now's not the time. Let's get out there and vote for every motherfucking Democrat from the Senate on down to the fucking dog-catchers. 
1 Well, destroying itself via infighting *is* what the American left does best.
1 no obama probably means no trump though. that's a fair trade off IMO.
1 Caucuses aren't democratic and there are tons of those. 
1 That's not tampering in the electoral process. Debates are not part of the electoral process. They're privately run events, and don't use any public funds to put them on. The electoral process consists of voting booths, ballot machines, tallying software, the electors themselves. The DNC didn't tamper with the electoral process. It gave Hillary a heads up as to debate questions ahead of a privately sponsored debate. Again, not exactly a crime against humanity. It's not like knowing these questions ahead of time offers any huge advantage anyway. The questions are never the type of "gotcha" questions that would provide an advantage if you knew about them ahead of time. Oh they asked Hillary about Benghazi? Wow I'm sure she never would've prepared for that! Get over it. It's not that big of a deal.
1 > They “leaked” the information that the superdelegates were going to vote for Hilary, causing all the swing voters and people who “want to be on the winning team” to vote for Hilary instead of Bernie.I'm pretty sure the media had been reporting for months that Superdelegates were going to vote for Hillary. And it.. wasn't exactly a surprise.
1 I was a Bernie supporter, it might have been closer but the GOP would've used Russia to dig up some fake dirt on Bernie the same way they did Hillary. They would've turned people against him all the same. Let's stop acting like Bernie was a cure-all for the cancer that infected our electoral system in 2016. 
1 Why should it be? Do you disagree with the founding fathers' notion that the uneducated masses can't be 100% trusted with full sovereign power?
1 I have no idea what that means, I have no idea where you’re from. 
1 Politics is meant to represent the interests of the people and not the interests of the entity with the largest bag of cash.Yes at the core here I want to outlaw those seeking public office from being able draw from private funds in order to promote their campaigns.  Meaning company X can't separately run an ad campaign independent of the candidate's apparent wishes that promotes that candidate.
1 All of that space can easily be made up by decreasing defense spending.
1 It’s a statement, phrased as a question, because you literally have used this reply on two people, so to not understand what “we” means is insane. You are not engaging in conversation in an intellectually. You’ve attempted to change the conversation from your lack of sources to my word choice. Please provide a reasonable source to back up the claim that the DNC paid Bernie Sanders off.
1 And I do understand that not all of the people in the South are like this; you guys are just so overwhelmed with the ignorant people that the rational voices might as well be non-existent. It is good to know the voices do exist though!
1 That's pretty damn ironic considering this is r/pics and it's been super political and far left. 
1 Hmm sounds like the Catholics and Europeans about 400 years ago
1 Which has absolutely nothing to do with Jesus.
3 It's like when old ass construction workers told me that racism "was just a different belief from a different time." Yeah, a time of idiocy.Had one prick tell me that we needed to take down all MLK statues because "he was against homosexuality," but somehow taking the Confederate statues down was "completely un-American and not right, because racism was just a different era from political correctness." 
1 "Did YOU rape any kids thirty years ago? Was that a thing you thought you could do, thirty years ago, and you just decided not to? Because, I think you had the good sense not to grab a teenager by the neck and try to force your dick in her mouth when you were 30, and I don't think you would have thought that was okay thirty years ago."
1 Times were different back then.  Legal marriage age in Alabama was 14 at that time...
1 "I do have proof he raped a kid, but he isn't in jail because he kept it in his Alabama town. He was the DA, and you know what it's like going up against a man like that - we all do. Imagine trying to do that when you're a 16-year-old girl. Hey, like you said, it was different times, and it was that much harder for her then."
1 Not a social justice warrior, and I haven't had dyed hair since I was a young teen, but I still voted for HRC because I couldn't see myself voting for Trump. Y'all need to fucking relax. Focus on what's actually important, yeah? 
1 She didn't rape a kid, and there never was anything to the emails. In fact, there's so fucking little dirt on that woman that Republicans are still in the "promise to do something towards creating an investigation" phase of trying to score political points. If they had anything better than that, someone would have been able to reveal it by now.
1 Then all you can do is vote for the candidate that comes the closest to exemplifying that.I don't disagree, completely get where you're coming from, but sometimes you have to get off the fence, for yourself, family, community, state and country.  Ya gotta make a stand, and stand together.
1 I would disagree.  Re-education implies freedom of choice after the process is complete.  Indoctrination does not.I do like ourt comment, and will upvote.  But I also believe, because not American, that 'rugged individualism' and the drive from, if not centralisation of power, then cetralisation of knowledge, is acting to your detriment right now.And taxes are a necessary evil, and can be good if used right.  Very few countries in the last 50 years have done so.
2 It will never happen. Electoral college basically nullifies any votes they would have is distributed across the state. Everyone I know says without the EC we would have mob rule. We have that anyway, and look where it's gotten us.Edit: On local levels it's being afraid to waste your vote, so you vote for one of the two establishesd parties. It is no longer about who you like, just who you hate less.
1 I don't entirely disagree with you, the problem with 3 choices is, instead of potentially nearly half the electorate dissatisfied, you potentially have nearly 2/3 of the electorate dissatisfied.  For it to really work, the winner would have to win resoundingly well.
1 The tax bill that the Republicans are trying to get signed into law includes cuts to some of these programs, if not all. I'm not going to break it down for you, go read articles on the topic from anywhere but a republican backed news source. 
1 Great argument. Kudos. Obama’s platform divided the country like no other time since I’ve been alive. His “accomplishments” are definitely revertable
1 Yes taxation is a solution but it'll have to be a substantial increase on everyone. [I think a mixed approach is better, Forbes has a good list of suggestions.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2016/06/09/social-security-insolvency-when-and-what-to-do/#5eac06bb2c51)
1 It depends on how our economy develops in the future, really. If cost of living continues to rise while paychecks stay the same (which has been the trend for quite a while now), raising taxes would absolutely not be a good solution. 
1 With whose money!? You're not very good at this
1 Hey, I totally agree with you. I think that everyone had their stupid moments during the election. It's just that the presidency seemed to require this unobtainable perfection that most other jobs do not require. However, I will admit that this requirement might not really mean much after what has transpired...
1 LOL.  Now you're all confused.  What "either comment" are you talking about?  All you said to me was "terrible spelling" so I returned the critiquing back to you....which wasn't very difficult haha.  Shame shame for not proofreading, right?Anyhow, enjoy your keyboard warrior fun. 
1 Uh huh.  Anyways, the taxes that Sanders pays are legal minimums.  He is completely and totally free to give more.  He does not while at the same time saying everyone else needs to.We haven't even gone into the fact that he's a net tax receiver bitching about what private sector earners pay... 
1 Uh huh.  What I'm lead to believe is that you are scared to even Google it, despite this entire thing being public record as Maddow outlined the entire thing during her program, something reddit was literally foaming at the mouth waiting for. Lol I wouldn't be surprised if you watched the segment on Maddow and now just run around like a crazy person saying it never happened.Literally hundreds of articles on it, countless videos on YouTube... And yet, here you are... Saying it's not true.http://thehill.com/policy/finance/domestic-taxes/324123-rand-paul-slams-sanderss-tax-rateTrump pays a higher percentage of taxes than socialist Sanders.  That should tell you everything you'll ever need to know about Sanders. 
1 http://thehill.com/policy/finance/domestic-taxes/324123-rand-paul-slams-sanderss-tax-rate>Trump paid a 25.3 percent tax rate in 2005, according to Fox News. Sanders paid a 13.5 percent rate in his 2014 taxes, and President Obama paid 18.7 percent in 2015.
-3 Pretty obvious what it means. And I think it's pretty obvious my comment applies. Other whites reading this know too. You're only allowed to cry out if you're not white. If you're white your problems don't exist. That shit is going to end. This I promise you.

1 Sure, everyone has to justify their choices to themselves.  However, you can make a code of ethics out of damn near anything.  Even personal advancement at the expense of all others.  Hell, for a lot of people simply *not being a Democrat* is an ethical argument for voting for a particular candidate.  I know a few grumpy old men that justify their votes with a simple "fuck liberals".
1 >Except the problem is that Democrats in general don't advocate for abortion, they advocate for a woman's right to choose.That's not the way it's portrayed by evangelical preachers on Sundays.
1 How do you fix education when the people who win elections win because of a poor education system?  It's a catch-22.
1 they'll swing left again, and the left will spend most of its time fixing everything the conservative administration destroyed, funnily enough, the current administration used the NHS as a method of attacking brexit, which was absolute bullshit, but meh. Im saying that, yes, it will be under attack, but it will be TOO POPULAR for them to outright get rid of it without significant political backlash
1 I love it when my country is pointed to as a shining example... wait
1 As is Sweden, although not as quickly and aggressively.Seems like it's pretty much the same late-stage capitalism game of chicken everywhere to varying degrees.
1 And because she didn't go to Wisconsin and hid in her house in Chappaqua for the last three months of the campaign, she still lost
1 I'm surprised either party hasn't imploded at this point. 
1 Guess who did better in the caucuses (hint: Bernie)
1 Wow your willingness to defend this conflict of interest is astounding.  Is it all okay as long it means more Dems get voted in than Republicans because that is the same dumpster logic conservatives eat up daily too.
1 Bernie has an incredible track record.  Hillary has one of the worst most conflicted history.  These two are not the same.  Complete lies vs half truths look very different to voters.  DNC would love you to believe Bernie would have lost.... and that's the reason why you're hearing this rationale...
1 I really don't think so.
1 Some say Bernie went to Russia on vacation, and never came back!
1 It stands for "sexually transmitted victory".  Whoever has the most sex in a 24- hour period wins! 
1 Here is here.STV is one of the many other systems besides FPTP.
1 > Yes at the core here I want to outlaw those seeking public office from being able draw from private funds in order to promote their campaigns.You're saying it should be illegal for me to spend $100 of my own money printing flyers to hand out to promote myself in an election
1 Oh cool so our country is now defenseless from a military standpoint but at least we can enjoy our death panels?  And if you want to be ideologically consistent, why not cut both forms of socialism instead of stopping with the military?   
1 Where's your proof? All I've seen is a few fake signatures the libs refuse to turn over for analysis. ~once again, read my above comment, I'm playing devil's advocate, fuck Moore
1 Yeah we are focusing on what's important like stopping iran getting nukes, and stopping pedophiles in the government. Y'all just want people's money. 
1 Um yeah uranium 1 but you wouldn't hear it on the Clinton news network.Nothing in the emails? All of her donors are involved in corruption. Harvey Weinstein was in there sending her film clips and she loved his money. There's also the whole blatantly satanic "spirit cooking" that's a fact. They don't even deny it as real. And oh yeah, there's an email about them using uber to get 3 kids "for entertainment in the hot tub"But you know, Trump fed those koi fish wrong. That's what we should be talking about /s
1 > Re-education implies freedom of choice after the process is complete... Ok.
1 1) If it's not passed yet, he didn't cut anything.2) The user said he talked to his in-laws in the past.>I'm not going to break it down for youIE: I just got caught in a lie.
1 You've been spouting bullshit, can't expect me to give any meaningful comment in return.
1 People paying into social security. Keep up.
1 Oh im sorry I hurt your feelings so bad that you felt the need to come to my page and read through my comments. Well the difference between you and I are that I dont really care about my bad grammar and you just look petty.I mean I just came across your comment while reading the lowest rated comments on a post you went out of you way to look for mine so enjoy your petty fun.
1 Well I'm not even gonna acknowledge your comment because you refuse to address mine I will just give you an elegant "Uh huh" in response.
1 He's going to say something about the years being different. Then you're going to post the same article I did that says "Bernie has only ever released his returns from 2014". Then you won't be replied to.
1 Lol. 2014 and 2015... and then u got Trumps tax returns from 12 years ago. XD literally can’t make this shit up..
1 I have also mastered the snarky comment at the end starting with "good luck with" to troll the other person into responding emotionally. Good luck with your thumb up your ass and don't forget to feed your ego.teehee

1 So pretty much what we have right now TBH fam
1 Lost because of the undemocratic system of the us. Hid because she was ill.
1 Guess even caucuses can't overcome a rigged race. 
1 Hillary was the most competent candidate in the history of the USA, the notion that Bernie would have won is a Russia Today meme.>Complete lies vs half truths look very different to voters. Is that why your President is Trump?
1 Cognitive dissonance. That's all you're engaging in right now. There's no reason for you to think Russia wouldn't have attacked Bernie with the same ferocity and effectiveness that they attacked Hillary with. If you think they wouldn't have done that, you're thinking with your emotions and not your logic. Do better.
1 Yea the playing field is immediately unlevel if you are able to.  This is the age of the internet.  Why do you think publicly shared discourse would be so hard to create and use.  Do you really prefer the media to be left promoting the same candidates your party promotes because it's all bought by the same billionaires?
1 Death panels aren’t real. Most of our defense spending is overkill.You are not arguing in good faith, and if you will not do so, I’m done.
1 "The Republicans used to be the morally upstanding party, and now Democratic senators are doing the right thing and stepping down or apologizing. If the Republicans can't be as moral as the Democrats, how can the party stand for what's right anymore? And if Alabama Republicans elect a child rapist, even if you don't know for sure whether he is right now, if this evidence proves he's a rapist, then the party's going to be the party of rapists, not the party that stands up for our children."
1 "Stopping pedophiles in government" Yeah that's why y'all are voting one into office in Alabama. 
1 "that's a fact. They don't even deny it as real."Uh, check again? That's only a verifiable fact if you take Fox&Friends' made-up facts as verification. Like, goddamn, it was an email from Marina Abramovic to Tony Podesta, that he forwarded to his brother to invite him to dinner, and the idea that Hillary Clinton is a satanist because John Podesta's brother invited him to dinner with a performance artist is really, really dumb. No one would ever deny that email happened because for anyone but a crank that wouldn't even register as remotely meaningful.But yes, trivialize attacks on Trump by making up some conspiracy bullshit about Hillary and then somehow ignore that Trump is a sexual predator with quite a few documented cases of harassment and assault and pretend like dumping a box full of fish food into a pond of fish is the worst thing he's ever done, that'll make me take you seriously.
1 Spirit cooking was something done by an artist and her 'cook books' were never supposed to actually be used. That's why there are so few of them. In museums....because it's art. Her actual dinner was a normal dinner. Btw the actual satanic church is pretty much an atheist dig. They don't worship anything, except maybe body autonomy.  So I don't see how it would be 'satanic' anyway. 
1 Oh, I know in sometimes this is not the case!  But... in  a better world, the re-educated are offered options, not single choices.
1 Ok mr bot.
1 FFS there aren't enough people paying into the program compared with people who are taking from it. The ratio is approaching 1:1. There might be more people in retirement than workers in the next few decades. 
1 It's the only year [he's ever released.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/06/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-has-released-few-tax-returns-compar/)......But keep moving the goalposts. 
1 I guess the guy with less votes should get more votes next time
1 "He just wasn't that involved." -- Michael Barr (U.S. Treasury), on the substance of Bernie Sanders' involvement in financial reform
1 Totally. They probably would have trumped up some fake dossier about Bernie peeing on women in Russia or something. That would have lost him the election.
1 That's not what cognitive dissonance means..
1 How do you think the playing field is when the only knowledge of all the candidates are based on word of mouth?Even your internet example doesn't make sense in that world because an internet connection costs money.
1 So aggressive.Chelsea Clinton is friends with her, and this all happened in group emails. She has been at democrat fund raisers.Also, how do you say "it's only real if you listen to Fox news! But it's real cuz it was sent to tony podesta!" What's the point of saying it's fake then say it's real? Your mind has "knee" jerk reactions. Take the red pill. 
1 In a better world, yes. But in reality, I'm afraid this is where you and I will have to respectfully agree to disagree lest it come to blows. The truth is, we're all human, we're all fallible and most of us simply refuse to accept that reality. We do not exist in an idealized universe, existence itself means we will inevitably die one day. To attempt to use the metric of perfection spits in the face of good enough. That, I'm afraid, is where my contention with the amorphous movement known as "The left" comes from. This bizarrely childish notion that we could, one day, exist in a utopia. Completely ignorant of the fact that what is perfect for you, may very well be hell for me.
8820 Hey guys|girls,This is me. It's a bit weird (and off-topic) to see me on /r/europe.Ask me anything, I guess.PS: I did not create VLC. I joined the Ecole Centrale Paris in 2003, and I've been leading the project since 2007. I created the VideoLAN non-profit though :)PPS: not my best photoEDIT: obligatory "thanks for the gold edit.
4302 Rather than wondering how we can make more people built privacy breaking, data monetising, tax evading giants like Facebook, maybe we should be wondering how we can support people like him.
253 ping u/jbkempf
459 Just the other day I opened VLC and was like "The volume on this goes *over* 100.  I love VLC."Thanks, Jean-Baptiste.  
968 Btw, the name is an acronym from Very Large Cone. I know that there are people trying to push other versions but don't let them fool you. This picture clearly shows the truth.
112 Goddamn what a champion. I bet you the majority of people will sell out as soon that amount was offered. 
173 His first name is Jean-Baptiste, it's a double-barrelled firstname.
48 VLC BAISE OUAIS.
47 I’m immediately going to VLC’s website and will donate what I can to the project led by Jean. I hope there are tens of millions of people who do the the same (even if a million users just donate €1, it is a win). Thanks Jean.
87 He did an AMA on r/France not too  long ago.   He is just as awesome as he looks in this picture.   [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/)'s the link for those who are interested and can understand french. 
108 I love his hat.
35 If you use VLC you should go to their site and donate if you can. I've been using this thing for probably a decade, and they deserve my money at least.
27 Massive respect!
27 He's a Hero, he saved me from Windows Media player!
26 VLC is the best media player ever. You could throw anything at that program and it's going to play no problem. I once even used VLC player to play the Recycle Bin.
21 [He did an AMA a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/)
16 Huh. I was wondering why this looked familiar: I took that photo in Berlin, during the QtCon 2016.Good to see u/jbkempf  and [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) getting some love outside the Free Software bubble. I had the opportunity of talking to him live and he told me how they have to fight off patent trolls and aggressive copyright lawyers all the time. He also told me a fun story about the beginning of the project.[We made a transcript and posted it here](http://www.ocsmag.com/2015/07/17/vlc-an-interview-with-jean-baptiste-kempf/).
15 Merci beaucoup, Jean!
13 I always wonder how VLC makes money.
12 Definitely more likeable than Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.
12 The real MVP.
13 The First thing i do after installing a fresh copy of windows is set VLC as my defualt player. runs everything i throw at it.
10 Dzięki, Jean!
10 VLC always gets an upvote from me
11 My favorite video player of all times.
26 A real hero. 
7 Been using VLC for years because it can even play some corrupted files. Worthy a donation: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html
9 This mans morals must be very high because I would sell out without hesitation for a few million
15 This man is god !
6 A while back, I torrented a couple porn movies that have become my favorite porns of all time. When I downloaded them, they weren't in a format QuickTime could play. After some googling, I discovered I needed VLC. VLC allowed me to watch the best porn series ever. Good on you, VLC. 
6 VLC is good, though I usually prefer MPC-HC. Got both installed anyway.
11 TIL VLC started in France!
18 Does not work like that. It would be forked not 45 mins after such a move and that is why open source software is so resilient.
11 This is a good man, I approve
3 I think him!
5 Now these people are worthy of statues. Like Jonas Salk.
5 Merci monsieur Jean-Baptiste! 💜
4 Merci, Jean!
4 Merci from Folkestone, UK 
4 Merci from Poland! :)
6 Respect!I do hope you have enough money by other means!Thank for making VLC, btw.
5 VLC is like a post gone viral!....//I've seen it on roads construction, several of them and vehicles go round it. Respect man!!!
9 VLC is open source no? If someone put ads in it it would just be forked again without ads. I would have taken the money lol.
6 This guy did an AMA on r/france, it's a really cool guy haha
4 Thank you sir for this outstanding free media player! 
4 We need to donate to this man
4 If only redditor praises were a widely accepted currency, people might actually be able to live off doing stuff like this!
3 r/humansbeingbros
4 Merci :D
4 VLC media player still has some problems though with playing videos sometimes.That's why I use MPV player and have never looked back.
3 Get that man a cookie
3 and we all love VLC because of that too. Thank you!
3 Thanks a bunch, Jean-Baptiste.I know myself and I would have taken the money like a fool, no question about it. I'm happy that all people aren't as shitty as me.
3 Thank you jean-baptiste 🤘
3 God tier human! 
3 Merci from Mexico, Jean!
3 VLC is the best video player hands down. It works 99.99% of the time.
3 Didn't he also get donations form EU just now? Good for this guy! VLC is SO great
3 This is stupid, it’s open sourced and would fork faster than you could blink if they tried to monetize it. That’s the whole point of open source software, you CAN’T monetize it.
3 I respect him. I would've taken the money.
3 Merci, Jean!
3 Thanks :) 
3 One of, if not the best open-source programs on the net. Merci indeed.
3 God, I love open source software.
3 Hey /u/CopperOtter,This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
3 Instead of just giving upvotes, you can donate here:https://www.videolan.org/contribute.html

3 A [Translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/736ghk/ama_je_suis_le_pr%C3%A9sident_de_videolan_et_le/dnogswg/) on why* VLC is a cone.
3 Pour UNE fois que r/france avait une chance d'être sur la première page... 
3 MPC-HC is much lighter and less buggy
2 VLC is probably the single best program I have installed on every computer I have owned since it came out years ago. There have been other things, but VLC is pretty much the only one that has been great all along. No ads, no extra bullshit getting added with each iteration, just a quality media player that always does just what we need it to. 
2 Love this guy, wish that others would follow his lead... I'm talking to you Ajit Pai...
2 thanks!
2 Ge also believes in safety, as noted, by his headwear,
2 Hero!
2 He knew no one would use it if it had ads.
2 Mad props!
2 Wearing a traffic cone hat
2 The Cone of Fame
2 He definitely looks like that
2 I'm just realizing now how I take VLC for granted.. Gone are the days of downloading a million codecs in a in hope to play some video I torrented..  It's always one of the first things I installed whenever I reinstall windows.. I haven't been this loyal to a piece of software since winamp as original  my music player way back in a day... Beer money coming right up.
2 Today's Hero
2 Donation coming right up
2 VLC is super useful for all things video.  Thanks Jean!
2 HERO.
2 Merci Jean !
2 People like you are what the internet needs.
2 But everything changed when the Apple nation attacked 
2 On a side note. Jean, could you guys get your development team to fix the cropping feature that's broken on 2.2.6? Been on 2.2.4 for as long as I can remember.
2 I would like to see more of this type of recognition on reddit. Good people doing good work that helps us all. I love VLC and install it on every new PC I get. Merci Jean.
2 what a guy! I would have definitely sold you all out to the ad people for tens of millions.
2 Which Hogwarts house was he put in?
2 These kind of developers are heroes 🙏🙌<3
2 Not all heroes wear capes, sometimes they wear....uh....funny hats.
2 Dude’s ole school. This ain’t nuthin new for him 
2 When is Christmas cap going to show up?
2 the hero the world deserves 
2 VLC is open-source. We could easily remove the ads
2 Not all heroes wear capes, some do wear traffic cones though
2 Why would you give up millions to not inconvenience us for 30seconds?I almost feel bad now. I'd gladly watch a 30second ad in order to support a great product like VLC. 
2 I prefer MPC. But vlc is the second best.
2 Thanks for 20+ years of use.Keep kicking the llamas ass.
2 Why can't I still send my files to my Chromecast?
2 Some one should start a crowd fund called pay this guy back for the best media player ever.
2 PotPlayer is better still :) 
2 VLC is so good it will play VHS tapes
2 Well now I feel bad, we should raise some money for him!
2 Whenever Windows 10 updates, it changes the video and audio default program back to Windows' own bullshit software. I have to change my default settings back to VLC about once a month. I just wanted to get that off my chest since it's one of the most infuriating things ever and I love VLC. I can't wait til the little Santa hat pops up on the icon. It's one of my favorite things ever. 
2 Not all heroes wear cape. Some wear traffic cones as hats. 
2 GOD LEVEL! First thing I install right after Mozilla Fitefox is VLC Media Player, on every new install of any PC/OS.
2 thank you, awesome work man. there are no people like you these days. 🍻
1 You can draw a picture with crayons and put it under the keyboard and it will play on vlc. This is the 1st thing I install on any computer. Thankyou Jean
6 Mein Kempf! 
2 Can you imagine ads built into the video player though
2 Even though these days I prefer MPC-HC for my PC video playing needs, you can't ignore the impact that VLC had on user-friendly widely compatible desktop media players.     EDIT: I'm curious as to why I was downvoted. I was supporting this guys impact on media players despite acknowledging that I don't personally prefer VLC these days. Not mad, I'd just like some explanation.
1 MPC-HC is better. 
2 Stupid...
3 I thought that VLC player had been hijacked by the CIA and was used for spying
3 MPC-HC is 1000x better tbqh
1 "RAVENCLAW!" shouted the hat.
1 I'm not good with commitment but last week I started using vlc as my default program for a lot of file formats. 
1 Is great player - ty, sir
1 I think it is a very good idea to support people & foundations like this in times like these (EA etc.):https://www.videolan.org/contribute.htmlPS: They also accept Bitcoin. :)
1 VLC got me through some hard times when videos werent so easily accessible online. Dark days indeed. 
1 JB is a BAMF.
1 Go ger that money dude!! Guala guala
1 Hail Satan, Friend.
1 I'm a professional videographer and I use his technology every day. Thanks for making my job easier Jean!
1 Jean-Baptiste has done more to refine my movie watching experience than many. Thanks, Jean-Baptiste!
1 I use this program every day for my workouts.  Thank you so very much to this guy - what a king!
1 This man has given me the ability to watch media from around the world for like 20 years or something. Thanks so much VLC guy! We would be so less cultured without you! You the real MVP!
1 Modern hero right there
1 not all heroes wear capes
1 You sure he isn’t a Glaswegian with that hat on? 
1 😃 great stuffs
1 Thank you Jean-Baptiste!! You are one of our heroes!!
1 Hero 
1 Thank you from America (I'm sorry). 
1 PM your PayPal email! Thanks x
1 Sir, you are amazing. 
1 This guy deserves a medal! 
1 Aweome JBK!!! I use VLC to watch all my videos. you do great work.
1 Good guy Jean! Don't use VLC much anymore but that's because I don't often launch videos from outside Plex. 
1 Been using vlc for a couple years by far the best media player glad it will remain ad free and maleware free unlike most good softwares that get corrupted by big business and money
1 Can technology save the world？
1 What if I was to offer him hundreds of millions? 
1 Modern day HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 Loved VLC but ended up uninstalling it due to its version update process. Every few weeks there’d be an update and you’d have to confirm where you want it installed and then in what language. As if you’d change these things for a version update. I think I last counted that it involved 16 mouse clicks just to get the freakin’ update!  I’d rather have ads than do that 
1 Why? Unless he's already making crazy money, why would he turn that down?
1 Thank you, Jean-Baptiste! 
1 All just a well thought on plan to justify one day wearing that hat 
1 Not all hero’s wear capes. Some wear orange traffic cones
1 Go Jean! I use VLC every day!!
1 God Bless you Jean-Baptiste Kempf You are a precious and a rare specie... 
1 Cold blooded.
1 he should take the offer for a years advertising and then cancel everything and save the money. 
1 Is that the neon sorting hat？I want a turn！
1 This guy. I love him so much. That cone hat is fucking hilarious. We need more people like him for sure.
1 Hero !
1 ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 
1 bless this man. many wont remember what it was like to download a movie and be unable to watch it because you didn't have the right codex. HOURS of downloading (sometimes days) and guess what? you still can't watch that video! VLC is truly one of mans greatest achievements in the modern era.
1 A true hero 
1 In a world where we had a software market, guys like Jean-Baptiste wouldn't need a day job.  But for some reason, ~~Reddit~~ the people who would benefit most from a vibrant commercial software market are also the ones who most vehemently oppose paying for their tools.   They're also the ones who bitch the loudest because they can't find a programming job.   
1 Only a true hero like yourself would deny creating VLC
1 Look at all of the happy Europeans here, not worried about Net Neutrality. Be more like Europe, America.
1 I ran across VLC a few years ago and love it.
1 Good guy! I’ve always been fond of VLC
1 I love you
1 Merci you beautiful motherfucker
1 Us Europeans stick to our principles!
1 Thanks my dude. I don't know if you're also responsible for that, but I love VLSub
1 Anyone remember KMP? It used to be good but they totally sold out and ruined their product. I still occasionally download 10 year old versions of it; it did everything. 
1 Do you pronounce it Jean on Gean?
1 Even if they did accept ads VLC is open source so someone could just fork it and make a vlc ad free version ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
1 Merci Jean.
1 So that's were ads come from?Wow... This guy did some brave shit👏👏👏
1 Thank you jean-baptiste.
1 I have such a love hate with VLC. But it beats out basically every other media player.
1 da real mvp
1 Merci ! 
1 thanks french software designer seth rogen 
1 Love love love VLC! Been using it for years and years. Huge thank you!
1 I try to get my son to play his DVDs on VLC, but he keeps using Windows Media Player.  Well, we were playing a game in the background, and WMP scrambled his saved game somehow.  VLC is kilometers ahead of Microsoft.
1 Legend!!!
1 VLC is my goto player, although I prefer to watch my movies nicely sorted in my KODI media center
1 VLC is great.The recent update to the android version fixed most of my pet peeves with that version.I hope he gets to enjoy some free beer in France.
1 I love you, congratulation, keep up the amazing work, you are awesome <3 <3 <3 <3
1 anytime someone has trouble with video i tell them to download VLC.
1 I love this guy
1 The VLC label says can cause hallucinations? lol
1 Thank you sir!
1 Marryy mee dudeee lol😂
1 Good for him! I would have accepted the money, invest it somehow in real estate, stocks, prostitutes, maybe drugs, anything... what does he do for a living? 
1 [Jean-Baptiste Kempf but cooler.](https://i.imgur.com/EVilmUU.png)
1 Donated to the VLAN site. Only fair since I have been using your software for over a decade...
1 A free app with literally no competitor's.
1 I would’ve taken it.
1 The only player to reliably play downloaded porn on. Merci, Jean.
1 [Viva VLC player!!](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aqmndvY_700b.jpg)
1 World needs more people with similar values. Keep it up JB!
1 Just wanted to say 'hero'!.
1 I like that every  VLC version is named after a Discworld character. You look like Rincewind with that hat. No, not Rincewind but Ponder Stibbons 
1 VLC is like win-rar, you know its free but still feel inclined to pay for it. Also is it vlc cone or vlcone? 
1 You're a hazard, Jean
1 Can you disclose any information regarding that offer of ads in VLC?
1 not all ads are created equal. while i agree that popups in vlc would be a terrible idea, he could have done adwords or something benign and it would not anger users.
1 I've been using VLC since the early 00's and this guy looks 30. Was he in his lower teenage when he coded it?
1 Thank you for keeping such important software ad free. VLC is top notch.
1 And in the spirit of the season, here is Jean-Baptiste fending off grinchy assholes about the auto-implementation of the Santa Claus hat on the VLC logo during Christmastime:https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=96539
1 W
1 Looks like he got hacked in gta 
1 <3
1 meanwhile Wikipedia's panhandling adverts are getting worse and worse.shame on you Wikipedia, get a job like the rest of us.
1 I disagree.  Unfortunately good people often think  being kind hearted is nothing special and bad people think they are better than everyone else. My point being a good man is something you should be proud  of
1 Mercia Jean-Baptiste. Best video player ever! 
1 Props to him.  I remember dropping KMplayer when they pushed their ad infested version out.  Why must everything we love be ruined?
1 I mean, this is very admirable, but why is it more remarkable than any of the better video players that don't have ads?
1 Is that gesture an actual higher service to humanity (than just the no ads thing)?
1 I hope he's at least well-off though
1 Kudos, best video player that saved me from codec nightmare. Predinstalling on all PC's that I fix softwarely :)
1 Vivat Jean-Baptiste Kempf!!!   Viva VLC Player!!! 
1 Jean-Baptiste: la PVM Real. 
1 Thanks Jean 🙏🏾
1 This guy should run for president of the US
1 He is the coolest one I've ever seen. And the strongest. 
1 He is a brother and a wizard no meed for money 
1 Hero, and a great bit of software. Merci, mon copain.
1 V L C B O Y E
1 I use this program all the time. Thank you sir.
1 Fuck QuickTime!!!
1 Rêver après un film, aimer sur une chanson, ça n'a pas de prix. Merci pour un outil gratuit mais inestimable. Keep it up.
1 heh traffic cone
1 Not all heroes wear capes <3 
1 TBH, he can't do that, it's an open source project and he is a contributor, but let's say that he could and did, it not would have been worth it, a fork of the project would be started and it would become more popular in a year.

1 Donc Monsieur VLC est Français ? Quel honneur. Un français a donc créé l'un des meilleurs Media Player dans toute l'histoire d'internet !Déjà merci pour votre application M.JBK, elle est juste indispensable.Avec tout ce qu'on peut faire, est-ce que vous vous demandez en ce moment qu'est-ce que vous pouvez ajouter comme fonctionnalité ? :) 
1 I would gladly let the internet get me for that amount of money.
1 Should’ve offered to put a sidebar ad on it for a week and then fucked off with the cash. Machiavellian Internet. 
1 Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!&nbsp;******^I ^am ^a ^bot, ^probably ^quite ^annoying, ^I ^mean ^no ^harm ^though**^Message ^me ^to ^add ^your ^account ^or ^subreddit ^to ^my ^blacklist*
1 Thanks Jean!!
1 Thanks for VLC, it's marvellous.
1 This type of community service is weirdly popular among these hackers.
1 k lite is better
1 GRYFFINDOR!
1 Media player Classic is better tho
1 Why can’t I play 4k60 fps videos? Thanks!
1 Can we get this to the top?If you want to show your support, they have a donation field on the top right corner of the project website: http://www.videolan.org/
1 Unpopular opinion coming, I preffer GOM player much more even with the ads. It's just so much better for multiple screen users. 
1 Et en plus c'est un INpactien!!! :o)GG JB!
1 u/jbkempf AMA next week pls
1 The media player of choice in Australias criminal courts when displaying evidence.
1 i would fill that shit with ads in a heartbeat
1 Question to tech people. Are players like mpc and mpv equally good for someone that just watches videos and does not use any of the advanced features of vlc? 
1 He must go enjoyed working on it! Compensation enough.
1 You da man!!
1 Imo I would've taken that. Just a business move. Don't know if it'd pan out though.
1 i once donated to vlc and it said i would get a t-shirt for the amount, never got the shirt but never got mad because this program is always one of the first 10 programs i install! money well spend!
1 This man has big balls. I hope to have balls as big as his if and when the time comes for me to choose between doing something profitable and doing something good.
1 Why isn’t VLC on ninite?
1 The hero we need
1 I do not understand. Isn't VLC open source? What could happen if he had received those moneys and used to improve the software? While the code is available others could fork and remove the ads!
1 its stilly laggy as f to startup
1 Un français :)
1 I have been using and enjoying the player since 3 months ago as a glaswegian I always wondered  why the Duke of Wellington wore his cone with pride , The people of glasgow are simply fans of VLC haha https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/720/media/images/71051000/jpg/_71051828_71044344.jpg
1 The claim that he left millions on the table is hyperbolic nonsense. It is an open source project. If someone put ads on it we'd just fork the project to one without it and stop using the one with ads.
1 >>
1 Thanks
1 Safe to say, I would not have done the same thing.  I'd have sold out a long time ago.
1 VLC is dope! Love this guy 
1 He thinks too much, that cone is melting
1 Thank you
1 Feels like I’ve been using vlc since the turn of time, keep up the great work mate! Top job!
1 Merci indeed!
1 Much thanks man. My younger self couldn't have thanked you enough. 
1 VLC is crucial to my life, thanks for your contributions. 
1 Merci mon ami
1 If there is a fucking heaven this guy deserves its council
1 Vazy JB tu les nique. On t'aime 
1 Men, always men.
1 Seems like a lot of software makers try to make ‘open source’ or game changing software and then immediately sell out and go against their original purpose.Good on Jean-Baptiste!
1 I would have been fine with him taking the money. Moat of the time the app runs in the background anyway
1 You’re a true hero.  
1 VLC is literally a perfect program, it plays everything without fail and it’ll even try and play a JPEG if you make it 😂😂
1 It's free software; it'd just be patched out downstream anyway.
1 VLC is a very versatile piece of software, especially if you need to grab video off of youtube.
1 The moment I saw “creator of VLC” = immediately thumbs up
1 Thanks bro, this software has been a pleasure in my life for a long time
1 Merci !
1 Maybe this is already a thing and I just don't know about it.. but it would be GREAT if you guys included a sleep timer function on VLC. I used to use MPC before and that function was so usefull, if VLC had it it would be flawless. Many thanks to you! 
1 Shit
1 He must be millionaire already to refuse all that money
1 Thank you!!! 
1 Not all heroes wear capes.
1 So where did the sorting hat put you?
1 He looks like a good friend from High School.
2 700 odd comments.Nearly 27K votes.What fake agenda are you pushing OP? Slimeballs. The lot of them.He refused "tens of millions of EUROS". oooo
1 I do love VLC and used it for years but recently discovered IINA and actually like it more. [Link to IINA github page (for macOS)](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/)
1 But it installed adware when I updated it
1 Any souce on the ten of millions of euros thing? I don't believe it, if he put ads in VLC the community would just fork it and he'd lose control over his project. 
1 But has he sold out his fellow VLCians and his country to the FCC?
1 Would be nice if it didn't crash so much. 
1 nPlayer is better on iOS though
1 Someone is passing up 10mil euros ... for ads? Either he's already worth 10x more than that or he's an idiot.
1 He's not happy...trust me
1 Thank you Jean-Baptiste. Not a surprise thay you are not American, so you must have some kind of respect for socialist values. 
1 How anti-American... love it!! I will immediately donate on the videolan website. Thanks so much for keeping VLC ad-free.
0 He sounds like a fucking idiot.
0 too bad it's shit compared to MPC-HC
0 Media Player Classic is better
-6 MPC is twenty times better. 
-2 Fuck that 
-1 Reddit with its daily meaningless pat on the back.
-13 Wha is the problem on profiting on ones work?
-1 >What is the problem on profiting on ones work?>>There's no problem, it's just that not doing it makes him a great person. Being poor instead of rich makes you a good person.lmfao, if only being a good person put food on the table.
0 So EU is paying him a fuckton. That's almost better
0 Why does he have a traffic cone on his head?
0 Hungarians created mplayer wich became vlcplayer. Was first player that didn't need codecs to play a movie and ran fine on very potato pcs
1 Potplayer is better
1 He’s a fuckin idiot why would you turn down that money 
-17 So dumb. Take the 10 million and then fucking fork it.. This is the most stupid decision in the history of decisions. It's open source.. 
-3 Meh, MPC is better.
-8 What an idiot lol 
-6 is he the pedophile louis ck was talking about?
-1 he is anti freedom. https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=48356 does not allow you to run VLC as the root account easily.
-1 Had no idea creator of VLC wasn't American.
1 He's dumb.
-2 He just stupid for that
-18 As a VLC user,I would rather prefer that he would have gotten the money and put ads in it.We shouldn't be ashamed of monetizing our work(unless you are like EA,then you should die a thousand deaths)
-2 that's a very stupid thing to do
1 Fucking loser
-7 Are you kidding me?I fucking hate this guy.
-10 Anyone who refuses millions is a fucking douche
2074 Just wanted to drop in and say thank you for all you've done with VLC, loving it <3
402 Where can I get a hat like that?
237 > PPS: not my best photoThanks! </s>(I took the photo)
408 I don't have any questions. VLC's been my go-to media player since the mid-2000s, all thanks to the work you and the others in the project do. So, thanks for that!
286 People like you are what the internet needs.
208 Why haven’t you monetized/milked the vlc player?Thank you for creating this amazing player!
23 What has been the best part about working in this project?
25 What is a good photo of you? 
24 What's your favourite dinosaur?
169 An half naked women can get 1000 likes, but how many for our VLC boy in blue on r/Europe?
19 What is the main thing about being non-profit and open source that drives you every day to work on vlc?PS: ty <3
17 Awesome work for all these years!  Isn't developing such long-term project draining? How do you still find energy to continue doing this for over a decade?
17 That is your best photo, by a mile. 
17 Regardless, merci beaucoup!! 
13 💟💟💟
14 No question to ask, I just want to thank you for your contributions.
7 Any story behind the traffic cone as a logo? It's quite distinctive.
6 thank you from the bottom of my heart, not much to add
5 You are the saint of the internet now. We just need a more saintly photo shop of this current photo and you wearing a robe. 
9 What does VLC actually stand for?
16 Also, did you use your software to watch porn? 
9 > PPS: not my best photoshow us your best photo, then!
5 Thank you for being a good example and providing me with the tools to watch an MKV when I had no idea what I that was.
4 Hey man, thanks so much for supporting a tool that makes life easy for so many people at no cost. I'm an online grad student and it's my favorite way to watch my lectures at exactly the speed I want to. Oh, and thanks for delivering us from Windows Media Player hell :)
4 Refused millions to keep away ads. You didn't have to do that, but you did anyway. My hero!
3 Did a bunch of VLC people visit Disneyland Paris around 22 September? Were you among them?I remember seeing a bunch of people with the VLC hat on the train and on rides around Disneyland. :D
4 Thanks, you are great. Anyways I hate to be pernickety, but [your statue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Statue_of_Wellington%2C_mounted%2C_Glasgow_-_DSC06285.JPG) doesn't look like you at all.
3 Only a true hero like yourself would deny creating VLC 
3 Are you going to support Acestream at some point?
3 Man, thanks for all what you've done.
3 What are your thoughts on net neutrality? To you think the net will get more capitalized in the future?
3 Wait. It's non profit so what else do you do for a living?
3 Hello,When will VLC for windows support Chromecast?ty
3 What do you think about the web DRM standard EME?
3 Will you be adding support for VR soon?
3 Can't be surprised you're a Redditor ;P
3 Thanks for what you have done for this world :)
3 In hindsight, is there anything you would do differently now regarding the VLC project?
3 thank mr kempf
3 Thank you, keep up the good work!
3 Can you tell the story behind versions being named after Discworld characters?
3 Why does VLC have a delay when I adjust the volume slider 
3 It's awesome how the VLC logo changes around this time of year... do you plan on adding anymore ... Like Halloween cone. Like a witch's hat <;) 
3 > PPS: not my best photoCe n'est pas vrai! La photo est magnifique!But really, thanks for all the work you've done for VLC!
3 Will you lot be hanging out at FOSDEM?
3 Thanks mate
2 Thank you for your program and your work. On this international day of the volunteer (your day) you should treat yourself and the other volunteers at VLC. One question though. Is there an easy way to just cast any video on my pc to my old samsung smart tv easy? Not fidling with ip adresses and such? 
2 I use VLC since 10+ years, hats off to everyone involved and keeping it really free!Please consider setting up a bitcoin wallet to donate to, Paypal is evil^^Regards and a huge THANK YOU to Paris!
2 What would be the best way to donate money to you? I want to support people who take a stand like this!
2 ~~Hats~~ cones off to you, monsier!
2 I wouldn't have been able to watch this many movies effortlessly without your application! You've provided me happiness
2 If I was in the position between earning a stable salary and being a millionaire even if that meant ruining my rep I would probably take the millions since people forget and get over stuff fast...What keeps you so pure? 
2 > Ask me anything, I guess.How much did you pay for the Sorting Hat skin? :)
2 Since I tried many players and only VLC worked, I want to say big thank you for keeping the player way it is right now: stable, not BSODing my pc, and being everything for any kind person: that just HAS to fiddle with every setting to make it right or for a person that just wants to install it and watch something right away without any problems.<3
2 How does VLC make money?
2 Vlc best media player ever. You've been my go to gor the past 6 years. Thank you guys for all the seemless movie watching nights. 👊
2 VLC is awesome. How many hours per week do you spend on it. What’s your full time job if this isn’t it. Do you find it harder and harder to be support such a popular open source project as this with little to no compensation while you have the potential to make so much more???Thanks a lot in advice and you seem like a really cool dude!!
2 I only use vlc on everything, on the iPhone, pc, IPad. You made my life a lot more easier 
2 Thank you! VLC for life! And family members who don't understand codecs!
2 Thank you
2 Thank you
2 Will there ever be native Chromecast support for VLC on desktop?? It's the only thing lacking and the alternatives are pretty awful compared to VLC. 
3 How often do you get “Mein Kempf” jokes?
1 How did you find the time/get others? to find the time to work on a project where there was no real motivation other than to create the software itself in a market where there are plenty of paid versions (where developers are earning money) which do what VLC set out to do? — albeit usually not as well as VLC)From the millions of users, thank you. Your software is unimaginably useful and it’s great that it’s remained free. Up until now I took this for granted.
1 OMG- Seriously. You are too humble.
1 Thanks man!
1 Just wanted to say thank you. I'll be requesting my parents make a donation in lieu of a Christmas present. 
1 Just wanted to compliment you with your project! And for VLC, it's always ticked whenever I go to ninite.com or help people out with their computer. Great work!
1 Thank you :3
1 God bless you fam
1 u are a champ m8
1 I've been asking this in AMAs for a very long yet I always get ignored, but you seem like a nice person so I'm sure you'll answer me...Boobs or ass?
1 les gens pourrait etre intéressés par un AMA nan? ils ont l'air de t'aimer :b puis pas de raison que yai que nous sur r/france a avoir le privilège...
1 I've used VLC for more than 10 years and just yesterday(!) I updated from 1.1.5...congrats on such a piece of reliable software! Any other cool projects you're working on, things that I can use for another 8-10 years without updating? :)
1 I have one question, VLC on my 4k panel dosent scale correctly. Like all the buttons are super tiny. Is there a fix, or an update coming?
1 I love vlc and all it does! Thank you man!!
1 Hey....I love you !!
1 Are you planning a VR / Mixed reality mode?
1 Do you have a donation address for other crypto-currencies ? Bitcoin has very high fees that are impractical for little donations. I would propose ETH and BCH at least. Congrats for all the work !
1 You're the bomb.com thanks for everything.
1 Thank you! Want some Maltese beer?
1 when someone says they cannot open a video/audio-file. i always tell them to try VLC. one could stuff toast in it and it would give you video and sound
1 What's certain decisions lead VCL to it's prime?
1 Thank you so much for all the work you do and still keeping this free! Teams like yours are what the internet needs! Especially in times like this where net neutrality and data selling are so talked about. It's easy to only focus on money, not easy to focus on principles :)
1 rip inbox
1 First of: Thank you! VLC is one of the best programs and one of few that still is free from adds and malware etc. Once again, thank you!In SMPlayer you can search for and download subtitles within the program it self. This is the one thing that got me to switch from VLC. It soooo good. So I guess my question is; will you ever add this function?
1 N'oublie pas de leur dire que tu m'as demandé de partager ma collection de porno mec.
1 Thanks for the amazing tool you made or helped maintain! It’s a huge deal and you should be proud of!Btw, the photo is awesome
1 I believe VLC has semi-automated crash reports (or had them, hasn't crashed in a while). What percentage of the ones submitted have porn titles in them?
1 Just wanted to say thank you for helping provide such a wonderful media player. I don't know what I'd do without it.Just built a new PC, and VLC was one of the first 5 pieces of software I put on it. I'm fairly certain I've converted all my friends at this point. 
1 So if it’s non-profit, does it mean you guys are not earning (much) from it? Because I think you should, since so many people enjoy VLC. 
1 What led to choosing a traffic cone as the logo?
1 VLC has been my first choice since my first computer, ten years ago. I can't imagine a computer without it. Thank you.
1 You’re the reason I can watch .mkv videos on my iPhone! WiFi transfers are great, thank you!!
1 Thanks, been using vlc player for years, great player :) 
1 You mentionned Swartz in another comment. Who are your internet heroes ?  
1 It's a great photo JB!
1 Just wanted to say thank you. VLC player has liberated us from the dark ages of needing to download the codecs. Thank you and the team and everyone involved.
1 Does the EU support you in any way?
1 VLC > *
1 Can you share your best photo?
1 thanks for all you do!
1 Love that vlc plays Amiga mod files. Are you planning to support more niche filenames in the future?
1 you are cool and my gf says you are cool too
1 thank you
1 So, is chromecast streaming coming to VLC? :)
1 As someone who has used VLC a lot, thanks for your work!
1 What is your favourite photograph of yourself?
1 Can I see another picture of you?
1 Thank you for all your work on VLC, its hands down the best videoplayer there is. You are a much better person than I am not monetizing VLC, lol i would in a heartbeat.
1 Merci !Envisagez vous de passer le relais pour vous consacrer à d'autres projets ?Joyeuses fêtes !
1 Hey, Jean-Baptiste.  Been using VLC since it was first offered to the public.  Really great product and we all thank you and your team for keeping it ad free!
1 Not really here to ask you anything.  I just want to thank you.  
1 I have been using this player so long and yet people always ask me what it is. This I always find so surprising since every other player falls so short its almost hilarious at this point.Thanks for all you do.
1 Can you tell us how to correctly pronounce VLC cone? 
1 thank you for your work! 
5684 Send me some beer?EDIT: as this exploded (RIP inbox), I'll give you pictures of the VLC beer I made! (See child comment)
208 On that note, is it possible to donate to him? 
169 Well, for starters the European Commission announced a few days ago that it will [fund a bug bounty program for VLC.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-eu-will-foot-the-bill-for-vlc-players-public-bug-bounty-program/)  This is conducted in the framework of the [EU-FOSSA](https://europa.eu/digitec/news/eu-fossa-project/) project voted in the European Parliament. MEPs Julia Reda, Max Andersson (both Greens/EFA), and Marietje Schaake (ALDE) have spearheaded this project and asked for more fund to enable these initiatives. So a good way to help apart from direct support is to *go vote* at European parliamentary elections (because yes, they matter) and research which candidates align with your interests.
5 You are aware you can donate to VLC? If you like it, pay it! Edit: Added Contribution linkhttps://www.videolan.org/contribute.html
12 Well until now we've been donating freely, frankly the model's been doing wonders until now. However it seem the new groove is to have the government pay for it. Well, I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that.
1 I agree turning that down is almost impossible, money would win the heart of 99% of the people who would have this offer come to them. He's a one of a kind person for declining that money, however something to repay him for what he's doing is definitely in order
1 I remember a time where open source was going to be the shit. Collectively we certainly have the brainpower to make better products than these giants do. Facebook sucked from the beginning, google and co is cluttered by bullshit, it's all full of ads, so much energy is wasted on marketing wanking and scheming, technology should go forward, not fuck us sideways. Yes, I'm doing very well without FB.
1 With tens of millions of dollars maybe?
1 You can’t. Capitalism is why Facebook exists the way it does. Want well intentioned people building well intentioned products? Create a well intentioned system...
1 Basic Income? Oops nevermind. I'm now a communist and barred from opportunities.
0 Maybe nooow you people will finally see the obvious fact that nobody respects people like him, they just want entertainment and they don't care about the money / privacy they have to give up for those things.Privacy? Ad-free? you exaggerate the importance those 2 things have to the average bloke
358 Thanks a lot!PS: also, why on /r/europe?
158 it's a feature i have grown so accustomed to that i get frustrated when it's missing from, like, everything else.
35 meh I'm still mad, it used to go to 400 until they nerfed it to 200!(pretty sure they both go to the same actual volume. But still. Pls gib 200 more)
39 I shall celebrate by watching spinal tap with the volume at 200%
9 If you go over 100 then you can get [audio clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_\(audio\)).  It is better than nothing, but turn up your system volume first.
1 I used this for years, until I realised it destroys the audio quality. Never used it since. 
1 just wondering  why do you use VLC on a daily?

2 Unironically this.VLC is for plebs.
1 Let me put it to you this way LF.  If you've ever had an issue playing a media file because of its format, VLC is a godsend.  Has been for a loooooong time.  Long live the orange cone.
1 > BAMFBAMF?
0 if you are a professional you should know about the color issues of vlc. vlc is not good for anything involving color

1 Could you mail me, please? jb@videolan   -org
1 My balls are very normal, but thanks for caring!
1 It should be.
1 THIS is how a media player should be like
6 You probably downloaded it from CNET or those shady sites. Always download software directly from the provider. 
3 You can ask many people in the community who will confirm.
5 I am very happy. My life is great.
3 Haha 
3 While I agree, MPC has been abandoned and won't get updates anymore (I still use it though), but it's a matter of time until it gets discontinued. 
26 What’s the problem with sacrificing money to give your users a better experience?
5 Of course there is no problem, *but*, this is a very different thing where shady people have been trying to put adware/spyware in popular OSS software by buying them off. People like Jean have been effectively protecting us, open source users, from this bullshit for a while.Oh, and even if you don't use VLC directly, it is so widespread you probably used it or parts of it indirectly, very much like other projects like Linux and Curl.
7 There's no problem, it's just that not doing it makes him a great person. 
3 euh. My bank account disagrees.
5 Because the VLC icon is a traffic cone
9 No. I am not. Doing something that YOU don't understand does not mean that I am an idiot.
2 Uh why?
3 You have no idea what you are talking about. Sorry to say that. You should not do anything as root on a normal Linux.And if you have a good reason to do so, you have the skillz to recompile VLC.
15 You can get money in other ways than simply ads
3 But a very moral one at that
3 Someone doesn't get "internet is free and for everyone", that's why we have freeware, open source and net Neutrality, if you want the opposite get out of internet and use cable and other media. 
4 Why though ?

5 The first versions where Goldeneye characters, because it was the first DVD we played with VLC. Then we decided to move to DW, because I loved the books and it provided with an infinity of names.

712 Where are you?
135 So, short story time:2 years ago, for VDD 2015, we decided to brew some VLC beer.As it was a VLC beer, it needed to be special: we plugged a tablet with VLC playing StarWars+StarTrek in loop, with speakers, in order to "excite" the yeast (so they could be impregnated with movies spirit), for the whole maturation. For that, we modified the bucket to be almost transparent at the top and attached the speakers to the bucket to transmit the vibrations.And also, the beer was orange/yellow because of the ingredient we put there.You can find a funny photo here of the result: http://people.videolan.org/~jb/VLC_Beer.jpgUnfortunately, those are the 2 beers left, and the color went away a bit :)
176 Hey man, just wanted to say thanks. Seriously. Incredible, free software is hard to come by. 
34 Just wanted to say thank you for VLC; it's been my go to player for the past 10+ years on every PC I ever owned!
64 will you accept a winrar license ?
31 I'm down for a beer donation.  VLC is the only software I've used for a decade (is that right?) that didn't become aids for my computer 
84 Let me just say you are my hero. Thank you. 
20 Best reddit answer ever.
18 We all would!If you ever in London I'd show you around town. 
17 I just wanted to say thank you so much. You have saved so many evenings where I've had to hunt certain subtitles on certain languages for my friends and fit them to movies! VLC has been such a good programme all this time!
7 Oh my god. Thank you SO MUCH for your work and principles. I would buy you a whole brewery if I could. You deserve all the best <3
13 Dude! You really the guy? 
11 Thank you for your hard work. I use VLC a lot and I love it. You rock.
6 My school district in Texas is totally reliant on VLC to functionThank you so much!!!!!!
6 Please come to Vancouver, Canada and stay as our guest. We all really appreciate your software very, very much.

2 Someone give this comment gold.
2 You change the time we live in for the better with your creation, I use it everyday!
2 Oh man, I love VLC so much. I'll send you some beer too! It's saved the day dozens of times, as recently as last night. A friend bought a DVD she didn't realize was region locked. Her DVD player wouldn't play it so I just put it in my PC and it played with absolutely no issues. It's my #1 go-to media player, and I've never paid a cent for it. I think it's probably time for me to set up a recurring donation. The folks at VLC deserve every penny. 
3 LOL!
1 You should have a casting feature. 
1 How about we sent you a brew kit.
1 Just wanted to say I've been using VLC for over 12 years as my go to media player. Thank you for your hard work man. PM me an address (PO box or whatever) so I can send you some awesome Manx beer for Christmas. 
1 Thank you for managing VLC for all these years. 
1 Thank you for making VLC and keeping it cancer free.I use VLC for all of my videos.
1 The man, the myth, the LEGEND
1 I'm pretty sure that if I'd put a slice of cheese into my CD drive, VLC player would still be able to play it. You are awesome man, thanks for being you. 
1 Pretty sure I saw you guys at Fosdem drinking *a lot* of beer :-) 
1 La frontpage de reddit, monsieur ne se refuse rien ! /r/france était trop petit ?Sérieusement, ça fait plaisir de voir ta bobine :)
1 I'm stateside and can't afford to send you beer overseas. Can I drink a delicious local beer in your honor? What is your preferred type? Hell, I hate IPAs and I'd even drink one for you.
1 Tu as un bar habituel ? Que je puisse t'en offrir.
1 Hey man just wanted to say as a guy who ran AV support for 5 years at a popular venue VLC saved my ass countless times when a client would bring in some random file that reufused to play on anything else.  I totally owe you that beer. 
1 *sees all the beer offerings* Step aside peasants .. this guy needs some good ol german beer!
1 Thank you for your software !!! I will aim to put a donation through soon 
1 You are a fucking hero my friend. Stay awesome!Will send you some beer when I've got some money to spare again :/
1 Hamburg calling, jot a line if you're aroundThanks for VLC!!

1 Long trip to send beer for me, but I sent some beer money along. Thank you!
1 I would so send you booze or tasty snacks from texas. /r/snackexchange is my jam.Seriously. Best media player ever. The fact that you didn't try to monitize it out the ass when you seriously could have says a lot.Set up a PO box and I will send tribute my liege.
1 Thank you so much for all of your hard work, and for refusing to sell out. I have been using your software for something like 14 years, and nothing comes close to replacing it.I only wish I was skilled enough to contribute to the effort, as a method of payment. Maybe one day!
1 Just adding to it all — I use VLC player every day, thank you for keeping it hassle-free.
1 Si un jour tu viens sur Brest, la murge sera à mes frais :)
1 We can donate their cause!http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html

1 Can I buy one of those sweet hats and support the foundation? USA.
1 And you're a homebrewer!! Here I though you couldn't get any cooler. If you're ever in the US (Southern California), I'd love to share a few beers with you.

56 As much as I appreciate the program, I think these one-off funding programs are about as effective as the Potemkin incubators and tax benefits have been to promote Silicon Valley start-up culture: not much.American start-up spots developed around academic establishments with strong technical programs, low rent housing and offices, and access to steady financial support . We need to consider that these are people with quality of life needs that stretch years into the future and simply throwing them some scraps isn't going to do.Still, it's better than nothing. And I would vote for anyone that promotes it further, unfortunately I won't be able to vote for someone like Julia Reda for quite awhile unless the European lists are brought into being.
9 ALL HAIL THE EU!
6 > Julia RedaHot damn, this might be the first actual accomplishment involving the German Pirate Party.
3 Already have, someone already posted a link above.
22 The internet is dominated by companies running proprietary software and creating walled gardens. The internet, as the Pirate Bay founder pointed out, is broken. IT in  general for the general population is broken.And the people trying to create the next parasite to suck out your data and plug you into another software/product ecosystem are getting millions of euros in one go and media buzz. The people putting in work for open source are in comparison unthanked heroes working in an increasingly hostile technical environment.So, no, I don't think donating freely has done wonders. I think we need to do better, and it's not going to happen by regurgitating the "distributed, decentralised,  voluntary, free" buzzwords rather than implement a societal plan to actually make that work.
1 Facebook exists in an ecosystem formed of corporate governance regulations, trademark and intelectual property protections, and financial instruments all made possible by the current legal framework. It's not just a matter of "capitalism" that is causing the issue.That being said, my off the head idea was creating a Max Plank Institute-like organization for creating and legally supporting open source software. Perfectly doable without needing a revolution.
368 because we are proud of you
46 Thanks for this man
23 I love you. 
28 Merci à toi pour mes heures passées devant VLC.
22 > PS: also, why on /r/europe?Because if VLC was made in the US it would have been full of advertisements or other attempts for monetization. Not sure if that is true, but we like to think that to feel superior. 
7 You're a european hero
4 Why are internet wizard hats so strange?
3 Maybe because of thishttps://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7hhbdq/european_parliament_has_approved_budget_for_vlc/
1 I think I might be a "maillon de la chaine", there was a post on /r/linux ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7hgukh/european_commission_launches_first_ever_bug/)) about VLC being part of a bug hunt funded by the EU comission (they are using VLC internally and start a bug bunty program -- they choose VLC as a first implementation of it). I remembered the fact that you turned down millions for our sake and casually mentionned it in the thread.Maintenant tu es l'homme le plus classe ~~du monde~~ d'Europe.
1 You're the best!!!!!!!! I remember back in the limewire days your software opened my entire (virus ridden) video library I had downloaded (win media player was trash). Dude you're the best thank you for such a quality piece of software.
1 because /r/world doesn't exist
1 Tu compte expliquer pourquoi c'est un cône ? Tu as évité la question lors de l'AMA
1 So I've seen this post before and I wondered why you didn't just take the money, safe in the knowledge that someone would fork it and remove the ads anyway?
12 > meh I'm still mad, it used to go to 400 until they nerfed it to 200!well, the old was a linear curve, now it is a quadratic one, because it is closer to your ear. The old 400% is the new 200%, the same level.
26 The extra 200 will come in a future DLC so you can get the full experience. 
23 111%
4 I just treat it like an accessibility feature - sometimes the media base is just too low OR your situation requires that you deal with the loss and turn it up just to hear what's going on.  I think it's really well implemented and the clipping is unavoidable.  
4 I mean, it’s supposed to be used if audio was given way too much headroom to begin with. It won’t fix shitty audio, but it helps so much with bad mixes if you don’t have any other audio interface. 
2 Because it's my main media player.
1 I don't.  That's why I said "the other day" instead of "every day".
31 In that case it would be VLANC!!! You can't form acronyms like that! This is madness!!!
196 Or perhaps a Vastly Lackluster Croissant?

5 > Was he already rich and said no?Clearly not. Both of my parents are professors and we have no family wealth.
1 That's a good question
36 Chances are you would also sell any right over any code you or anyone wrote for your application. They aren't stupid neither.
15 Just like Monty did: sold MySQL to Oracle for $15M, then forked it and founded MariaDB, and started [actively campaigning against MySQL.](https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2271011/mysql-creator-monty-widenius-wants-it-to-disappear-from-the-earth) A pretty ballsy move, if you ask me.
8 > Because I'm not a fucking idiot. I am not an idiot. There are other things in life than money.
1 I think this was once answered by them actually. They said essentially users are idiots. There's going to be a surprising number of people still continuing to install the "VLC + Adware" version until the end of times, simply because of the brand, even if there is a forked version that's better and adware free. 
36 They don't have double first names in english speaking countries? I never thought of that.Ninjaedit: They have in the south of the US I guess.

3 Could you be nice enough to report this on our bugtracker, please?
4 Faut bien s'occuper, quoi ! 
1 regardless of the author of the source code the sentiment is the same.that is why you see a lot of libre-something names. most of them are forks due to the community not argeeing with something that the original -or subset of- team did.
1 Really? (0.o)Is that...
1 You can sell STEEM . But is full of Indians
3 Nope. You are the idiot.
1 While you CAN monetize it, the fork would become the new standard in a matter of months. Linux distros would ditch the old project, "tech" websites would start recommending the new one, and so on...Those who think "bollocks, the old project has a lot of traction, the forked one would never catch up" need to look no further than big open-sourced projects that had most of its collaborators leave in favor of a fork, like OpenOffice to LibreOffice, uBlock to uBlock Origin and so on.I commend the decision to refuse tens of millions of euros because it means the companies offering it didn't get scammed out of their money.
0 Very philosophical.  That money could be put toward new products headed by the same great team. 
1 Bad Ass MotherFucker.
1 Originally NY but I now find myself in Illinois. 
1 Thanks mate. I think I’ll give it another shot. 
1 I've always run into an issue with no video but I get sound, it happens often enough to notice, but after a restart or two it works. I honestly don't know why it does it.
1 Winrar isnt free? I mean i knew that pesky pop up was asking money but i thought it was ad. Anywhosle i used it for 7 years, guess i got my money worth 😂Ill try 7-zip which is totally free 😉
1 No need, checked it myself. I checked his age. He's 34, not much younger than myself, in fact. That makes him 17-18 years old or so in 2001. Thanks anyway!  Edit: Damn, didn't realize. Sorry, Mr. Kempf!
1 La classe et ....j'ai envie de dire CHAPEAU !  ;-)
1 Ha ha, figuratively of course! Anyway, thanks man, and keep up the good work! VLC is still my go-to video player no matter what operative system I’m currently using.
1 Okay, hmb, I’m going to sort this!Edit: I’m an idiot. It’s been there all the time and I’d not spotted it [slap to forehead]
1 Actually, it is ! And since a llooonnnggg time.
2 I did! I never had any problems before but after an official update it installed a spam homepage in my browser. I gotta admit I didn't select the manual update though.
1 I'll take your word on it. Thanks for your work on VLC
1 Wasn't taking about you....try and read more carefully 
1 Did you grow up reading Pif Gadget perhaps ? ;)
3 Work for free then, go be a 'great' person. Even though if he accepted money he could do actual great things, like help the poor and needy, but ay, apparently being *great* just means giving Redditors free shit. Who would have knew.
-3 Lol
598 Next release will be a lot better though.
5  Love VLC for the most part but has anyone had a problem with it (edit: on Android) in the last week or so? Like there's an update that messed things up? There's a bunch of my music that isn't being recognised in the library that used to be there, messes up artists and albums in a way it didn't used to (like randomly sorting tracks from the same album into two different folders with the same name). I've had to switch to an alternative for the moment.
1 What do you watch on the android app?
1 Same here, got fed up with MX player.
-23 As someone who watches a lot of videos with subtitles on my Android phone I feel like BS player is more packed and feature rich than VLC. UI is ugly af though but the app itself is great 
6 You have certainly helped me with my inevitable duty as IT guy for all the elderly people in my family. VLC is a lot more streamlined, and intuitive compared to other paid apps. Click and enjoy.
4 Thanks :) It is very rare nowadays that a company tries to keep free!Keep it up mate
1 Thank you!!
172 How
30 Just want to jump in saying I like the VLC Wizard Hat quite a lot.EDIT: Does it sort you by file extension type?
7 It would be cool to be able to buy it to support you guys
3 Can't I just buy it off you?
1 When I see a traffic cone on the roads I still think "VLC".
3 Is it?
78 Most nerds are on reddit :D.
14 You look great my dude
4 I think you look cute and probably would fuck you the first night I meet you. I've been lurking for a while and this is my first post just to say that.
34 It’s aged really well compared to most programs that are free. Most tend to die out, lose relevance, or get bought out and loaded with ads. 
-1 [deleted]
52 The world needs heroes who step up where they are in life, with the abilities they have. You've clearly done that, and you have my thanks. To be honest, I didn't know your name until 5 minutes ago, but VLC has long been one of the first programs I installed on any PC I owned. The fact that you're so humble about it just reinforces /u/Darth_S0t0TR's point. I'm a middling geek with three mini-geeks in training. Aaron Schwartz provides an excellent, if tragic, role model of someone with great abilities that were only exceeded by his principles. But if I need an example for my kids of how and why to resist the urge to sell out in everyday life, I'm pointing to you, and there's nothing you can do about it. :-)
20 Sorry for my ignorance, but who is A. Schwartz. Wiki results yield a retired US Air Force general.
4 I'm also unaware of A. Schwartz. You seem to love technology though.
1 Did you know him personally?
1 Aaron Swartz, J.B. Kempf, même combat!
390 Instead of paying $5 to reddit, I'll make a note to donate it to the project when I get home. Consider yourself gilded in spirit.
117 >Because that's not right.If only the rest of the world were like you.. It would be a so much better place.
32 Thank you, Sir. We need more guys and girls like you!
14 how do you make money off of vlc?
3 Someone thought>Oh boy, that comment makes me feel like paying reddit!
2 tell us the secret to being a great person, you seem to have it all figured out.
2 Thanks man!
2 holy shit that's so deep.
1 Just wanted to say thank you so much for VLC. It's the first program I install after a fresh operating system. This has reminded me I need to redonate! Keep up the amazing work. Thanks again!
1 Think of all the waffles you could buy!
1 Communist!
1 What side jobs do you do to sustain yourself if vlc is non-profit?
1 We don’t deserve you
1 Who do you think you are? Jesus or something?Seriously, I’ve been using VLC since it came out. Thanks for all your hard work!
1 But if you took the money, you could put it to better use than the companies who would be doing the advertising. You could help build orphanages, put money toward curing cancer, or start building infrastructure to work on solving global hunger. Hell you could just use it to pay for a bigger company, employing hundreds of people, to make a better media player or even other better technologies. I get you don't want to inconvenience people just to fulfill your selfish desires, like buying a boat, but that doesn't necessarily mean that putting up ads is wrong. Our entire world economy is basically built on it. 
1 free software is such a tear-inducingly beautiful thing
1 Have you considered applying for FCC chairman position?
1 Do you think it's immoral to profit of something someone creates then? Not trying to argue genuinely curious, I love VLC and I think it's great, but I wouldn't say you were "wrong" or a bad person or something if you tried to make some money off your own invention. 
-3 How come? You put some effort in it, nobody would judge you if you monetized it.
33 Yes, that is also an important point. But people would still go to videolan.org.
1 That would create an OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice situation
10 Not everyone but still far too many people, sadly :(
8 People (like /u/kidajske) are so indoctrinated that it doesn't occur to them that you don't *need* to run your product like a massive money printer in order to make an impact on society. Reddit gives so much insight into how the average businessperson views their "market" that it's almost nauseating. Open source projects like VLC are the best representation of the human spirit, to spend your time creating something that benefits humanity and only requesting enough support to continue that project. 
1 How does selling a product you created make you a corporate boot lick? It's great that it's free but there would be nothing wrong with charging for it. 
5 Do you ever stop and think, "why can't Microsoft with their billions make a decent video player?"
7 You're one of my rule 34 dreams, so I was hoping and assuming steps behind good looks. 
7 solid choice
1 Hey, with the abandonment of MPC, would you ever consider updating your interface functionality to the level of MPC-HC?I mean, VLC seems very and purposefully unintuitive. It can technically do more than MPC, but it's always so clumsy.Literally, MPC is has been my primary video media player because of its flexibility- I can shrink the player to my liking with a few keys+mouse, remove the edges/window, zoom in, out and far more, and I can do it VERY easily.The shorthand I have with this player is remarkable. I would love to see the same for a robust player, such as VLC.BTW, thanks for building the best back up media player.
7 What do you do to recharge?
1 tell us, please
1 How do you keep from letting it get stale? As a software developer I find myself in periods of “writers block” where I simply can’t bring myself to work on a certain project because I’m just burned out on it. Not sure how to overcome this one yet.

6 Kinda :)
17 Best answer.
3 Dat HD tho. ;)
3 VLC has awesome network streaming features ;)
2 Me.
2 Why would you want to download (stream) your favorite video(s) again every day or so ? :)
1 Vlc can play streams
2 Would you accept such a patch? :P
1 Still very inconsistent on the nightly builds...Randomly stops during a video or it takes a long time to play the video.
3 Glad to hear. But sad that some countries don't allow you reverse engineer it.
2 The releases being named after DW characters is my favourite thing about VLC. GNU Terry Pratchett!
3 Says 2.2.6 umbrella, but when I check for updates it says I have the latest version. 
1 Great, just sent some bits for the good cause.
2 🤔 It didn't work so well over in Ireland
3 That’s rough. I’m sorry for bringing it up, man. Apologies. 
1 euh je sait pas ce que ca veut dire et je trouve rien sur internet, j'imagine que ca veut dire que c'est vaguement prévu un jour ou l'autre?si oui nice pour eux
1 What might that be? :)
1 In this order, Avast, Winrar, VLC, Steam, Chrome. 
1 [Nice!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYt0WbDjJ4E)
1 oh man, i am melting...VLC god has answered...Thank you sir...you are an inspiration. p.s. I am using it beyond 100 volume level and my neighbors are not happy :D

6 Do you plan on making some more? I'd love to try some.
7 The label says can cause hallucinations. 😂 
4 Rare vlc beer. Put it on ebay :D
2 Si vous en refaites je vous fais une super étiquette pour fêter ça !
2 What style?
2 Care to share the grain/hops/yeast bill so homebrewers can try to re-create it? 
78 >  free software is hard to come byOnly on commercial operating systems. If you were to use e.g. Linux (which is free itself) you will discover that millions of people use (and contribute to) free software/open source software. And the open source variant often surpasses the commercial competitor in terms of quality.
1 It's actually not. There are a lot of programs on Linux :)
17 Thanks man!
64 YES! A 9000 times yes!
5 does such a thing even exist ? 
1 in crypto or bolivar?
1 I'd send some bitcoin.
3 You are welcome.
13 I've used VLC media player for a long time and had no idea that you could get subtitles with the program! Here's an [article](https://www.techworm.net/2016/11/download-subtitles-automatically-vlc-media-player.html) on how to do this.
2 I totally now how you feel. I'm totally that guy for my spanish friends.Also, along with everyone else, thank you for VLC, man, damm good piece of software that one. Totally behind some sort of PayPal donation. Hell, I can't repay you for all the hours I've been using your software for free without ever putting a though about the creator, but if everyone just reading this would drop a tenner to give thanks for your work that might be a different story.Or hey, you wanna be paid in beer we can make that happen too. Just drop a public box address as suggested and make sure to pick the biggest box they have, cause you might have a few cases coming your way.
3 No go! I couldn't fit a brewery in my living room!

22 I agree with everything you've said, as a postdoc researcher in a technical field who is painfully aware of the precarious situation we endure, at least in my country. However as you say "still, better than nothing". I hope little by little the ball can start rolling. Agree as well in the European lists, we need them yesterday.
6 > Still, it's better than nothing.Yes, it's a good first step.
2 Hopefully it won't be a one-off: It's an official pilot project which may become instutionalized if shown to be worthwhile – Erasmus started out just like this.
35 Don't underestimate how much Julia Reda has done for technical sanity in the European Parliament. Also, please vote for her next election, she's pretty much the only lifeline we have to what is actually going on in the committees. 
4 Julia Reda has done amazing stuff in the past and she's currently fighting for a better copyright law! You should read up on her, easily one of the most upright and progressive politicians out there, mostly because she actually knows what she's working on.
2 Here's her explanation of the (first iteration of the) program: I raised €1 million to demonstrate security and freedom aren’t opposites https://juliareda.eu/2014/12/1-million-for-open-source-security/

1 Hey /u/robbit42, maybe we could give /u/jbkempf a small nice flair to show our appreciation for the impromptu AMA and also [being a great guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7hqusx/this_is_jeanbaptiste_kempf_the_creator_of_the_vlc/dqt7wkf/)? Something like...?    .flair-VLC + .author::after {        content: "▲";        color: #EE7600;        text-decoration: underline;        padding-left: 3px;        vertical-align: 1px;    }

3 Ok. Kind of makes sense.
1 Pas du tout, relis l'AMA.
3 Get outta here with your reason.In all seriousness, thanks for making the early 00s video watching possible. I dreaded codecs and VLC solved all that shit forever (for me at least). 
38 The intent is to provide viewers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking higher volume levels? /s
1 And what media do you consume on VLC?
1 Sorry I misunderstood
1 This is outrageous, it's unfair!
1 It's acronyms all the way down
80 "Croissant" actually means "growing".(that's not a joke: the word comes from the shape of the moon's waxing crescent, which happens during its "growing" phase, and it is the present participle of the verb "croître" ("to grow"). Also the English "crescent" comes from old French "creissant".)
38 ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ
3 What makes an acronym an acronym is not the initials themselves, it's how the speaker chooses to pronounce them. If I were to pronounce  "UPS" as "ups", then I would be making it an acronym. So you're right, in Spain R.E.M. is an acronym, but here in the states it's usually an initialism. Similarly, I've heard "REM sleep" pronounced as both. That doesn't mean REM is neither an acronym nor an initialism, it can be both! It just depends on the speakerI just think it's safe to say that most people pronounce VLC as V-L-C, making it (commonly) an initialism. But I mean, [anything's an acronym if you try hard enough](https://youtu.be/KljoV87HkkI)

8 You can't revoke old licenses unless it explicitly says you can. So the old source code would be licensed under the GPL v2 forevermore. That doesn't stop the millions of euro payment having clauses attached to it though, like being barred from working on any project that stems from the original codebase. So /u/Heknarf's idea probably wouldn't work.You could also lose the trademark, so you'd need a new branding. But that wouldn't have been too hard to deal with honestly.
1 He's already released the code under open source licenses though. You can't undo that. He just needs to use the code from his last release, and then work from that. 
6 See, that's what it's all about. If a company wants to give you millions for no good reason you take those damn millions. 
1 There are things in life other than money, true. But there's also money, and money helps with things in life. 
41 The south has all the guns and all the barrels.
10 They exist, just pretty rare. Claire-Louise for girls is one of the more common ones in the UK.
9 Ricky Bobby
19 Some do! Example: Mary-Jane.
1 They have in the Netherlands, but it's uncommon nowadays. Jan-Peter (our previous prime minister), Jan-Willem, Willem-Alexander (our king). 
1 Not just in the south if the US. I live in South Africa and (talking about English speakers here, not Afrikaans) I know a few people with double-barrelled first names. My mother, for example.Edit: *used to live
1 Its very rare for guys. You may hear names like Ricky Bobby, but that's usually a first name and a middle name used together. My first name is Michael-Paul and people constantly say my first name is Michael and my middle name is Paul when in reality I don't even have a middle name. In fact when I enter my name in online forms it rejects it saying there cant be any special characters in the first name. As a result my id, credit cards and bank card names would never match. Over the years I have had cards say, Michael-Paul, Michael Paul, Michael P, Mike P, M Paul, Mike Paul and MP. It took many years to get them all close to the same. Oh and my birthday is Feb 29 which plenty of places will not accept either. 
1 I thought double names weren't uncommon. Like "Theresa Mary May", "Donald John Trump", etc. Or aren't those double names?
1 New York State. Very uncommon, but not unheard of. Most people will just confirm that that's your name and carry on. Side note: Vast majority of people will haven't a damn clue what you're talking about if you mention a double-barrelled name. Most people just call it "two first names".
1 Well south of US was largely colonized by France so one would expect that a legacy from it.

1 > Those who think "bollocks, the old project has a lot of traction, the forked one would never catch up" need to look no further than big open-sourced projects that had most of its collaborators leave in favor of a fork, like OpenOffice to LibreOffice, uBlock to uBlock Origin and so on.A lot of people still go and download OpenOffice. You will be surprised.
1 Maybe. And maybe not. Who knows?
5 Ah, thanks!

1 I can't believe how long it's been a relevant standard - to this day there is some porn that will only open with this app.  Thanks!
1 Oh... I just remembered I haven't updated the android app in over a year...  I suppose I can wait a bit longer for the next release.   Edit:  By the way... will VLC get better UI scaling for 4k monitors?

16 We have a fix upcoming for that.

43 Well, it will get better with age.
1 One reason why the distinction between [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware) is important. Not a guarantee necessarily, but the licencing around free software often makes it much harder to "buy it out", thus securing the future freedom of its users.
5 Ads are annoying, most of the user base will fade away if there will be ads.

1 > Instead of paying $5 to reddit, I'll make a note to donate it to the project when I get home. Especially since Reddit is not open source and censors contentreaching /r/all to spread a certain political message that the CEO's support.
105 Blame my parents.
6 You are welcome.
10 Indeed. :)
74 They don't make money as they are a non-profit. They can continue to support and update it because of donations. Wikipedia is a similar example.
6 The non-profit does not.I created a company that does a bit of consulting and spend most of its time improving the core of VLC. (Consulting time is maybe 25% of our time)
5 lol. There is no secret. I am just very lucky.
3 np
2 Someone said Waffles?I would do anything for bonbons and Waffles.
2 Not at all :)
1 See comment above. I created a company to sustain VLC :)
3 Oh yes, you do. I'm just a normal guy working on a cool project.
1 > Have you considered applying for FCC chairman position?You need to be a US citizen.
2  I cannot judge for others. But for VLC it did not feel right. And it would ruin the player for users.
1 If it’s immoral than capitalism as a concept is immoral. I don’t see how it could be considered ‘wrong’, especially in our current society. People need to make a living, and I’m absolutely sure he has some sort of income (through a second job, or a salary from the non-profit) or did in the past. Not everyone is in a position to essentially work for free, and shouldn’t be shunned for it by saying its wrong. 
4 It would make a worse experience for users. This is a very nice thing to do
3 Monetize, yes. Monetize against the users, no!
2 it's not possible. support for the video player would fall through the floor the second they closed source it, and the second they tried to add advertising code it would just get stripped out by package managers.
4 Eventually the fork would become more popular. 
2 > the best representation of the human spirit, to spend your time creating something that benefits humanityWhile his work is laudable, have some perspective ffs. He works maintaining a video player so people can watch pirated movies. He’s not working towards feeding the hungry or curing cancer. Best representation of human spirit 😂
-2 Are you dumb? I literally said that it's great that it is free. That means I understand it makes a "moral sustainable impact on society", mr IamVerySmart
27 There's nothing wrong with it being free either. This is the kind of stuff a Star Trekesque, post-scarcity society could produce. Things like VLC shatter the "no one would make anything" argument against UBI. 
10 Do you have any idea, if we tried to chart code contributions, how many people made VLC possible in one way or another? Until you understand the virality of free software (GPL) licensing, you won't be able to grasp the number and what that implies for "intellectual property".I suggest starting by listing every on-board codec VLC has and listing the authors. And the authors they relied on.  Have fun.
4 Never.
1 They can, it's just not in their interest.
23 I have some weird photos/video of rule 34 with VLC cones. Someone sent it to me... That was unexpected.
4 > Hey, with the abandonment of MPC, would you ever consider updating your interface functionality to the level of MPC-HC?Sure. File bugreports of what is missing.

77 Define "often"
29 Linux users always make this argument but the amount of open source software available on Windows completely eclipses the open source software available on Linux. 
20 What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
8 Causes more problems than it solves IME. I use Ubuntu for my web servers and tried it for my PC for a year or so but it's just still not good enough imo, back on Windows now. Windows is a POS but it's still more stable than Ubuntu for me and simply less work, some of the open source offerings are great but I don't really have any issues on Windows in that regard tbh and cracks exist.
2 > Incredible, free softwareBZZZZZZZZT thanks for playing. He wrote "incredible" ... 99% of Linux apps need to die in a flaming dumpster fire.
2 > Incredible, free softwareYou missed a word there bud. Sure, free software is available - but it's not always _good_ software.
1 You are correct. I used Ubuntu for awhile but was deterred. I was too lazy and got uninterested. I should give it another try to be honest. 
1 I meant for windows! I am well aware of the power of Linux! 
1 Thank you for doing this, my friend!
1 Me too! And VLC Mobile!
3 You are a hero sir 
2 I say yes everyday for winrar
13 what do you even mean ? how else are you using winrar past trial period, unless you're a pirate
1 if you were me, you mean ... not if you were you.
2 Oh and not just this, you can actually adjust the subtitles on the fly.
11 yes, send nudes with a caption (I love you 3minman) or else a blatant lie!
2 Yes, have the team make the next verision of VLC player have an easter egg is someone types out "jbkempf" on a blank screen when a video isn't playing. Then **AND ONLY THEN** will I, a rando internet person beleive you.
1 No sir. Just wanted to say thanks for me being able to whack it as a teen. 
3 A small municipality of Austin called Del Valle. I work as the help desk guy at the high school and your software has saved guest speaker presentations, student presentations, it’s shown movies about bullying that brought kiddos to tears, it plays all our spirit stuff, our digital signage is tested in it. Our ASL (American sign language) teacher uses it for lots of accessibility purposes and to share videos she makes with the students and staff. VLC is likely the software I have the most confidence in that it will work properly. There’s a reason VLC is on a flash drive in my bag at all times

1 Yes sir.  It was a top ten crypto and is now the top 4 crypto on the heals of litecoin and etherium.  Iota is a 'fee' free non-blockchain crypto that will change the world.Here's a simple guide I put together and there are also video links at the bottom of the post that talk about iota and crypto in generalhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/74do7x/getting_started_with_the_tipbot_fast_a_guide_for/edit. Iota also allows you to move funds and tip people on social media platforms fee free.
1 I don't know what VLC is but I'll send you beer! 
1 Mince ! Si tu reviens dans le coin, franchement ce sera avec plaisir !
1 Well not beer, the suggested donation amount to VLC. I guess you can't convert that to beer ;_;Damnit, I wish I actually didn't say anything/had something cooler to say to the dude behind one of my most often used pieces of software. Thanks once again for developing VLC. It really did take me out of the dark ages of video on my computer with having to install codecs manually and getting fuckloads of players for different encodes and whatnot. 
1 Ah bah voilà! What’s your favorite? I can deliver it wherever you want :p
7 I think I will. I was just joking, since the German Pirate Party is pretty much a non-entity on a state/national level here. I know they're doing good work in the European Parliament.
3 There's a good chance there will be also Czech Pirates in the next elections as they got over 10% in our national election couple weeks ago :)
9 >IT for the general population is Facebook and Youtube.Which is my point.>Have the European Union pay for products we use?Or create a state funded open-source foundation that works similar to the Max Plank Institute on a European wide level.  >When have "societal plans" ever worked?Oh for fuck sake. The typical "any form of clear organization is evil, only organization done for the sake of pure profit is good". There's way too much of that going around, especially in Eastern Europe.You live in a legal-financial environment which directs everything from corporate management styles, investment behaviours, intellectual property priorities and employee rights regarding private work. The economic system you live in isn't happening in some sort of purist void. The fact that you're letting go of control on that because of a distaste for "societal plans" only means it fall into the hands of corporate lobbyists.
5 > Have the European Union pay for products we use? Yes, a lot via tax evasion used by those company.
1 Why not ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

3 Nothing to do with believe in saints then?
1 If I remember correctly, cresco in Latin means to grow which is where the words you mentioned come from.
1 Well now you've just taken all the fun out of it.
8 But they usually make you sign a contract forcing you to stay away from similar (not even *the*, but all somewhat related) software for a long, long time.For example, if Musk sold Tesla, there would be a clause saying he can't work in car or battery related companies or projects for a decade. 
1 Would such a clause be enforceable though? I don't think you can prevent people from working on what they want...
3 But what is when you don't need millions?

5 How many people usually come to conferences like this?
2 Can’t y’all just come to America, say.....Atlanta Georgia? Obviously kidding. Thanks for all you do!
2 Shit, I was in Paris precisely during those days and hadn't heard of this. I would have a cool hat now if I had. （ ´Д｀）
1 Interesting but this link is blocked for me as it shows up on two blocks lists. list.7.adblock.mahakala.is.domains list.preEventHorizon

2 what? reddit needs money to keep the servers running
1 Alternatively, give 5$ to reddit only if you feel reddit has provided you with at least 5$ of entertainment and want to "reward" them for being less ad-heavy and paywall-obsessed than many other currently-popular sites.
3 Does it really ? You got any source on that ?

31 DAMN YOUR PARENTS FOR RAISING AN INDIVIDUAL WE CAN ALL ASPIRE TO BE LIKE
2 What did they do? 
43 A non-profit can still make money to cover expenses like paying its employees, it doesn't necessarily mean that they have no income.
1 Gotcha, I appreciate your response
2 I think a large portion of reddit thinks capitalism is fundamentally immoral, which is part of why I asked him the question. 
1 I'm aware of that. And users would have the freedom of not using their software. But that's not what I'm asking. Why is it not "right?" I don't think it's wrong wanting to get paid for a work you've spent hours on.
6 Probably.
1 I mean, I would think creating something like a video player for free *is* the best representation of the human spirit, if the alternative is to gouge you for money... but I was speaking more to FOSS projects as a whole. I really do believe that FOSS projects are an important part of our culture. Just because this particular one does something "simple" doesn't mean that it's not a good representation of the human spirit. I didn't claim the dude was changing lives or anything
1 I think that assuming something should be charged for as a default is dumb but to each their own. Sorry for ruffling your feathers.
7 "proof or gtfo"?
1 KenM trolling or being an asshole trolling?
2 Oh, and by the way, thank you for all that you've done.

47 You'd be surprised how good free and open source software really is. Unless you have some very specific and narrow use-cases, I assume you'd be amazed at how good free software really can be, all without sacrificing usability and privacy. For most home users I'd whole-heartedly advice people to at least give [Solus Linux](https://solus-project.com/) a try
5 Often ~ most
1 #often[aw-f*uh* n, of-*uh* n; awf-t*uh* n, of-]##adverb1. many times; frequently:  *He visits his parents as often as he can.*2. in many cases.
1 Depends on your preferences. I'm in IT, have been using Linux for 20 years and am forced to use Mac OS until I've "arrived" in my new job. My response would be "always" for now.
12 A larger % of software is open source on Linux, but there definitely aren't more in terms in sheer quantity. 
17 Do you think so?I use both Windows and Linux equally, but am struggling to think of a single example of open source software available on Windows that isn't also available on Linux
8 Just comparing the number of open source packages for each platform is pointless. What matters is the amount of *good* open source software, and you'll find that most of those programs are cross-platform, barring ones that are restricted to one due to architectural problems.
4 On the plus side, Linux users don't have to use a broken proprietary operating system. You can choose whether you want a bleeding edge crazy fast, crazy unstable operating system or a rock solid 10 ten years uptime but totally boring OS. Plenty of options in the middle, and if you get bored, just change it. Don't like the way it looks, just install a new and completely different desktop environment. To summarise, ner ner ne ner ner.

3 Does it really, though? There's also the consideration that open source windows programs are often Linux ports and integrate poorly, while on Linux you can stick to one ecosystem(Qt or GTK) for near seamless integration. Even if you mix them, it'll be nicer than in Windows.
2 Maybe, maybe not. But on Linux I use the software manager for 99% of my needs. It works like a charm and keeps all my software up to date. 
1 True, if you put in the effort to find it. So the comment I replied to 'hard to come by' is true to a certain extend. For the sake of the argument some made up numbers: if there are on Linux 50k open source software projects available, and 1k commercial ones, then finding commercial software on Linux requires an effort. On the other hand if there are on Windows 2kk commercial ones a 100k open source ones then it's relatively harder to find the open source ones on Windows out of the combined available stack of software projects.
21 please tell me this is a copypasta and you didn’t spend time typing that out
15 What you're referring to as *windows*, is in fact, Microsoft™ Windows™ 10™ Pro™, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Windows+10. Windows is not an operating system, but rather an opening in a wall, door, roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light, sound, and air, and is made from a non-crystalline amorphous solid that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage.
1 Ganoo?
0 damn its been like 3 years since i read this.../g/ood times 
5 > Windows is a POS but it's still more stable than Ubuntu **for me** and simply less workYeah, it really depends on what you're doing with it. I installed Linux Mint for my mother and my grandpa and I no longer have to fix their "issues". There's just so much more unexpected behaviour on Windows. And Linux package managers are way more straightforward than updates and software (un)installation on Windows.
3 I've never had stability issues with Linux Mint.
2 Usually my experience too. About every year I'll tell myself that I'll give Linux an honest chance. Then I run in to some bug that ruins it. I've tried helping package maintainers fix them but it's like I can't get anyone bothered enough to work with me. Then it becomes way too much effort...
1 Maybe if you're used to calling applications "apps". People like you are guilty of Gnome. In reality, it's probably more like 75%. The difference between the two numbers is also the amount of really good Linux applications.

0 Noncompetes are bullshit and hardly enforceable. Imagine spending 10, 20 years of your career in a particular industry, then signing away your right to work in that industry after you leave a job. You wouldn't be able to get another job after that. They're actually illegal in California and no dev I know, or myself, would ever agree to a noncompete as condition for anything. [source](https://www.hrexaminer.com/is-your-non-compete-agreement-enforceable/)
1 You'd general give the money over time, under the condition that requirements are met. But yes it's enforceable in many situations. You'll find that often companies are sold with the CEO getting a chunk of money but only if they stay working for X years.It's a civil suit, but a contract is a contract. As long as someone can pay, you can sue them.If you leave work without the notice you promised you can be restricted from working for a new company and can be sued for lost sales etc. Really, a lot is possible via contracts.
5 Everyone needs millions. 
1 Uh, well I'm not Afrikaans myself – like I said I'm from the English speaking community – so there could be some cool factoids I just don't know. Most first names are just Dutch (Arno, Jan, Koos) names or are now English names (Chris, Ben, David) Surnames are fairly interesting. Because of the large population of French Hugenots that fled to South Africa *a lot* of the most common Afrikaans surnames are in fact French, for example: "du Plessis", "du Mont", "Theron", "de Villiers".

2 Yeah; if Elon Musk can be a professional hat salesman, I'm sure these guys can as well.
1 Well, yes, but then again the licensing would allow for easy creation of a bloat-free fork, which makes that model less attractive for free software than for freeware (and if it does happen, poeple can still use and maintain the bloat-free version ... if VLC decided to add adware, Debian, say, probably would continue distributing a version with the adware ripped out).

23 Yes it just means that they make no profit as the name implies
5 > A non-profit can still make money to cover expenses like paying its employeesI was gonna use this to ask about the difference between a nonprofit and a not-for-profit organisation, but decided to just google myself, cuz why not?>Nonprofit Versus Not-for-ProfitA not-for-profit organization (NFPO) is a widely based term that encompasses all organizations that are known more specifically as nonprofits, charities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs) and private voluntary organizations (PVOs). It is sometimes more accurate to use the term “not-for-profit” to place emphasis on the organization having the defining criterion of an intention to provide goods and services without seeking profits for private gain. A nonprofit – more broadly a not-for-profit – organization typically makes a profit, either from time-to-time or on a regular basis. This organization uses this profit, however, to further the operations of the organization itself and ultimately to facilitate the provision of benefit to the public at large. The difference between “nonprofit” and “not-for-profit” is largely a matter of semantics. While some groups can use both terms interchangeably, a distinction between the two is that a not-for-profit is an activity that is not intended to generate any profits, such as taking pictures for personal use, while "nonprofit" references an entire organization whose operations/products are not intended to generate a profit (an organization that offers free photography classes).
1 I mean, he explained it though. They are able to work on it and keep it updated due to donations. Obviously it takes money to run a business, even a non-profit, but they don't "make money" off of it per se. There is no profit, hence non-profit. Donations pay wages of the, I am guessing, small team that works on it. 
1 It is in the sense that morality isn't taken into account into capitalism.
5 It is not right as it would decrease the quality of a product many people have worked on over the years to create software that millions can enjoy using. Not everything is about money.
1 The alternative isn’t to gauge you for money. The alternative is to charge a reasonable price lol. It’s not either absolutely free and they’re an amazing benevolent purpose, or they are a greedy asshole exploiting everyone for money. There is s middle ground here. 
1 Why do you insist on arguing against things I never said? I was simply replying to someone that said charging for the product makes you a "corporate boot lick", which I disagree with 
3 "Honestly, I'm just not that invested in you."
1 Dunno waht is KenM trolling.

28 There's so much ridiculously good, free software for media, gaming (emulators etc), graphic design/art, CAD/CAM stuff, animation, the list goes on. That's just on windows too.
2 Actually, if you have very specific and narrow use cases, Linux and OSS is often the way to go. Building an environment around your workflow can be a huge amount of work, but you'll never hit an actual brick wall like with closed source software.

1 I think that's the issue for most people when it comes to Linux. Most people don't "get bored" of their OS and don't really care how it looks. Like, at all. As long as it runs the few business and entertainment programs it needs that's really all that matters.

9 > The general population doesn't need anything but those two and the occassional job search website. When they do need it the service they desire is usually easily found on www.google.com with their trusty Internet Explorer.I guess you don't realise that universities are being flooded by private companies trying to get specialists to use their proprietary tools as the foundation of their education. Or that open-source is getting out-competed in government contracts for things from word processors to tax management because a company that repackages  their own supermarket software as "whatever you want" has more money to spend on presentation. You can't possibly know that, because then you wouldn't be completely ignorant of how much proprietary software has a stranglehold on every section of your life from your electrical bills, to the wifi you connect to in the coffee shop, to the employee management systems sold to HR departments. And all of them are leaking data, despite best attempts to stop it.>Yes, we must do everything possible and take it away from the corporate lobbyists, if we are to return to the glory of the 80's!Why don't we privatise the health services and the army, clearly that's also a stepping stone to communism. The American government shoves billions of DARPA and shits out SpaceX and Boston Dynamics. Meanwhile people like you abhor such things and turn our countries into Africa, because the idea that maybe the problem with communism was the autocratic management not the principle of state organisation in itself doesn't seem to strike.

If I sold a software product or company for 400 million (like YouTube) I would gladly sign it.
1 Non-complete agreements are, at minimum, civil lawsuits. You can be sued for loss of revenue. So if you were paid a chunk of money to agree to it and violate it, then you could be forced to pay that money back if you broke the contract and it stopped their venture being profitable.Beyond that you get a lot of protection if you need to work to survive etc. So they only really work for wealthy individuals or really large payoffs.

29 No, iirc the thing he got propositions for was to bundle adware (≠ regular ads) with the installer.There's nothing wrong with earning money with your software, and I have no problems with non-obnoxious ads.
1 No.
13 non-profit only means that the company can't make money for its owners (shareholders).but they of course are allowed to make a profit as a company.one of the most lucrative non-profits i know is the highly corrupt fifa. they basically print money. all the profits are not payed out to owners, but redirected into an internal rainy day fund that is worth billions. and i'm guessing that fund got a lot bigger because of the world cups in russia and qatar.
8 Which most people don’t understand at all. A company like amazon could be non-profit if they just invested all their money back into the company in the form of infrastructure or higher salaries. Big businesses do this already anyways, to reduce their tax liability (though they claim some profits). 
2 Well, their goal isn't to make a profit.
0 > Yes it just means that they make no profit as the name impliesThe entity which own's Rolex is a charity/Not-for-profit and does not pay corporate tax !
1 I guess that depends on what they meant by "you" then. VideoLan the organization might not make money (read: profit), but the individual team members still can.
1 The point is that it's not a business.
1 I suppose that's true
3 >Not everything is about money.I agree, but it has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not asking why he shouldn't make money off of it, I'm asking why he thinks it's wrong.
2 The headline literally says "refused tens of millions of euros". Doesn't sound like much of a middle ground. The guy chose benevolence over being a greedy asshole. I stick with the "best representation of the human spirit" hyperbole.

24 Sure, but specifically for design and cad, I doubt there's something out there that could match and replace AutoCAD, Premiere, and Photoshop.
1 Totally agree. What kind of suggestions do you have for graphic design/art?
2 I was mostly thinking about stuff like games that don't work well on Wine/Lutris, design stuff like Photoshop, video editing etc. I don't think its controversial to say free/open source software is lacking here, although progress is being made.

2 The reason propriety software is outcompeting freeware, is because propriety software can afford to hire full-time professionals. [Bill Gates addressed this in 1976](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists) It's not just "presentation". All of them are leaking that, because nothing is secure and free or not, the data shall be leaked. Still, it has allowed companies to compete in creating the best service available, where "quality" has never really been much a requirement for a government project.>Why don't we privatise the health servicesWouldn't make our healthcare any worse tbh. >America shoves billions of DARPA Actually I support DARPA - as well as ESA / CERN - but that's R&D. 
1 I'm not using VLC. 
1 got it
1 Putain, devant Macron. Si ça c'est pas la classe?!?
1 :D
1 Thanks, I've been looking forward to trying vlc 3.0 features.
7 I will fly to Paris just for that hat. 
1 That's a very tempting proposal.
11 I've not seen it but I'm imagining it's the story of how he was smart, a description of his accomplishments and their lasting impact on the world and your personal life. His crusade to make information, such as academic writing free. A description of how he did so with a large trove of academic writing. His being charged by the USA for violations of the CFAA and his eventual hounding by the legal system that ultimately ended in his suicide.After his death his actions were basically declared legal by a law informally named after him [Aaron's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act#Aaron_Swartz)
1 I mean just breaking the law doesn't really count as ethics...More respecting people more than the value of money.
19 Exactly.
2 He explained it. VLC isn't something he created. It was created as a streaming TV service in his schools campus by students long before he even arrived there.He "merely" improved and shared it with the world.
1 The headline is hyperbole with no basis. It’s complete speculation as to how much money he could have made. But at least you admit that the human spirit claim is also hyperbole. Also he license of the project he joined on to after it had been built specifically forbids monetizing it lol. He chose to work on the project which is great, but people are acting like he had millions in cash thrown at him and just said “no thanks”. 
1 Trolling for fun, yes. And lately on Brexit to my UK friends.
17 will do. thanks for the link
8 Done. I sometimes forget I have a stable income nowadays, why not spend some of it on good software I use daily?
1 I've used VLC for years but never donated.That's corrected now, thanks for the push.
1 Plus, just discovered you get an amazing cone!
3 Yup, did this myself a few months ago.

4 What's supposedly shady with Paypal?..
2 So I've been told 4 times.
2 I was talking about yours. Makes more sense than someone physically sending you beer.
3 €10,000,00.  Drunk european him doesn't notice. 
1 Not yet!
1 of course, i think you’ll be getting a few of them! thank you so much for building free software!
1 They're just so sweet. The sweetness usually stops me from getting completely hammered. Switching to a different beer after the kasteel though...
1 It's garbage, but I miss it haha
11 Office software is lacking too.
4 Yeah it's doubtful, but that's why those are £££ and the free ones are free. I just like how people have more opportunities to try out different things before they have to spend a boatload on software.
1 I see. Those are actually the reasons I still mainly stick to Windows, but I don't find gaming and photoshopping very specific and narrow use cases.But I've found automating frequent tasks much nicer to set up on Linux rather than Windows, and there's a ton of variety in everyday programs like music players and so forth. On Windows you have MusicBee and Foobar2000 as customisable players, on Linux there's a dozen projects which are similar in scope, not to mention mpd. As such I could organise and enjoy my music just the way I wanted on Linux, while on Windows I just stick to Spotify and kinda cope with it... Though at least I can run beets on Windows.
1 For games you are right, although you can run many Windows games on Linux. But it requires a bit of an effort.As for Video/Graphical software: there are amazing open source alternatives available that are often used by professionals (e.g. the Gimp, blender, ...).
1 https://images.encyclopediadramatica.rs/5/5a/G_draws_Mac_user_from_memory.jpg
1 Ah ouiiiiiiii? :p
5 >Actually I support DARPA - as well as ESA / CERN - but that's R&D.And what do you think an publicly founded open-source foundation providing and updating software libraries for public use would be? Nothing would prevent you taking those libraries, slapping a GUI over it, and then charging a customer a fee for providing tailored support and customisation for their use-case. It isn't socialism or some sort of tyrannical monopoly on software development. It's just common sense in a field that works on mathematical and algorithmic concepts stolen from publicly funded research and benefits from locking in customers by limiting compatibility, not just between software but between software/hardware versions (looking at you Siemens!).  The alternative to 80's communism isn't some cyberpunk-like notion of corporate oligarchy. And trust me they do not "compete in creating the best service available", the word is always "lock-in", and their software is completely inscrutable unlike public work so fuck quality. You have an unhealthy amount of trust in private companies, you should try your hand in software development, that'll shake the illusion quick.

13 Always tell the address currency. A shit ton of crypto get lost because of wrong addresses
8 Thanks for the address, and a Segwit address too! I'm going to make a mental note to contribute soon.A quick Google shows me this is in fact their address:https://www.videolan.org/contribute.html
8 One thing is that they hold people’s money for various lengths of time before depositing it into their bank accounts, making unknown sums of profit on all the money held in such a way at any given moment.Another is that they have been known to close people’s accounts without warning and without recourse, taking any money in the account.All issues with PayPal are compounded by their virtually non-existent customer support that is incredibly difficult and time consuming to navigate.
40 Oh sweet summer child...
6 Short version, they aren't regulated like banks, but people use them like a bank, so there have been a *lot* of cases of people just not having access to their own money.     Another really shitty thing is that they just don't like the adult entertainment industry, to the point that if you're a porn star, cam girl, etc, they will just close your account and ban you. Had money in there? lol, not any more, it's theirs now. Weren't even using the account for adult stuff? Too bad, there's no recourse. They just don't consider adult entertainers to be people who should have access to financial services.     There's also a lot of incidents of people who have had increases in usage suddenly find their accounts locked for an undetermined amount of time. People using it as a payment option to start their small business suddenly find they have no access to their only source of income for months at a time, with no idea when they might see their own money. Obviously when a business starts up, they see an increase in cashflow, and if it gets frozen for any amount of time, the business is completely fucked. Lots of small businesses have been destroyed by this. 
3 LOL
3 I think he meant Bitcoin, which easily can be used for money laundering.Edit: uh-oh I said this in the middle of large cryptocurrency circle jerk group.. Edit 2: pls send help
1 That does sound pretty Microsoftish...
1 I always get trapped.
17 That really depends on your needs. In my business everything happens in LibreOffice, and there might be features I'm not familiar with in MS Office, but not sure what that could be. Btw, the Gimp comes pretty close to Photoshop for many users.
1 > I see. Those are actually the reasons I still mainly stick to Windows, but I don't find gaming and photoshopping very specific and narrow use cases.Well, for most people I assume they mostly consume content and not create it so in that perspective, its kind of narrow. Even still there exists entirely good alternatives to photoshop and various video editors, but for advanced users this software might be lacking (thus a narrow use case). 
1 You should check out Solus, as I've said. The Steam integration is really, really good making Steam a hassle-free experience on Solus. In addition, it includes Lutris which comes with Wine pre-configured so that many Windows-only games also run; Overwatch for example has its own Lutris config but sadly I cannot run that as AMD GPU's and Wine apparently don't mix that well
1 I'm not an anarchist, a minarchist or a libertarian. I just see no reason for the government to start financing personal operation - least of which is VLC. Not to mention that this is going to end in nepotism and buddy-buddy deals - as always. Just because the government can, doesn't mean it should. Because of this right now VLC competitors - one of which I am using - are going to have to compete with a government funded operation. I would also like to point out that video players is one of the few instances where freeware won out, so having big government contracts flying around is a massive step back. >And what do you think an publicly founded open-source foundation providing and updating software libraries for public use would be? But that is not what is happening (and frankly, is it that bad that it should be happening?), what is going on is that the E.U. is paying VLC to improve its service. Bugs found in it wouldn't necessarily translate to other services.

2 I think the only really irreplaceable MS Office program is Excel. Haven't found a free variant that I can use for financial spreadsheets yet.
2 Gimp doesn't have CMYK support, other than that is a good software, as far as I know there isn't any professional level editing software, but on the other end there is Blender that is simply an awesome 3D software used by many professionals and studios
1 You see the problem with using open source in an enterprise scenario is you're generally lacking in support, there's missing features that some users require etc etcI try to utilise as much open source software as possible in my role (Testing) but often there is no alternative to something like HP UFT, in the testing space. Or perhaps a better, and more common, example is Excel. There's so many features in Excel that are so integral for many large businesses that there really is no alternative.
3 And you think private companies don't involve nepotism and buddy-buddy deals? Listen, I'm not saying that it would a divine place lacking in corruption, but the Max Plank institute works, as does ICANN, W3C,  IANA, and many other organizations making the world you know work without asking for anything but running-money in return.  The whole software development industry is founded on government funded software, research and standard organisations and that stops just short of the public that is supposedly supposed to benefit from it.And VLC is not a personal operation. It's open source, meaning anyone can contribute to it,verify it and profit from using it. It's a public operation done for the public good. And they have to fight off patent trolls trying to sink them, pay for their own operational expenses and try to beg for money from their minuscule aware community while the owners of Windows Media Player are having champagne on the beach.>But that is not what is happening (and frankly, is it that bad that it should be happening?), what is going on is that the E.U. is paying VLC to improve its service. Bugs found in it wouldn't necessarily translate to other services. Consider for a moment, that of those "other services" it might include: People using VLC to look at endoscopy videos, schools using it to show examples in class or play recorded lectures, basically any use of video in society. And yes, it's definitely "that bad".  My field is automation where a few companies have completely taken over and developments are worrying. Security holes aren't being plugged, millions are wasted dealing with their software  compatibility issues, they push their way by bundling their products together and undercutting competition, and they poach some of the brightest people young so they can use them up before they have any idea what they want to do with their lives. We will likely never replace them, because they're so embedded into the industry that they can force any competitor out by obfuscating their hardware specs and communication protocols, causing compatibility issues with open source software,  getting government support over their security issues because they run nuclear power plants and water treatment with their stuff, and generally being a giant tick on the body economic.Like I said, IT is broken. 
1 You really are that guy?
6 Yea. Imagine a world were penny stocks did not exists and then almost over night they came into existence but nobody knew what they were. Some people caught on early and were able to buy massive amounts of them and prop up the market when demand surged. The new cool thing is these new pump and dumps (the other cryptos) are taking off and riding the "next" Bitcoin hype train until they fizzle.This is just my opinion of course. But cryptocurrency looks a lot like most pump and dump penny stocks with the million reasons why it is going to be the next big thing and the little info-graphics they make about them etc.
2 that's the helpful reddit spirit at work
2 I mean, it takes literally 5 seconds to use Google.But here you go: [PayPal fined $25 million for shady business practices.](https://news.avclub.com/paypal-fined-25-million-for-shady-business-practices-1798279810)
1 Not really, no. He created x.com, which merged with the company that became known as PayPal. He was ousted as CEO in 2000 due to fighting with other directors. Maybe he took issue with PayPal's horrendous business practices.
4 They also pretty quickly get shady law firms involved if there's something wrong with your account. 
2 Isn't that every bank (but to an lesser extend).
3 Bitcoin the corporation and 4chan the hacker right?
2 Ye I agree, especially if you are using it on an advanced level.
2 I've done pretty serious financial stuff in LO, never missed anything, though some functions are named differently. Do you have any specific functions on your mind that are missing?
1 > And you think private companies don't involve nepotism and buddy-buddy deals? Of course they do, but when they go overboard they fail - and that's a good thing. A lot of "big" companies have gone out of business in the last twenty years. >And VLC is not a personal operation. It's open source, meaning anyone can contribute to it,verify it and profit from using it. It's a public operation done for the public good.But this isn't funding open source libraries, this is funding bug fixes. >And they have to fight off patent trolls trying to sink themAs does every other major open source operation, why should the VLC be special? >Consider for a moment, that of those "other services" it might include: People using VLC to look at endoscopy videos, schools using it to show examples in class or play recorded lectures, basically any use of video in society.Again, why should VLC be prioritize? I will not comment about the automation industry, since I've never worked in it. EDIT: I do understand where you're coming from, but the way I see it this just gives VLC an unfair competitive advantage and it's a test-pilot for yet another system of politicians funneling money to their friends. I think we understand each other, it's just that we're coming to different conclusion with the same data.
3 "X is Y""I haven't heard that, how is X Y?""Ha, this idiot doesn't think X is Y! I'm so much smarter than him!"Redditors are in no way more concerned with one-upping each-other than with actually communicating, I promise.
0 It took you literally 5 seconds to post a smug non-answer too.I have more sympathy for the guy that asks a question instead of googling than I do for the guy that knows the answer but chooses to mock the guy asking the question instead of answering it.  If you feel like answering a simple question is beneath you, why did you feel it was crucial to respond at all?
6 They freeze accounts at random  for months at a time and invest those funds ... banks don’t freeze at random Also they always favour the buyer so easy to defraud the seller d with PayPal If want to
1 > the way I see it this just gives VLC an unfair competitive advantageYou do know that if you wanted to you could fork VLC, rename it and sell it, as long as you publish your code? So you can benefit from the bug fixes and still produce a competitive product. Or simply reverse engineer it, write it back from scratch and don't publish at all. Not like it matters because open source hardly has the money to sue you if you just steal everything, which is another problem on top of the rest. [Here's the code](https://github.com/videolan/vlc).And you're way too focused on VLC and this specific early program. I've said my peace somewhere else that it isn't enough, and that's that.> it's a test-pilot for yet another system of politicians funneling money to their friendsIf all you think government can do is "funnel money to their friends" then you're fucked. I know eastern europe teaches people to expect that, but unless we want to be an extension of Africa we've got to expect more. Which is why I want an actual public foundation, with independent management and accounting, not what is currently available.
3 *Now i'm gonna downvote you for no reason whatsoever! * - a redditor probably
1 one upping people and making shitty puns, especially if that pun somehow relates to a meme that appears in every thread. but actually answering a question? pff, why? and of course if you ask how X is Y, it's not that you're just asking, obviously you're just a troll who doubts the credibility of the statement.
1 Someone piss in your cheerios there, mate? 
3 Look, it's simple, Reddit Karma is an objective metric of your value as a person, and if you don't know a thing that someone else knows, regardless of how obscure or inconsequential that thing may be, you are beneath them, and your Karma score will reflect that.If karma was about 'Participating in a Discussion' the person asking a question would be up-voted, and the person smugly not answering it would be down-voted. Since "HURR GO GOOGLE IT" is a karmic goldmine of a comment, then Karma must really be about who has the largest collection of 'facts' on hand!
1 Ummm, there are more words in this comment than "You are 100% right and know more than me." So I have no choice but to assume you're arguing with me.
2 Well, you have more comment karma than me so you must be right.

20 My favorite:  The old woman in Fort Worth who, thinking there may be a burglar around, is blasting away at her detached garage with a six-shooter as the cops arrive.  The cops settle her down, find her box of ammo, RELOAD HER PISTOL for her, place the piece back on her nightstand, and leave.

1 ITT: Everybody linking their favourite COPS episodes. brilliant.
1 Cops has some really absurdist humor in there sometimes.My favorite moment (which I will never find) is that there was some dispute in a convenience store parking lot. The cop asks to check a woman's purse to make sure there's no drugs. It's completely full of knives and she's like "Yeah, that's just my knife collection." It has nothing to do with the dispute, so they just put the knives back and never mention it again.
29 Looked like an episode of reno 911.
6 The Indian guy is definitely one of my favourites https://youtu.be/Vvwx_woiItk
1 It's not Cops, but [traffic cone guy](https://youtu.be/54ZlACtS4Pg?t=3) is a personal favorite.
1 I don't sell crack I'm a prostitute lol 
80 [removed]
18 You guys are way off, fool.https://youtu.be/nzwLDNnqzD0
13 Is there anywhere that I can binge watch cops?
1 "Imma git you bitch" is my favoriteThe moment:https://youtu.be/X2xbLV_NSbkFull video:https://youtu.be/HN9FfLCu1cI
5 If ever there was a "wait for it" moment, this clip is it.  
5 Was this directed by M. Night Shyamalan? 
4 I can't find a link to it but my favourite is when a cop pulls a guy over and issues him a ticket. The guy then rips it up and throws it out the window. The cop tells him he needs to pick up all the pieces or he'd get a ticket for littering too...
1 I saw a documentary about COPS and one of the camera guys talk about the very first night, the very first call they went to was this:[Man high on PCP, burglary in progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmxkC7wN7AE)Which to this day, is my prime example of how lethal force isn't necessary in most cases. They didn't shoot the guy, didn't taser him or put him in a choke hold or beat him with a baton. Just wrestled him down and then handcuffed him. Those cops are the real heroes man. The camera man said after that call, he was really wondering if the show was a good idea. 
3 Ah that's funny.
3 That twist at the end damn near broke my neck. 
1 Definitely this one, gets me in tears[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZV87VmJOS0](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZV87VmJOS0)
1 comedy gold, good enough to be scripted comedy.
1 When the hood is white and a black. 
1 “I dont sell crack-im a prostitute.”
1 Is this Cops or Reno 911?
1 I don’t sell crack, I’m a prostitute 
16 The s*** cops have to put up with...
2 There's an episode of cops where the cops tells a kid he suspects of selling and smoking weed to open his mouth...he does...then proceeds to shine a light into his mouth and says " you've been smoking weed" ..the kid replies "how do you know"....cop replies "your tongue and mouth are green"(Next scene kids in backseat handcuffed)(Commercial break)
2 I saw an episode where the cops where handling some domestic shit and some drunk fuck comes walking out of nowhere from off camera. Some old guy with a red hat. I've never been able to find the clip, but it had me rolling. 
1 Oh my god I really was not expecting that ending 
1 " Top of the line ". https://youtu.be/vv5zStEvQew
1 My favorite is the episode where a cruiser is chasing a pickup through a field.  The cruiser gets stuck in a ditch, catches fire, and burns out of existence.  Boy was that cop embarrassed.
1 I knew what this was from the thumbnail. Truly gold
1 I don’t know if anyone posted it, I can’t find a clip of it, but the GOAT is the white guy caught mid-blowjob from a black prostitute, and the cop informs him the prostitute is actually a man. The look on the white guys face is priceless. 
1 Wasn't expecting the twist at the end
1 Wos. y the look of those lips she sure does smoke
1 Oprah should do a “where they are now” episode on them.
1 She sells crack, just not the kind the lady was looking for.  The kind she sells she can wash and sell again.
1 So basically Reno 911
1 Turn back now, if you get into this thread you will be spending the rest of the night watching one minute "Cops" clips.You'll go "I can watch one more, they are just a minute long."And then you'll look up and realize the day is gone.Then you'll just watch more.
1 Yeah, don’t disrespect me.  Dealing drugs is only the second oldest profession.
1 I thought it couldn't get any better, then she says I don't sell crack I'm a prostitute....lol
1 I don't know what scene it was, and it's been a few hours now so no one will probably see this, but... There was this scene where this random white guy is like strangling a copy with 1 arm and multiple other cops are trying to restrain him. I don't know what the context was because I only saw it in the show intro but holy shit. This regular looking not that bulky guy was a beast. I'd be grateful if anyone familiar with the show could let me know what season/episode that's in if it's an actual segment, because seeing it is always so surreal. 
1 Surely this happened in Florida. (If real)
1 Does anyone have the link to a crack head buying some crack for an undercover cop then pinches it and says "halfers halfers que no"
1 The dumb ones are easy
1 "I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute" I respect how firm she was with her answer. 
1 Better than I could have expected.
1 " I don't sell crack,,, I'm a prostitute " hahaha
1 Trump's base in a nutshell.
1 Its a different world from where we come from.
1 that ending was r/unexpected
1 This was a roller coaster from start to finish.  Absolute masterpiece.
1 My favorite is the cops are called to some small country restaurant. Some customers were upset, I believe because the restaurant wasn't letting them take part of an all you can eat spaghetti order home and they called the cops over it. Something like that, been a long time.
1 "Don't come over disrespecting my child. That's my child. My child! I don't sell crack. I'm a prostitute!"That's gold, Jerry, GOLD!
1 Holy shit. I lived in this neighborhood when this went down. 90s Fort Worth Cops is the best.
2 I don't believe this. It's pure comedy. The acting, the writing. It takes hours to script something as good as this.
1 Classy neighbourhood.
1 It ends with a twist. 
2 LOL
1 Omg Twist!!
1 Ahahahahah
1 The best by far is the scene from "Blood and scars, Bro!" when they find the guy behind the shed. Props to anyone who can link that video. 
1 Nice hood!
1 “I don’t sell crack, I’m a prostitute.”Fucking gold
1 Her lips say she doesn't sell crack, but her lips say she smokes it.
1 Well I’m no expert. But judging from the looks of her lips, she probably just smoked up that crack. 
1 I'm pepper spraying you straight up
1 This wouldn't be out of place in a snowy dimly lit New Jersey.  
1 That Martin shirt though. INEEEEEEEEEDIT
1 Can we all just take a second to appreciate that baller Martin t-shirt?
1 "I don't sell drugs, I'm a prostitute. "r/unexpected
1 The whole video had me like [what](https://gph.is/2lnp32Z) 
1 I dunno man. Can you break those cuffs?
1 Did not disappoint 
1 The one that stood out to me was a guy had been pulled off the street ..cop asked if he had been huffing paint...guy said no but he had all silver paint on his face
1 Did not see that coming
1 Thank sweet Kentucky Fried Baby Jesus for 'Murica. 
1 Sooooo....everyone got arrested then? Lol
1 r/unexpected 
1 I was half expecting the guy with the prostitute to then step forward and say, "She bought the crack from me, this woman is innocent.  I'm a drug dealer."
1 TIL "The Invention of Lying" is based on a true story
1 Wow... at least we can appreciate their honesty, lol.
1 You made my day OP. After months of watching twitchbagz compilation I thought I'd never be surprised. I underestimate people it seems
1 https://youtu.be/NHb2_P1Xd7g
1 That was...  Incredible!
1 That clip just got better and better. 
1 I don’t sell crack I’m a prostitute...damn
1 Can anyone link the clip in which this dude is high on meth in a fast food restaurant making a scene? The cops come and tell him its time to leave and he goes full barbarian rage. Becuase, THAT is my all time favorite. 
1 The ending!
1 If there are any real estate agents that know of homes available for sale in this neighborhood, please let me know. I’m a hooker too and I want my boy to grow up in a proud community of hookers.
1 So for twenty she should have given her a hand job at least...
1 "I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute!" Man, that got me good!
1 I dunno, I kind of find this a little sad, to be honest.
1 R/unexpected would appreciate this video 
1 Is this Michigan? This looks like Michigan
1 Did I just watch "Reno 911"?
1 Don’t get me wrong, I have always been a huge fan of cops and I’ve watched it for a decade now.. but am I the only one who thinks this show could easily be set up and partially fake? That might have sounded dumb but I’ve always had that in the back of my mind watching the show. Sometimes it’s just unbelievable, yet I still put it on over and over again lol
1 You know someone is feeling their oats when they say "child" and "home" instead of "kid" and "house".
1 I was hoping for the one where they go to these hillbillies on a missing child call, and the dude is riding along with the police cruiser on a kids dirt bike or ATV through people's yards. But I can't find it on YouTube :(
1 justarresteveryone...
1 There was one time on cops where there was a domestic violence dispute and one guy stabbed his wife with "The Sharpest Knife in the World" and kept referring to it as that. The cop eventually got a kick out of it and would ask them to repeat what they said for his partner. To this day I can not find that clip and I'm not starting from S01E01 just to find one damn clip.
1 i knew 100% what clip this was wothout even looking at the thumbnail.one of the best moments on television ever!!!
1 My favorite is when the woman comes at the officer with a kitchen knife and gets shoved and falls on the blade. While the officers jump on her and force her into handcuffs showing the bloody hand from self I'm playing herself. Immediate  justice. 
1 Is this actually real 
1 I don’t sell drugs. I’m a prostitute 
1 "Don't disrespect me child.  I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute."  I spit out my coffee at that line.
1 Have you seen the one where [Kevin Hart is trying to break the handcuffs?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhrwC2BoAkE)
1 I actually prefer this one the best. ["I'mma get you bitch!"](https://youtu.be/IdlY3CiY4Zs?t=33s)
1 This one is quite memorable also. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHo3OtRsg5s
1 That plot twist though, jeesus.
1 Ok this is one of my favorite videos from now on.
1 r/unexpected
1 [my favorite cops moment and prostitute sting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3NO1cWOVx0)
1 I don't sell drugs officer. I sell this sweet ass.
1 Say what you want about free market capitalism, but I think we all agree that sheetrock isn't *rock*. 
1 Ahh, now I get how some people are still pro-Trump.
1 [This clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7UX8KASASU) takes the cake for me. From the New Zealand version. 
1 r/unexpected 
1 This should be in r/WTF
1 *Cops* is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
1 [This is still my favorite](https://youtu.be/jhrwC2BoAkE)
1 https://youtu.be/jNMOI9mZGko This is the best cops segment ever. 
1 ...bet that prostitute specializes in "gummers" if ya know what I mean.
1 "I don't sell crack cocaine I'm a prostitute" 
1 Time for a T-Shirt**DON'T DISRESPECT MY CHILD****I DON'T SELL CRACK****I'M A PROSTITUTE**
1 Anyone notice how the second lady was the one who brought up how she wanted to buy crack? Sure sounds like she knew what the $20 was for as well.. 
1 Well, this is absolutely great.
1 I have never been able to find my favorite Cops moment after the first time I saw it. A woman a cop was familiar with turned in front of him while he sat at a red light. He knew she didn't have a license so he turned around and pursued the truck, pulling it over a few blocks later. The cop gets her, and her male passenger out and sits them on the curb while he runs them for warrants. He walks back over, and says he knows she doesn't have a license and asks why she was driving. She replies that she wasn't driving, and the cop stunned by the reply almost laughing asks "What? You weren't driving? Was he?" The guy replies "Nah she wasn't driving, the other guy was."The cop in disbelief says "When I pulled you over it was only you two in the truck." The guy replies "Nah, when you pulled us over the other guy got out and ran through the yards" motioning toward the houses and then asks "can't you here the dogs?" All three listen for the barking dogs to the sound of absolute silence.I was like 15 when I saw that, and I have never been able to find it on YouTube or anywhere else. Maybe one of the fine people reading this post knows where to find it.
1  I see everyone sharing links but [this](https://youtu.be/poat6y9bkbk) is the one I share with all my friends. 
1 I wasn't ready for the ending.
1 How sad is my life that I knew what the clip was before even starting to watch it.
1 One of my favorites is the cops respond to a house fire. They arrive on scene and the cop starts banging on the front door yelling to the occupants that they need to get out because their house is on fire. They dont hear him and the door is locked so he uses his baton to break the windows on the front of the house so he can yell inside and be heard better. After he breaks a few windows backup arrives and lets him know he's at the wrong house. The house on fire was next door haha. 
1 LMAOOO
1 https://youtu.be/jSiIirICPw0This has always been my favorite. "EXCUSEEEE MY BEAUTYYYYYY".
1 Haha that was great! I was like "damn this crackhead bothering this family" oh wait she a hooked and probabaly did sell her fake crack.
1 Nothing will surprise this cop. 
1 She sells butt crack haha
1 One of my faves. It's better when you are watching the entire segment and don't expect the guy to just walk up.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jlnKjocf8dY
1 ...wait for it.....
1 This is a real wild ride, start to finish. 
1 Everyone has a hustle
1 What about https://youtu.be/rUp6M1-0gQk
1 It's good, but not quite as good as [this one...](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JTNcSKycCvQ&t=55s) 
1 This belongs to r/Unexpected
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPfK53HBORY
1 https://youtu.be/xZtfeGi7VFA?t=48'stoners get robbed' is a classic too.
1 I'm fucking dead 
1 “I don’t sell crack, I’m a prostitute.”  Classy
1 I don’t sell crack im a prostitute 
1 She sell's a different kind of "crack"...
1 That Martin shirt is fucking fuego. 
1 Of course it’s in Fort Worth, TX.
1 "I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute"......frickin' hierarchy here mofo
1 idk why but I started LOLing before I even clicked on the link (I also lol'ed during the clip)
1 "I don't sell crack I'm a prostitute" 🤣🤣🤣
1 Wow, the writers of Reno 911 sure had it easy
1 I literally had to leave after 28 seconds
1 If M. Night Shyamalan directed a COPS segment
1 How dare that bitch say i sell crack? Does she not have any couth. I would never ever sell crack. Wtf do I look like? A low life? Jesus ChristI’m a prostitute for gods sake
1 Nobody would believe this story if it wasn't caught on film. Legendary. 
1 https://youtu.be/CcShXtgsMJkI think your nickname is doodoo. you are nawt... gonnadothat. 
1 ACAB
1 I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute. 
1 My favorite cops moment. https://youtu.be/Q9Co2iH44ugLove how he starts climbing the light pole after his attempted escape.
1 My favorite is when the black midget tried escaping the cops by climbing a telephone pole 
1 Waiting for a matehttps://youtu.be/JG2loM1_le8
1 Good old east fort worth.
1 https://youtu.be/Vvwx_woiItkMy all time favorite. Has me on the floor laughing
1 “I don’t sell crack I’m a prostitute”
1 ...when that bass drops...
1 Holy shit why have I never seen this? Love the Martin shirt!
1 Does anyone have the clip of officers being called to assist a mom who has a kid calling her a fag? Officer Maroney says, "your mom's not a fag, shes your best friend."PLEASE
1 Not a Cops! One but one of my all time faves.Reminds me of the front fell off video.https://youtu.be/17vKgrKQu20
1 I really wanted to laugh at this, but it’s such sad commentary on how normalized poor degraded behavior has become. I really wanted to laugh… but I just feel a little bit more depressed.
1 She sells crack...just not the type the lady was looking for.
1 You guys have named pretty much all the best and my favorite COPS moments...this one was left out though!https://youtu.be/poat6y9bkbk“Call me Papi one more time!”
1 Omg this was the best!  Ahahaha!
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXjme42yeQ8 Benny is my favorite
1 Everybody needs a side hustle.
1 I personally like the [very polite vampire] (https://youtu.be/B3xn2T2qbFg) or [this gentlemen who just wants to know wtf is you sayin](https://youtu.be/ea4uN6OWkcY)
1 Since we're sharing our favorites, [mine is the one where the crack head gets arrested after trying to outrun a cop who has a prosthetic leg](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHav4RQibk)
1 Plot twist. 
1 That took a sharp turn I did not expect. 
1 Loving all the favorite Cops video posts!
1 I would like to say thank you to everybody who posted 30 minutes worth of their best COPS clips. Some of us know who the real hero's are. Thank you. 
1 Some straight up M night shit at the end
1 [This is the all time best COPS clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5zStEvQew)
1 r/unexpected right there ! 
1 I'll be the roundabout
1 legendary. 
1 Cop turns to other woman: " madam did you see what happened?"Woman 2: " that bitch over there is calling us liars! That is very disrespectful. I am not a liar am a shoplifter!"
1 I think it was from cops but my friend had a sound clip of a woman yelling "Bitch sell crack, bitch sell crack."  I would love to find that again but I never have.
1 The shirt is the icing on the cake 
1 My favorite game to play is to guess if it’s an old episode or just some backwards town. 
1 U/bigardraz it’s literally everyone at work in one video
1 And they were roommates! 
1 People just admitting things left and right up in here. 
1 It's kindof sad actually. This is what their lives are like and it's so normalized  for them that it doesn't seem like a big deal to discuss it openly.
1 Mine:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gPOyub4t2YY
1 I was not expecting that.
1 Why are you so sweaty OP?!
1 When I think of Cops, I think of this.
1 That hooker clearly smokes something look at her lips.
1 Naked guy on dust punches a hole through a fence and tries to climb through it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLZq5GGPxws
1 OMG. Liquid gold. 
1 [My personal favorite ](https://youtu.be/2gBVG-x0lfE)
1 I remember one with a chubby Hispanic kid in a button down shirt who seemed shitfaced.  He kept saying "I am Superman!" And claimed to have drank like 70 beers.  I can't find it anywhere now.
1 I legit lol'd to this holy shite that was hysterical, hey atleast they were honest, gotta respect that!
1 IDONT SELL NUTUING IM A PROSTITUte kek 
1 Literally my reaction at the end https://i.imgur.com/KFkk3s0.jpg Tell me this was staged.
1 The officer should have asked her if she got a receipt.
1 r/Unexpected
1 BWAHAHAHA!!!!!! You can't make this shit up!
1 Proof that trash has no color.
1 The second lady looks like she might have had crack pipe burns on her lower lip. 
1 Cops before they did the on scene cameras sucked ass. Just shitty helicopter cameras of police chases with that guy narrating it. Now they follow cops around and it fucking awesome 
1 Fellow Cops fiends! I’ve been searching for a clip for years and can’t find it online. Location-JacksonvilleA tip comes in the a cook was shown on America’s Most Wanted and he’s currently at a homeless shelter. They find him and call into America’s Most Wanted to get more info. AMW says all the info is on their website. The Cops are amazed! They write down the website “http://www” and then have to find a computer that has internet access. Does anyone have the clip for this?
1 My favorite is: The motherfucker is under the mattress. 
1 I wasn't ready for that plot twist 😂 "I don't sell crack......im a prostitute"
1 Do you hear that? The Screaming of the Lawyers?
1 That m night twist at the end though.
1 She should of just used her white privlage to avoid all that.  
1 Cocaine's a helluva drug.
1 r/unexpected last line 
1 *crazy ass white chick**oh a black chick in the mix**hmm she’s pretty articulate and respectable I like it**oh...*
1 What a fucking whirlwind 
1 I must be getting old. That was just depressing as hell to watch.
1 What about:https://youtu.be/kHo3OtRsg5s
1 Rightfully so. Incredible moment in TV history. 
1 Only America.
1 NIC!
1 THIS is one of the funniest situations on COPS -(Stoners getting robbed)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZtfeGi7VFAThe best part is when he waves the camera with him into the other rooms, like it's an episode of Cribs lol.Edit 2: "Y'know.. That's a really incredible synopsis.. I would say the man appears to be pure evil". Get's me every time hahah.
1 I forgot about the last 2 seconds of this, "I don't sell crack, im a prostitute." She's so proud of herself.
1 It is important to have standards.
1 As a prostitute she sells a different type of crack 
1 Gross
1 I needed that surprise laugh! Thanks for posting!
1 Omg lmao
1 Did I just hear, "I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute?"
1 You are all wrong - this is the best scene from Cops of all time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVo-VjLOK8"GERONIMOOOOOOO!!!"
1 $5 says this is Alabama.
1 Not as good as the Las Vegas midget climbing the street post and doing backflips. Then eventually getting a job at the local strip club. 
1 Is no one going to mention the episode where they do prostitution stings and the cop is dressed as a clown?EDIT: https://youtu.be/p3NO1cWOVx0
1 The Very Polite Vampire FTW - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3xn2T2qbFg
1 And the hooooooooooooome.Of theeeeeeeeee.Buraaaaaaaaaaave.
1 love my hometown Fort Worth 4ever  :)
1 Wow
1 Crack is whack!
1 This video made me apply lip balm
1 It’s all about”I can break these cuffs”https://youtu.be/jhrwC2BoAkE
1 This post is about to be lit with everyone’s best “Cops” segments. 
1 Snickers bar lady is the best IMO
1 Using this
1 That ending... 😂
1 They pulled some old guy over once for drunk driving, and he said "I don't know how you knew to pull me over.  I was doing what I always do when I drive drunk, I put my hand over this eye, and keep this eye on the center line."
1 Hopefully not already posted.  Another good one.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW3PYU5SGFE
1 I can't find the link but my favorite one was where the guy had gold paint all over his face, but swore to God he was not huffing paint.
1 Reminds me of my old neighborhood.  Good times....no not really.   It was terrible. 
1 My favorite, and I'll be honest, I'm too high to search for it, but it's when the guy gets pulled over with a joint in his ear.
1 Funny show when I was a kid, but this stuff just makes me feel uncomfortable now. Like yeah, poor and unstable people are going to be more prone to taking drugs and drinking. Their lives suck and that's what they have at their disposal for reprieve. It's not really that entertaining anymore, just sad. Like that show Bait Car. It just feels wrong. Like what's the surprise about dangling a fat paycheck in the form of a new car in front of a neighborhood of poor people. Of course someone's going to steal it. Would it be funny if there was a show about leaving an attractive woman in the middle of a neighborhood with known sex offenders? Then when one tries to rape her, someone jumps out of a van and slaps the cuffs on them. 'Haha gotcha! Smile for the camera!'Meh
1 Brazilian guy here. Lemme ask you guys a question: this shit is satire, right?Right?
-1 Don't disrespect her chow?Can anyone elaborate?
0 Seriously, thank you for this. This is so ridiculous and funny it should be on SNL.
0 Somebody needs to explain, some cops scenarios are just to funny to be true Now are they real or not??
0 Prostitutes.^The^crack^you^can^sell^over^and^over.^I'll^just^see^myself^out.
0 Did not see that coming
0 I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute.
0 OMG, that was awesome !!! Wait for it... Wait for it... here it comes... BAM!
1 Last I checked prostitutes sell crack as well. Why the prostitute make more money than the drug dealer? Because she can wash her crack and resell it.
1 I can't believe this hasn't been posted...[I'll get you bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_qthhFvxjc)
1 And we wonder how Trump was elected....TBF...would have said the same thing if HRC was elected. So. There’s that...
-4 This is America now
-1 What's a prostoo?
-15 I don't find this funny, Hear the authority in the policeman's voice when he says crack cocane ? That authority doesn't come from God or righteousness, but comes from that he and the power of his guns will put their hands on her and show her harm The power of the sord 
-7 the cop missed a prime opportunity to make comedy gold. he could of turned to the camera and said something like "im actually a heliCOPter soi soi soi soi" 
1 Top of the liiiiineee. That dude is a legend lmfao
1 This one is full of amazing quotes, definitely my favorite. "I'm the loneliest man in Las Vegasssssss". "Watch the brand... no don't cut em" "Top of the line"
271 Oh lord. Vegas cops probably deal with shit like this all the time. 
1 Cop: "yeah nobody wants you"      Guy cries: nobody wants me.... not even a female companion.              Had me dying
1 Holy shit I love how comedic he says it
1 They just kept finding more beer lmao
1 My favorite Vegas suspect is still the short, [muscular guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Co2iH44ug) who thinks he can break the handcuffs... but first, he climbs up a light pole like it's New Year's Eve.*I think he also shows up in another segment, but not certain*  
1 "You got a warrant""No...""Nobody wants you?""Nobody wants me! I am a lonely man"This guy is fucking gold.
1 You could pepper this in-between a couple Reno 911 skits and I wouldn't even bat an eye...
1 Kinda resembles Shatner. 
1 Hey you!*starts chugging beer*
1 I really thought that cop would come up empty handed and embarrassed from fondling panty man, but by God he wasn't joking. There really was another beer in his crotch. 
1 Pretty sure this is actually reno 911. lol, unreal.
1 Says it the same way I do every time my wife takes her pants off. 
1 You know.... Panies.. :)
1 Omg I did not actually expect there to be a second beer
1 "It's a baby bud!" that cop loves his job. 
1 Maybe a combination,  but that dude is gigantic compared to the cop.
1 I laughed out loud pretty much from the time he was howling about getting on his knees to the end. That was amazing. 
1 This is like an episode of Reno 911.
1 "Pannies."
1 Vegas Cops is best cops.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PIzc6qDnh8I love this takedown.
1 Cops are remarkably nice to people like that.
1 He is delightfully insane.
1 Yellow shirts is a terrible choice for police uniform. It feels more "janitor" than "officer of the law".
1 I feel like Im watching Reno 911 in this thread
1 "Top ah the liiiine" holy shit lmao 
1 my favorite quote.."I let these whores in my house to wash their asses, and I'm the bad guy?"
1 Props to the cop for actually parking his car on the center median.  I’ve seen so many cops that pull people over or just park their car in a regular lane of the street causing unnecessary traffic backup just to write someone a speeding ticket. 
1 I love how the cops seem like they're genuinely enjoying the interaction.  Probably preferable to have a silly drunk guy over people causing real trouble.
1 Nah this guy getting tazed and doesn't drop his cigarette is the best:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO1zVN4Lag
1 This is infinitely better than the clip OP posted lmaooo 
1 Kevin from The Office.
994 If I was that high I'd have thought it was a quarter trick and freaked out assuming the cop was also a magician.
394 To be fair, the joint hadn't been lit yet. So maybe he hasn't smoked pot tonight...yet. 
23 Obviously the guy didnt smoke any pot YET. He was just on his way to go smoke it
16 Oh goddamnit, here i go down the cops rabbit hole
30 That will always be the best one 
1 "Well done  Deputy Gray; you've won this round."
1 fuck. A grown man looks another in the eye and with a straight face he refers to marijuana as "narcotics". Fuuuuck.
1 That's funny, but did he just call pot a narcodic? That cop needs to get woke real quick.
1 Yeah but he obviously hasn’t smoked it, yet
6 Ah, you win again detective.
1 "narcotics"
1 Do police in the US actually consider marijuana a narcotic?
1 The most insane part of that while video is the cop repeatedly called marijuana a narcotic.
1 Good cops just doing their jobs... but damn, why does marijuana have to be illegal? It's bad to do it while driving but if he wants to smoke some weed he should be allowed to.
1 There should be a sub for awesome Cops clips
1 I've been looking for years for this one and finally just gave it one last Google-fu. Potato quality, but hilarious.  https://youtu.be/peDfrj9ESHU?t=66
1 In high school a friend got pulled over high and the officer basically did the same thing before saying "know how I know you've been smoking marijuana?" and shows her the roach that she had flicked out the window and had gotten stuck in the cops windshield wiper.
1 Here's my favorite: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUp6M1-0gQk
1 I saw this happen in real time when I was a teen.  Guy tried to drive down a street that was barricaded for a carnival. Cops are standing right there. He stopped his car,  got out,  walked yup to the cops and said something like,  "What's going on,  man?"  Cop pulled the joint from behind his ear and said,  "You tell me. "We laughed almost the entire time he was being arrested.  Dude was really cool about it. 
1 My favorite:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQi3-eKmQY8
1  Calling marijuana a “narcotic” is funny to me. I know technically it can be, but it’s so odd. 
1 I love this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvwx_woiItkFucking hilarious.
1 This is [my favorite episode of Cops](https://i.imgur.com/MJcYkOS.gifv). 
1 Lmao. What a tiny joint 
1 Haha, super old cop trick. "do you have anything in the truck I need to worry about?" *suspect glaces at the glovebox* "nooooo?" "uhhuh, step out of the vehicle sir."
1 I mean it could be a normal rollie.
1 Very good.
1 *sips a cup of tea*......go on
1 Is it just me or does that cop sound exactly like Jimmy Kimmel??
1 The way he says "I didn't even know it was there" reminds me of Jim Lehay from Trailer park Boys. HAHA
1 YES. Absolutely favorite Cops moment. Came here hoping for this. The best is the way the cameraman is on guy's left most of the time. Really sells the scene.
1 Holy Mackerel!
1 /r/COPSlol
-14 OP's is just 100X better. That's all.
890 The ending really shocked me.
1 "That's mah child, and she disrespecting" ... "Mah child"..."I don't sell crack I'm a prostitute"
1 "I dont sell crack, I'm a prostitute!"
1 She was buying the other kind of crack.
1 God, I used to think this shit was more funny before I had to deal with tweakers every day. Still kinda funny.
1 This woman says exactly how my mind works all the time. 
1 I love that she said $20 for anything then got mad about getting plaster
127 I did not see that coming.
383 I like that she felt it necessary to even mention that she's a prostitute.
1 Reminds me of this bit from John Mulaney:["Excuse me. I am homeless. I am gay. I have AIDS. I'm new in town."](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/9s5jr6/stand-up-john-mulaney--new-in-town)
40 She smoke something by the look of those burnt lips.
1 I’d say unexpected but it’s Cops. You should expect anything. 😬
1 Even having read this comment before watching the video, that ending was hilarious. I thought it was gonna be spoiled but nope. Still funny
1 Also, she said it like "Don't imply or presume that I'm the kinda degenerate that sells drugs!!! I just suck cock for a living!"
1 Hey, she told a cop the truth. Good for her. 
1 r/Unexpected
1 /r/Unexpected 
1 Holy fuuuvvkk that was actually fucking hilarious
1 That elicited a rapid succession of strange small giggles that I, as a somewhat deep-voiced man,  have never made before. 
1 >I don't sell crack, I'm a prostitute!It's like the perfect alibi.
1 Technically she is selling a form of crack.
1 I too watched the video. That was a good video.
1 Officer: uh huh, your tongue is pasty white.Suspect: I was just eating a kebabI wish I was as quick thinking as that dude. 
704 Dude: "That's all i gotta say, unless you want me to make up stuff"Cop: "Absolutely Not"Dude: "There you go"That part cracked me up! He said it as if that absolved him of everything*Edit resolved -> absolved
1 “I had a Monster drink, I don’t know if that does it”
38 This was the funniest thing I've ever seen. Thank you. 
1 Yes, drugs and prostitution are bad, but you got to at least feel a little sorry for this guy.  He went out thinking he was going to have an awesome night but instead his life went from 0 to fucked in a matter of minutes.
1 "I don't have anythiiiiing...to lie"
64 For some reason he reminds me of the “Linda, listen” kid.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP8RB7UZHKI&app=desktop
1 Is it legal for cop's to go through your phone like that without a warrant? 
1 The framing of his head in the final shot was icing on the cake. Like a little cartoon drug turtle in his shell.
1 “What is that, oh my god...”
1 Wow: 1. driving while high2. possession of meth3. possession of weed4. prostitution5. driving without a license6. under a warrant 
1 [The classic "I'm waiting for a friend" excuse transcends international borders.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17vKgrKQu20)

1 "I don't have anything...to lie" dat hesitation is cause you don't know which crime to deny first
1 I have snow and weed baby maybe we can party a lil
1 Thanks for reminding me of this it is so funny
1 nice username
1 Did his friend ever return?  Crazy what can happen when you're [just waitin on a mate.]( https://youtu.be/71DIT6hYXYo?t=28s)  
1 man I wish someoen would make a POV skit of this guy where you find out everything he is tellign is the truth. 
1 Wait, 100 for an hour? Isn't that a lot for a budget hooker?
316 That camera man probably realized it was the wrong house and just kept rolling
231 Holy shit. This looks like something straight out of The Office and Dwight. 
107 That's hilarious. I love the Sergeant getting there and doing his best not to laugh, but completely failing.
63 If I were a cop, I'd be that guy.  Totally just run into the wrong house, breaking shit, waking everyone up and then trying to explain it all at the end like no one can figure out how I fucked up.  "No, you see... from my perspective, see ... it looked like this home was on fire.""yeah, we get it.""But, it was the other house..."
112 I feel like this could have been on “Reno 911”
17 It might have been how it was edited, but I loved how he just takes off running once he realizes he's at the wrong house.
33 The lady is taking it really well, I don't know how I would've reacted in that situation.
1 >Officer Chad PlowmanYou cant make this stuff up
13 You forgot the closing parenthesis!
1 I like how the supervisor laughed when the cop said he rescued her from her house.
5 OK, you win, that is the best. It's funny because no one is fitting through those windows anyway
1 You have to admit, the lady was pretty chill about it. 
14 Yes that's my favourite. I still wonder if he left the force after that, lol.
4 ) here take this
3 you win.
14 What is he trying to do by breaking every single window pane there? Is it just to get her attention? If that's the case, would banging on the door and ringing the door bell achieve the same goal?
3 lol dead
1 Classic Dwight Schrute
1 Seems like an honest mistake to me... You don't have time to hesitate when a house is burning to the ground.
2 Lol he was braking those windows, like fuck this window.
1 wasnt there an episode where two different police cars hit each other, each car had a camera man in the car
1 Chad Plowman, i feel like he was given the greatest porn name ever.
1 I like that one of the cops was named Chad Plowman. Now there's a name made for porn if I ever heard one
1 "Officer Plowman" really missed his calling. Definitely needed to go into the farming business......or porn
1 Another fort worth one.
1 \>Office Chad Plowmandamn, that's a name
1 this one takes the cake. I cannot imagine the heckling he got from co workers after that night.
1 This thread is a real rabbit hole lol...
1 I’m glad te lady was chill about it
1 I was pissed at this moron cop even before I knew it was the wrong house. If that building was on fire, he would have singlehandedly ensured that it burned to the ground. Modern houses are essentially airtight boxes thanks to advances in insulation technology. Fire needs oxygen to survive, so the good news is that often a fire can be isolated to one room and even starve itself out by consuming all the oxygen in that room. What he did by breaking those windows was ensure that the fire would get a constant and unlimited supply of fresh air while the fire department was still on the way to the scene. The cops also left the front door wide open, allowing lots of air to come in and feed the fire.The worst part though? This kind of thing happens. All. The. Time. Cops show up to fires first and think that they can be heroes by charging in and doing what they think firefighters do. In reality, they have a habit of exacerbating the situation and making it ten times worse for when the FD shows up. We've had to talk to members of our PD on more than one occasion about how they have royally screwed the pooch for us, but they never seem to learn. Aside from guaranteeing that fire would turn into a fully involved structure fire, they also endangered their own lives and the lives of firefighters by running into an IDLH environment without any form of PPE. Guess who has to risk their lives to come and drag your ass out when you pass out from smoke inhalation?
1 I miss the old school shit like this. These days it’s basically all pro-law enforcement propaganda. 
-33 [deleted]
107 What happens before that clip is the best. He does backflips and climbs a pole 
37 You linked the least funny part
30 That's the most jacked little person I've ever seen. 
22 "I can break these cuffs!"
1 Kevin Hart has had a rough life. 
14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2NW1-_HUbw
1 Oh man I can't believe I had to scroll down so far to find this.
1 http://cuffs.ytmnd.com
1 This is what I came to the comments for. 
1 This one has a happy ending, they actually drive him to some little person show (Vegas, am I right?) and he gets offered a job out of it.
1 What is that guy's deal, exactly? 
1 I haven't seen this in years.[ I immediately started singing the remix.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQTXawaAKNA)
1 I really wonder what that guy was on to be able to take a teaser like that and it not phase him one bit. I'm betting it was probably pcp.
1 Arg! You beat me to it. I was going to post this as my favorite clip.
1 Was going to post this. So have my upvote.
1 Why exactly did he taze him?
18 ssy
1 nny
1 Crayons
1 Rents...
1 lol I wanna see this one
1 The funniest part to me is the random "Hah" from the dude filming his TV
36 lady: "let's try this again"officer: "okay. what happened to your face?"lady: "I don't know." cut to her laying on the ground ass blurred. This is brilliant.
1 going for the bite: bad choice
16 Holy shit. Their back and forth was so great. 
1 Did Ya Know?This woman, Trish Bakersby, 49yo,  is about to be elected Sheriff of Hamilton County, Alabama!
1 "I think your nickname is *doo-doo*" is my new go-to burn.
1 It was funny at first but over time I got a bad feeling in my stomach. She’s a mess, but he doesn’t have to be such an asshole. With an ounce of compassion and a sprinkle of deescalation, that could have ended much better. I expect better from the police, honestly.
1 I like how she said "oh boy, here we go" before attempting to bite the second person. 
1 The best part is towards the end she says oh god her we go and goes in for another bite, like there's a full moon and she was trying her best to hold back.
1 Funniest part is near the end when she says "oh god, here we go" and then goes for the second bite attempt. Could not stop laughing.
1 Am I the only one who thinks that the cop was the one in the wrong here. She was clearly drunk and hurt and instead of being treated with compassion and kindness he pushes her to the ground and arrests her? Police officers in America are just so different.
45 That cop was super reckless with that mace haha
8 I was looking to see if anyone had posted this one. 0 to 100 real quick. Definitely my favorite.
1 Man, the NOPD that have to work the French Quarter probably have the hardest job in the world. There is no way I could deal with the debauchery that happens down there on a daily basis.
1 His karate poses were so smooth.
1 The way he came out of the bathroom. Lol!
1 Those guys were as nice as possible (and I wouldn't piss on most cops if they were on fire).Didn't beat him and rinsed his face afterwards. Probably lucky he didn't get shot. He was shaking off mace like it was nothing and much stronger than the first two officers. 
1 That was pretty awesome.  For a second I thought it was going to go a different direction...like if the room key turned out to be stolen or something.  Glad it seemed to work out for him though.
1 > The drugs taped to your testicles aren't yoursTell me this happened somewhere.
1 Definitely saving this thread 
1 It's almost like Reno 911 took inspiration from Cops or something
1 This is fake. Dude's an actor. That's not even a cop. 
1 real talk tho, that dude was hilarious. Hope he didn't do anything serious. 
1 that was funny from start to finish. thank you.
1 Jesus the guy getting arrested is gold. At the end of it. "Ayy real talk tho, in my car I got snacks. Uh would you mind getting my snacks for me..."
1 Lmao gold
1 Holy shit that guy's amazing.
1 omg when the quarters come spilling out. . . is this real?
1 You got the whole scene and context? I'd love to see more. 
1 Didn't this get debunked a while back? Pretty sure these guys are just actors and it's a parody. 
1 That’s a skit, still funny though. 
1 This is fake though and isn't Cops...
11 TPB
11 You might like Live PD.  Kinda has the same cops feel, just with the gimmick of trying to appear "live" 
1 Spike TV is pretty much just a 24/7 marathon of it. 
1 I searched for it on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Google Play - Not on any of them. 
1 Hell.
1 Littering and...?
1 Like [the guy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X2xbLV_NSbk) who seems unaffected by a taser. 
-2 This isn't even close to type of crazy shit they have to put up, yet reddit hates 'em all because of a few bad apples
1 They all chose to be cops...
1 Shit*
1 Meth is the context. Meth is always the context.
1 Fort Worth, Texas
3 then "COPS" has had the best writing staff for damn near thirty years
1 Fort Worth, Texas
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lky5cR7RrVw
1 Exactly what I thought when I saw the first 10 seconds lolAt least its an older clip x_X
1 It’s linked towards the top, figured I’d help a homie out.
1 > Would it be funny if there was a show about leaving an attractive woman in the middle of a neighborhood with known sex offenders? Dude, have you ever heard of To Catch a Predator?? They did it with freaking kids!!
1 No...
1 I'm afraid not. 
9 I thought she was saying "Child".
-3 If she really said "chow" I would equate that with money, or "Don't disrespect the way I make my money" as in "I don't sell crack, I sell my body".I thought at first she said "child" but I don't know how that would make any sense.
2 They’re real. That’s why this show was on the air for so long, you can’t write this craziness. If you want to see a hilarious cops style show where it was written, watch Reno 911. Comedy gold.
2 "I don' sell crack I'm a prostitute"... 
1 Thanks Reagan.
6 It never ceases to amaze me the lengths people will go to on Reddit to suck as much fun from something as possible   
3 That’s not an authoritative voice. That an ‘I can’t believe you called me for this shit’ voice. 
3 His authority comes from the power we as a society give him, there is no god and you spelled sword wrong. GTFO. 
1 Haha that's gonna be my go to in the future before every bud.
1 he actually did have one on his dick... I did not expect that second one.
1 Lol wtf! That cop also dam!
1 This made my day. Goddamn 
1 What's the braaaaand? 
1 the way he got so serious for a second when he said don't cut them really made me laugh 
1 If there is one place that I would never want to be a cop it's vegas.
1 There was, maybe still is, a show called Vegas Lockup or something like that. It's basically cops but just inside the drunk tank from Vegas. It's highly entertaining if you like listening to drunks, meth heads and hookers. 
1 I was just going to say, all the best clips seem to be from Vegas. Just look at the ones in this thread. 
1 “You like to wear what?”“...pannies...”I’m fucking dying.
1 And the noises oh god. like he was birthing them 
1 What really got me about that one is that the cops were actually decent about it and tried to help the guy.
1 I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS
1 This one seems really scripted, no?
1 Your description of the clip didn't do it justice. I was just expecting some muscular guy, not that. 
1 "short muscular guy" or "guy with dwarfism", you decide.
1 Yo that was hilarious and even a little heart warming 
1 Kevin Hart really turned his life around
1 The cops literally got him a job by the end of that; How hard is it to *not* commit crimes?  It's the easiest thing in the world.  Criminal scumbags get wayyyyy too many chances and continue to disrupt society and inflict suffering on others.  Ridiculous.At least watching that criminal dwarf was funny.
1 gotta make sure you’re still drunk for court the next morning
1 Toss that beer!*chugs the second one*
1 Exactly what I was thinking. Why spend money producing Reno 911 when you can just walk around filming this guy for a couple nights?
1 As soon as the cop in this video was like “aw that’s who it is” it immediately made me think of Terry Bernadino - definitely a Reno 911 moment
1 Haha! I was like ‘wtf are you putting your hand in there, he’s trolling you!!!’ 
259 Then the cop stole his nose
106 [You mean like this?](https://youtu.be/52br8-y0ONU)
1 Holy shit man thanks for the J!-Son you're gonna have to come with me.-Alright I guess since you found it I'll share.
1 Gawd damn. Not only do I have to worry about undercover cops, I have to worry about undercover magicians pretending to be cops?
1 http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/key-and-peele/videos/magician-cop
1 You had that in your hand already. Get out of here with your black magic.
1 Hey man you planted that! Get it? Are we on a magic/comedy road show?
1 Quarter trick? Two dimes & one nickel bag?
1 There’s something satisfying about being the 666 updoot ^_^
1 [This guy's fascinated with everything] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdVh2OxMTpY) 
129 True.  Maybe he put that joint behind his ear weeks ago.
13 Could also just be tobacco.
1 The pupils in the thumbnail suggests otherwise.
1 Dude the guy was stoned and drunk as fuck
1 I’ve been here for seven weeks now 
1 very good
1 For benefit of the cameras.  Most people who watch COPS aren't chillboyes.
1 nar·cot·icnärˈkädik/nounnoun: narcotic; plural noun: narcotics    1.    a drug or other substance affecting mood or behavior and sold for nonmedical purposes, especially an illegal one.
1 What exactly is wrong with this?
1 That's because it is.
1 Seriously, I watch videos like this and think of how sad it is that we treated people with addiction issues (or people just trying to enjoy a good high) as deviant criminals. I feel like people are going to watch COPS in like 50 years and think we were fucking insane.
1 marijuana is sometimes ingested through the temple, you can place a joint behind your ear and get a mellow high over the course of a few hours.
1 I don't know.  Probably.
1 Yeah, and that guy probably doesn't mention that because he wants to be famous for being a moron instead.
4 I'm so sorry that you didn't enjoy it.  I hate that for you.
502 How did the cop restrain himself?  I would find it difficult to not audibly laugh at the last statement from pure surprise at how candid the exchange was.
1 LOL how dare she not get the facts right. The audacity.
1 Don't you clickbait me!
1 You know what? She seems to take pride in her work. Good for her. 
1 r/unexpected
1 /r/unexpected
1 Same. then I bursted out laughing. 
1 *What a tweest!*
1 it was pretty sweet.
1 It didn't me.
1 Well, then in fact she does sell her crack.
1 She's just putting it out there. 
1 What a twist!
1 Law enforcement is their biggest customer here, so she's probably just advertising.
256 Free ad space, bro.
1 It was like she was pulling rank. She may as well have said she was a banker. And fair enough, being a prostitute probably is higher on the moral chain that crack salesman.
1 It was a hint of an invitation to the officer, with her smiling at the end and everything
1 She has a lot in common with Jeff Sessions. No one asked if she was a prostitute.  She chose to incriminate herself just because--hey--why not?
1 Don't be disrespecting. 
1 "Gonna push em " 
62 Dick. She smoked dick. She's a prostitute, are you even listening ?
1 Going out on a limb here and saying that it was crack. Just a crazy hunch I have.
1 That just *might* be the reason she’s a prostitute... 
1 How do we know which one is lying? 
1 He liked the funny part though. That’s what makes him so unique.
1 I just wish I was eating a kebab
1 Maybe give meth a shot?
1 This dude's problem is that time is slowed down by the meth, so he has a lot of time to think of an answer. But the meth also makes him stupid so he can't make up good excuses.
1 Isnt the pasty tongue just from smoking period not just meth? 
1 I would probably just say "cum"
1 It's not his first rodeo.
1 "Unless you want me to start making stuff up.""Aaaabsolutely not."
79 *absolved
1 Sooo... Can i go?
1 Very good. 
4 > resolvedAbsolved?
1 *dissolved 
1 Excellent 
1 Dude: "I didn't get this cart from Food Lion"Cop: "What's that say right there?"Dude: "Food Lion"Can't find the clip but I distinctly remember that quote from childhood and how my cousins thought it was so funny
1 Whoever the editor for that show is deserves an award. Managed to edit it in a way to deliver such perfect timing and delivery. 
1 I have snow and weed baby ready 2 party
1 I agree, though I think his life might have been messed up before by the sounds of it.Multiple warrants, restricted drivers licence.
1 Don't understand why drugs and prostitution are kept illegal. All it does is push them underground.
1 I think he as a little above 0 to start
1 I mean, he was also driving while high. Not cool 
1 No kidding. The older I get, the harder it is to watch Cops because they're almost always arresting people for drugs. They're sick, not criminals. It's like laughing at cancer patients.
1 [Must be this same kid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VPyp44gf8s)
1 "Linda lick it, lick it."
1 I was gonna say that it seems like you’d need a warrant for that but maybe the guy gave them permission
1 It was highly edited. Could be they asked and he consented and we just didn't see
1 Pretty sure finding drugs is probable cause for a search. 
1 That's still up for debates in the courts IIRC, it's never been fully resolved. Might also vary per state.
1 If you give consent
1 I haven't watched that yet cause I'm waiting for my mate but I think I have a good idea which vid that is.
194 I was expecting the cop to start breaking random small windows from the inside.  
1 Well I was just thinking, this house doesn't look on fire and it's a pretty big fire so I'm sure no matter where it was it would fill the house with smoke. 
1 Too good tv. 
1 *Dwight continues to dramatically and pointlessly smash windows while Michael forcefully escorts the resident outside*
1 Reno 911.
1 i picture dwight taking a sledgehammer to jim's home cabinets
1 Omg this is so true
1  [https://vgy.me/wfnOrH.jpg](https://vgy.me/wfnOrH.jpg)
1 Oh that is soooooo good. hahahaha. That story is still probably making it's rounds around the department. 
1 "How are we gonna write this one up?""You're the supervisor, you tell me"Lmao
1 So, years back, after a concert, we had to go out and clear the parking lot.  People were not allowed to camp in the lot, but it was a PHISH concert and apparently that is a thing with that type of crowd.  So we are walking along the cars, knocking on windows and telling people to move along.  I knock on a window where I can see someone sleeping. Guy wakes up, but then I realize the actual driver is outside packing up their stuff and getting ready to leave.  So I woke up the person without needing to.  I also knocked REALLY freaking loudly on the window with my flash light, amazed I did not break it honestly.So much crazy that night.. a girl tied her dog to her bumper, then got high and her dog ran off.  At least she did not drag her dog behind her car.  At least the crowd was not violent at all. 
46 The way he was breaking those small windows, that's exactly what I thought it was.
1 They could have parodied this clip & not changed a single thing."What are we gonna do?""You're the supervisor, you tell me"
1 I wouldn't be mad at all. I feel so bad for that guy. It's nighttime, he's probably got adrenaline pumping, he's in a rush and he made an honest mistake. 
1 I think I would have been relieved that my house wasn't actually on fire. 
1 LMAO saw that too.  What a name.
9 )
1 I rescued her from her house, but her house was not on fire at the time. Lmao.
1 She probably assumed the cops will pay for the damage
11 He was going to attempt breaking the window frames to get in 
1 He answered that in the video at the end. He was going to try break the middle thing to get into the house if she didnt open the door.
11 maybe to get smoke from the inside of the house out? the way he was busting them seemed really random and funny tho lol
1 I think the first one was a mistake, I think he was just trying to knock on it and then it broke. Then he tried to play it off as if that was what he meant to do by breaking more windows.
2 *breaking
1 Brakes are in your car
13 oh no, a police officer thought someone was in danger and tried his best to help them. What a terrible fucking world we live in!
22 Those 2 things aren’t related. He thought the house was on fire from where the smoke was pouring past this woman’s house. He legitimately thought someone was in danger and he was trying to help them. That doesn’t mean he’s going to pull a gun and shoot someone next time. Not all cops are trigger happy killers, no reason to be so pessimistic about it. 
28 Dude, the guy was concerned for someone's safety and was doing his best to help, but he made a mistake. It's pretty scummy to turn it into something negative.
24 Omg shut the fuck up. 
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Co2iH44ug
1 First I thought, man those shorts make him look small. Then I thought, boy that officer is a huge. Finally I realized he was tiny when he walked to the hood of the car.
1 You CAN'T break those cuffs..
1 Way to copy the top comment from YouTube.
1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=982ni1nxu3U
1 One of the hooks most likely missed or got caught on his clothing. Or both hooks weren't far enough apart.  
1 I think only one barb of the thing stuck in and the other one got deflected/caught in his shirt. Both barbs need to stick in to shock the person.
1 Actually, it might not be anything at all; the taser may not have deployed correctly and thus the guy isn't affected. If the prongs land too close together, the electrical current will just jump from one to the other so all you get is a (relatively) mild burning sensation.This is part of the reason why LEOs often hate tasers; there is a pretty reasonable chance that they do precisely nothing.
4 Uhh... sure?
1 Biting a cop is a good way to get bodied, and she did it twice. 
1 What?
1 Can’t be right?! Link? 
1 The fact that this is even somewhat conceivable in people's eyes tells us all we need to know about Alabama, America and The World (seemingly) in 2017. Lmfao
1 Source? No such County exists 
1 I'm gonna need to see a source on that one.
1 [I don't believe you](https://i.imgur.com/0r813gP.jpg).
1 you got any links for that buddy?
1 Okay and what would you have done once she started walking away, just let her go? Lmfao.
1 She tried to bite him twice.
1 He asked her to stay seated so she doesn't injure herself further. A lawful order from an officer must be obeyed so he attempts to make her sit when she tried to stand. She proceeds to bite him which is assaulting an officer so he then has the right to arrest her. Perhaps it wasn't right to try to make a drunk person sit down, but once she bit him she doesn't get much of a say in what happens after.
1 He seemed like he was trying to be compassionate and figure out what happened.  He called for an ambulance and asked for her to stay seated since she was obviously (and admittedly) intoxicated.  he wasn't shoving her to the ground.  When he tried to get her to sit down, she bit him which changes the game entirely.
25 yea he defiantly got his buddy in the face.
1 How about vegas? they have guns. 
1 On Cops! I just didn't have time to search the clip. I may have botched the quote but that's definitely the gist. 
1 He's not a cop. He's a bounty hunter. Regardless, I still think it's fake because it's way too good to be true. 
1 It's been proven fake
1 [Nope. This one is fake. They're all actors. ](https://youtu.be/9IgS8cnP-YQ)
1 No.
1 That's the best part. "We're here with live PD and let's go to this incident from 6 hours ago." 
1 I mean, it's only delayed by like 10-30 minutes when it isn't "from earlier".  Not really a gimmick.
1 I think it was speeding. I saw it like 15 yrs ago at least..
1 The officer needed more distance betweem him and the subject. The prongs did not have a good spread which means the electicity goes through less muscle making it easier to deal with. If he would of put the front of the taser  (as in a stun drive) on the guy on say his calf he might of dropped like a sack of potatoes. But he could of been running on something affecting it as well.
1 what the fuck lol he barely even flinches
24 Camera recording all interactions are improving things, but people are reasonably upset when cops don't call out and defend cops that plant evidence, use excessive force, break the law or falsify things. When the good apples defend or remain silent about the bad apples it makes the whole barrel look bad.

1 I know I saw it just after I posted, but I don't delete, I stick with my screw ups.
1 Heard of it but never seen it. That's crazy. Makes you wonder where we draw the line. Like should it be okay to make alcohol readily available at an AA meeting just to screw with people? Then take it a step further by filming and making it into entertainment? It's weird.
8 Because the young man standing next to her is her son?
-1 Smoking crack, fucking blacks, and eating chicken. God Bless the USA
-4 Thankyou for spelling help I speak truth 
1 Ohh man, I'm in the same camp.  Gonna pick up some Bud Red just to get this party started.
1 I found it hilarious the cop kinda got offended by him saying don't cut them. The cop try's to make a joke about them already having a hole in them because you know that's comparable to cutting a leg off.
1 That's the part that made me sad. Dude probably can't afford much clothing because of his addiction so even drunk he got afraid they'd cut his pants.
1 It's like he sobered up in that moment."Stick your hands down my pants but don't fuck with the jeans brah"
1 Honestly, I'd prefer dealing with that guy and people like him vs the depressing realities and dangers of something like Englewood or even a worse area in Chicago. I have cop buddies and with the stories they tell it word be hard for me not to turn to alcohol or something to deal with the stress.
1 Ehhhh, wouldn't be boring that's for sure. I honestly think I'd rather do that than do state highway patrol in the middle of nowhere Kansas.
1 You'd never be bored at work
1 Ehh this kind of shit is pretty harmless. I'd much rather deal with random drunk mofos than any type of violent crime.
1 nor a cab driver. Those ppl are as hard as diamonds.
1 tbh it would probably be preety fun they seem to enjoy it
1 New Orleans. Mardi Gras.
1 I actually worked in CCDC (Vegas county jail, where that show is recorded.) a few times. The show was called "Jailed" and it wasn't just the drunk tank, it was intake/booking. But it being Vegas, a majority of them were drunk. The rest were hookers. Fun Fact: They put all the hookers in the same holding cell.
1 It’s on UK Netflix and it’s great 
1 Baby bud
1 "It's a baby bud" seemed to go unnoticed, even the cop who said looked around like "that was a good one ay fellas?", and nobody laughed lol
1 There was a Vegas cop show that had the cop from this clip in it, it was quite good.
1 Very good
1 That's not *my* nose sir. 
1 i never watched the show, dont have cable or a TV, but now i am sad i feel like i missed out on something special.
1 Undercover magicians undercover as cops
1 Or you know, more logically, like he put it there not long ago and was going to smoke it after successfully drunk driving home.
1 That's the one he keeps handy for emergencies. In case things get *weird*.
12 Yea... Those Rizla king skins are for truckers who can't afford to stop and roll a smoke that often... 
1 Tell it to the judge.
1 hey speak for yourself.
1 This is the legal definition, which basically means "anything we don't like". The medical definition is way more specific, robust and useful.
1 Funny. It is sold for medical purposes and it is legal in a few states. Fuck, the federal government even PROVIDES pot to a few people for medical reasons.https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/free-pot-federal-program-ships-marijuana-to-four/
1 got to get off this narcotic caffeine then
1 A narcotic is a drug that is opiate based and a CNS depressant as the result, that's where the narco part comes from. Anything else, is just slang.
1 And that isn’t pot.
1 I'd imagine if you worked in that sort of neighbourhood everyday it'd be hard to find it funny.
1 I’ve been around a lot of drug addicts and alcoholics. The sadness of what their life must be like greatly outweighs the humor and ability to laugh hysterically at what they say. 
1 Because this shit happens to them daily
1 Eh, prostitution is illegal, but it's less serious than drugs. Plead for the lesser charge.Also, depending on her prior encounters with cops in the area they probably don't give a crap about a small time prostitute trying to make ends meet. They just got called out there because a drug addict freaked out. They likely would much rather go after a drug dealer etc.
1 We don't know if he did or not because the video cuts off at that exact moment. 
1 >  I would find it difficult to not audibly laugh at the last statementI certainly didn't. I'm just glad I live alone so no one could hear that horrible candid laugh noise I make sometimes. 
1 If you want to be a cop, you probably don't have a good sense of humor.
1 Yes! I almost ran over a prostitute once. She crossed the highway in front of me and I had to brake so hard I lost control and slid into a ditch. Thankfully I was ok and car was undamaged. She came over to the car and asked if I was ok, I said yes, "are you ok?" She said yes and then thought about it for a second before asking, "Did you ask if I was ok or Did I need a ride?"
1 In a way, aren't they both selling crack? 
1 Higher than banker as well. 
1 Well it is a time-honored trade.
1 Crack salesman. I like that. 
1 I mean... I'd agree with that. Selling a temporary sexual release vs a drug that's annihilated the lives of so, so many? I'd be friends with someone who was a prostitute, I don't think I could be friends with a crack dealer. 
19 Dick burn is a serious problem in the working woman’s community. 
1 Hahahhahahahahhahaa
1 Hm true. I meant she told the truth about being a prostitute. But I don't really believe the coked out lady got plaster for 20 dollars and then wanted her money back after getting apparently nothing. 
1 Let's get in a cabI'll buy you a kebab
1 I was just eating kebab flavoured Doritos. What a time to be alive.
1 It doesn't matter what excuses you come up with when the cops find a bag of meth on your lap.
1 So if I study on meth time is slowed down so next time I cram I'll have more time to study? 
1 > This dude's problem is that time is slowed down by the meth, so he has a lot of time to think of an answer.Yeah, no. That may be what they do in some video games, but it doesn't do that IRL at all.If anything your mind is racing when on that shit. You don't interpret time as slower.
1 rapidly idiotic. That's a good description for what meth makes you. 
1 I think he did pretty damn good. Except telling them to pull the wallet out. The kebab must have went to his head.
1 I mean my tongue sometimes looks like that at the end of the day just from normal plaque or whatever.
23 Thank you
1 Good of you to resolve this absolve/resolve issue. 
1 Very good
1 no, stay. I have cold beer in the trunk and a pre-rolled J
1 There you go
1 *solved
1 No baby 100 for an hour.
1 Long story short.  Dong on titties.
1 Show bob and vagene
1 To be fair, he said "from zero to fucked," not "from awesome to fucked."
1 shhh we can't have you spreading these rational ideas nilly willy. also think of all the policemen that would have to do actual police work.
1 There's some logic in this when you consider Amsterdam.
1 Yes lets make meth legal my dude!!!! 
1 its so the lower classes can always be suppressed harrassed and jailed at any given time, thats why. The rich do just as much drugs and whores, but rarely if ever get arrested for it because they do it in gated communities behind gold encrusted gates with private security. And if they do ever get arrested the hire a great lawyer and they go to rehab, their lives are never ruined unlike a poor person who gets arrested for the exact same thing. its class warfare in this country, full on, the sooner ppl realize this the better. 
1 2edgy4me
1 LOL what is he even saying?! Omfg he is too cute. That haggling posture. 
1 are they gonna find drugs in your cell phone?
1 A search of the car, searching the phone seems completely unnecessary 
114 I would like to take this opportunity to say DON'T start randomly breaking windows if you see a house on fire (and want to alert the occupants). You will add oxygen to the fire and it will get bigger.Open the door if you have to, and then close the door when you are done. 
1 https://youtu.be/OBuAfIjsFVk?t=1m5s
1 WE HAVE TO SAVE THE ANTIQUES! Drops priceless memorandum of great-grandfather that died in WWII storming the beaches of Normandy. 
1 It's made even better by the fact that the whole thing is caught on tape so they can just replay that tape whenever they want to laugh at it. lol
1 Oh definitely, I'm just saying that if I'm woken up in the middle of the night by someone bashing my windows in I think I might not be that reasonable.
1 That's true, but I tend to be super angry and aggressive when I'm woken up like that.
6 Perfect
6 Yeah I guess that could be what he was probably thinking, even though if there actually was a fire that wouldn't have too much of an effect. When he smashed the first pane I thought he was doing it so people inside could hear him, then he just kept smashing the shit out of the entire thing and I was like "Dude, they can probably hear you already." Hahaha
-32 No, Cops should be able to handle their shit better. or else don't be a cop. Simple, really. 
1 That was so much more wholesome than I expected
1 This is the full clip I was looking for. GOAT!
1 Super funny but also a little sad.
1 It kinda looks like stand up comic [Brad Williams](https://www.bradwilliamscomedy.com/bio) at the end of that.
1 UAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
1 AAHHHHH.
1 Oh jesus. I didn't even look there, I was just surprised no one had said it yet. 
3 Yes
1 I don't know.
1 Really? You don't think the drunk woman in that video could be a sheriff? Hmm....
11 munster got rekted
1 He did seem pretty defiant about it.
1 I think you'll find those who proved it fake were themselves proved to be fake fake-provers.

15 Almost as if the few bad apples... spoil the bunch. That part of the phrase always gets left out. 
4 You speak what you *believe* is truth. That doesn't make it *true* friend.
1 Ah, *that* bud. 
1 Imagine living here ;) Although I am on the fringe of West Englewood + Englewood. 
1 My FIL was a detective in Chicago back in the day.  I can't believe some of the stories that he told.I say there are jobs, there are careers and then there are callings.  Some of examples of callings are: nurse, teacher, pedicurist, male gigolo and a cop.  Oyeeee! 
1 Example?
1 I'm confused. Isn't Englewood on the SW side of Chicago? Or am I confusing the Chicago Englewood with somewhere else?
1 las vegas has extremely dangerous low income areas, there are neighborhoods that are like little mini thunderdomes surrounded by chain link fence
1 Are you talking about Inglewood, near LA?
1 That's what my buddy does and most of the time it's super relaxed and straightforward. Then sometimes he is in high speed chases with mobile method labs. Most of the time though he is helping broken down motorists. Great guy.
1 Spot the optimist.
1 sometimes you get porque no los dos
1 Didn't know that was there. 
1 You can still watch it
1 Almost all of their clips are on youtube. I missed the show when it's on the air too, which will be one of my main regrets as I'm lying on my death bed, but I love to binge watch them every few months or so. 
1 The "show" is shit watch the youtube videos instead
1 Nothing gets by you.
1 Nope.  I can tell by the paper that it's been there for several weeks.
1 Very good
1 Very good. 
1 Celebratory reef sesh got botched yet again.
1 So many truckers at every corner store in the middle of the city.
1 I mean, it's pretty easy to find out.It's perfectly legal to roll your own cigarettes. 
1 I'm pretty sure the guy making the arrest was an officer of the law, not a doctor.
1 But, it's sold for non medical purpose too...
1 Cocaine has uses as a topical anesthetic and is frequently used in sinus surgery. That doesn't mean you're allowed to buy it on a street corner and snort it in your car on the way home. 
1 "Especially" and "Only" are two different words with two different meanings.Drugs that have primarily medical usage can also be called narcotics, many painkillers are often referred to that way.Also, pot is mostly a recreational drug, and even if it was mostly a medical drug, calling it a narcotic in the context of a DUI makes sense.
1  Marijuana is mentioned in the Merriam Webster definition of narcotic. 
1 Lol, it affects mood and behavior and is still sold for non medical use. Why is everyone so triggered over a definition? 
1 Nah they probably find it funny, but gotta refrain the laughter to maintain some professionalism.
1 Id imagine the opposite. You become desensitized 
1 Yeah I think it’s like how people laugh at kids falling down the stairs and shit online, for some reason. But if you were actually there your first thought wouldn’t be laughter (if you’re a normal functioning human) it wold probably be concern. 
1 Was she hot?
1 In my experience bankers tend to go for the more pure stuff.
1 Yes, but one is organic and earth friendly.
1 > In a way, aren't they both selling crack?http://i.imgur.com/8y5ABu4.gifv
1 Yes but a prostitute can wash hers and sell it again. 
1 She wanted rock, you don’t accept plaster when you want rock. A good contractor knows the materials they need. 
1 Are the most beautiful girl in the...room
1 No baby, $100 for an hour.
1 WTF? Is that a new Taco Bell item or something?
1 Hmm what? That bag of meth? Oh yeah, someone put that on my lap when I was having a nap
1 I smoke ciggarets and its always like that im not sure how thats admissible evidence in any situation.
1 There you go. 
1 Is this going to be a thing now? 
1 What's wrong with Amsterdam?
1 Honestly I think it should be legal to possess. Right now you have people who make a bad choice and get fucked over for life because of it. If possession was legal (or decriminalized, but selling illegal) it'd be easier for people to get help and not end up in the streets.
1 Just because it could be legal doesn't mean it would be harmless!!!
1 Good idea. Let's make all the drugs legal and instead of spending money on the endless fight against it, use it to provide education and rehabilitation!God damn you are so smart,
1 It's close relative can be yours with just a 5 minute doctor appointment.
118 and shit talk the fire so it knows who's boss
1 It’s always good etiquette to close the door behind you, even in a house fire. Got it.  
1 Yeah that's all I could think was he was adding a nice draft 
-2 This doesn't sound right. If we assume door closed means we are helping to suffocate the fire, that means the fire is already displacing all the oxygen inside and closing the door will only help to kill people who are trying to breathe through smoke to escape. If the oxygen has not been displaced yet, then opening the door should not contribute appreciably more, and also allows for one less barrier to exiting the house safely. Im not qualified in this field, but if you aren't as well please stop disseminating potentially fatal information on the internet.
1 (
5 Actually, if there was a real fire. He could have only made it worse. From the looks of things, there was no oxygen supply at the front of the house. Had there been a fire, opening all those windows could have drawn the fire to the front of the house. 
3 "Ah fire! Break shit!"
18 People make mistakes. I guarantee every cop has made at least one mistake at least once. Obviously the guy fucked up but equating that to his likelihood of making a mistake in a gun situation is stupid.
1 Yeah that was genuinely nice - brilliant cops.
1 Ive seen this a bunch of times and never knew there was such a good ending to it.
1 They even got the man a job out of the ordeal. I call that A+ cop work. Lead by example, officers.
1 I mean it was a happy ending.
1 Lets try this again.
1 Well, I absolutely believe that insane drunks can get elected Sheriff.  It's the google search that tipped me off. 
1 Oh... I was super excited that you found it. But take the upvote anyway!
1 I'm admittedly terrible at colloquials lol
1 Yeah my buddy works your area as his beat. Man does he have some stories... Granted it's slowly been getting better over the years. Stay safe out there.
1 Yes that's the Englewood I was talking about.
1 Where is this at? As a local, I'd like to know
1 I doubt it's anywhere as bad as Chicago. Considering out weekly shootings consistently make national news. 
1 No, Englewood Chicago.
1 Power of oberservation
1 ddnevnknowthwsthere
1 Very good
1 You can tell because of how it is.
1 Man, you must be reading a different paper because my newspaper is pretty lacking in that kind of detail
1 You can still be charged with possession, paraphanillia, distrurbing the peace, resisting arrest, and knowingly wasting an officer's time (obstruction). It happens every day. 
1 Not as easy as you'd think. In most jurisdictions a police officer can look *at* a bag of drugs, or a joint, but you need a warrant to look insider of either.  Even if he got the warrant they'd have to call in forensics to perform the actual dissection. That's why people keep their drugs in bags/use joints, it's a legal loophole.
1 And what's your point? 
1 That’s the problem.
1 Let's be honest, mostly non medical purposes. 
1 You should be able to freely buy it, just like all drugs. But also, cocaine and pot are not even in the same ballpark of substances.
1 But it also isn’t...You’re the one triggered and unable to understand definitions.
1 Oh it gets told to everybody at the end of the shift.
1 Nah, they probably don't find it that funny.
1 Exactly- story for later that no one believes because it's so funny.
1 Exactly- story for later that no one believes because it's so funny.
1 Can confirm.  I have two relatives in law enforcement and they can go from seeing someone with an axe stuck in their forehead to a Little League game in 30 minutes and enjoy the rest of their day.
1 I dunno. I reckon you'd find this funny at first, until you found one of these people you talked to dead. It'd probably be less funny after that.
1 Biodegrabberbyit
1 "In that case, no problem sir!  If you can point out the person who gave you the baggie of meth you get a free pass."
1 Thank you one and all.
1 I might be talking from my ass, but isn't Amsterdam super lax on those laws and so far things seem to go ok?  Nothing crazy or horrible comes from the open use/practice
1 Nothing as far as I can tell!  But there should always be laws against hard addictive drugs, they can take down whole societies otherwise.
1 You tell them to get down off the couch! Turn your back on it if it doesn't listen! The firewhisperer knows all!
1 Go full alpha on it. Make it the beta fire. You may have to hump it to establish dominance. 
1 piss on it to establish dominance 
1 Then pee on it to let it know that actions have consequences.
1 Curb Your Enthusiasm reference?
1 Firefighter cadet here. Wetonred24 is correct, improperly ventilating the fire (knocking out windows) could potentially exacerbate the problem by making the fire grow at an even faster rate. Opening and closing the door (to try to alert the residents) does not allow enough oxygen to flow through to help the fire grow. If you leave the door open (or knock out the wrong window), the new air flow generated will replace the burned gases and smoke with oxygen; in essence, adding more fuel to the fire, which could make it harder to stop it from spreading. There's enough oxygen in the house near the floor for someone to survive and be rescued. If you're in a situation where you can safely get out of the house without going into the fire, then that's the obvious choice to make. However, if you're stuck and unable to get out, the effects of elevated carbon monoxide levels alone make it difficult to escape, which is why fire departments are obviously trained to search and rescue in working fires.
1 You could at least look it up before commenting that they are wrong. It's pretty basic fire education: fuel, ignition, oxygen. Often times you can get a huge fireball once the fire compromises the windows and let's a huge gust of air in. 
1 Closing doors behind you is definitely official advice for buildings that are on fire, it's why fire doors and such automatically close, and why external fire doors are often illegal to keep held open.When a fire is going, the reduced oxygen can keep it low/smouldering. Not enough to stop it from burning the building down eventually, but can significantly slow it down.It's also likely that the fire might be contained inside one room by doors, which would let you get individuals in other rooms out.By opening external windows and doors, you allow a free flow of oxygen from outside into the building and potentially to the fire itself, which will let it burn more freely (generating more smoke), and will also cause it to be more likely to spread towards the source of the oxygen. This can potentially cut off your exit if you are entering the house.  In certain situations, this surge of oxygen can also cause a backdraft where smouldering fire is very hot but has no oxygen, then surges as the wave of fresh oxygen hits it, effectively causing an explosion.  The extra oxygen will generally help the fire a lot more than will help an occupant.
1 I am qualified, and opening the door/Windows introduces oxygen to the fire.It can and will strengthen the fire. It's not about suffocating the fire, it's about keeping it contained as best as possible. When we enter a fire through the door we try to keep the door closed, and don't break any windows or cut any holes until we get water on the fire.Of course, if there is an immediate rescuer to be made, break the damn window and get in and out. But dont do it unnecessarily. You are creating a "flow path." The fire will want to "feed" off the fresh oxygen. Why do you think hotels or big office buildings have fire doors?Don't  try and sound smart and educated if YOU aren't qualified.Here's an hour long YouTube video.https://youtu.be/A7QpojetrYo
1 Depends on the fire. Doing it near where the fire already is helps by giving the smoke an outlet. But doing it on a part of the house that is still ok will spread the fire towards that area.

1 It’s been getting better?!! Wth. Says who?
1 Amazing how that happens
1 The power of observation
1 Yes, exactly.
1 Not sure if you're serious or taking a shot at cops making up charges, but as a former attorney I can tell you that not a single one of those things occurred here.
1 This may be the dumbest drug myth ever.Totally false.
1 You could smell it man.
1 I get that the definition is overbroad, but giving a cop shit for the correct use of a legal term seems pretty silly to me.
1 The argument could be made that almost everyone who uses pot is self medicating. But either way, pot shouldn’t be illegal anymore than alcohol or caffeine.
1 ay Joey come here lemmee tell you about these 2 broads I got on this call today

1 CLASH OF THE TITANS
1 The specific situation is almost impossible to not find funny. The people and their condition is not funny, but I suspect anyone who deals with these people on a daily basis have enough compartmentalization to laugh at this. You aren't laughing at the people, you are laughing at the situation.
1 Nah, it’s still funny
1 As I said officer, I was having a nap and someone must have put it on my lap while I was just resting my eyes.Can I go back to eating my kebab now?
1 Sorry which whole societies were taken down by legalized hard addictive drugs?
1 Okay thanks for chiming in, I stand corrected.
1 I didn't say it was wrong, I said it doesn't sound right, and that he could potentially be spreading this bad information. I even included that I don't know what I'm talking about either, someone who does did comment, and now it's settled. Why are you even here?
1 Thank you! 
1 [Statistics](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/community/englewood) from crime in the area show it's improving. See the graphs at the bottom? Crime has steadily going down.

1 I drive completely encased in a ziplock bag to avoid any police searches.  We're just going to have to agree to disagree.
1 But... It's in the Constitution!
1 The smell would technically be coming from within the joint which is legally protected.
1 It’s not though.
1 Strangely enough I think I've felt worse from drinking a lot of coffee than either smoking or drinking in my life. Caffeine just makes me feel anxious.
1 Sure but you gotta do it the right way so people respect it. If you say 'it should be legal you're a dick for arresting me' to a cop is like saying 'this should be free why can I steal it' to a cashier. They don't make the rules they carry them out.
1 It's getting new subs now!! 
1 Alright everybody, that's a wrap-- we've got a professional! I guess the cop found it funny. Lets send him a cake.

Or a mac pro at home. The problem is those computers are still too expensive for gamers. So while the capabilities are now there, Apple would really have to step up with a budget desktop if they wanted to interest gamers. And well, they've never made a budget anything really.

2 You know I dont even know why pc is on its own ...isnt pc short for personal computer? Isnt a mac a personal computer too? I guess Microsoft vs Apple doesnt roll off the tongue as well as pc vs mac.
2 I have a Macbook Pro from my work. I don't have any other computer so I use it to play DotA 2. It works just fine.

1 Look. It's all I could find. 
1 Spidey senses tingling. 
1 That took me longer than it should have...
1 In all fairness, that could very well be an XBox 360 devkit.  The initial devkits were PowerMac G5 towers that looked just like that.  They ran a special PPC build of Windows.Yes, there were early service packs of NT4 that ran on PPC and Alpha.  I think it went up to SP4.  The Alpha stuff was pretty decent, but the dynamic binary translation stuff wasn't up to snuff, i.e. I couldn't play StarCraft.I also had the requisite IBM PowerSeries desktop for Windows as well.  It was the equivalent of a 41T, but I only ever ran AIX on it...slowly.  RAM was super tight because it was proprietary, while my Alpha was well fed with its normal DIMMs.

1 Took me way too long to realize how expensive her gaming chair really is.
1 That took may way longer than it should have...
1 Oh wow.  It took me like 5 mins to realize she was *sitting on a Mac*...I thought it was just a post making fun of the ignorance of putting that label on that graphic because she's obviously using a PC..
1 It took me longer than I care to admit.
1 Either way...it's really uncomfortable.
1 Steam is doing a lot for both mac and Linux gaming, but windows is still the best computer gaming platform
1 Yo but real talk that Mac Pro case is still one of the best looking cases out there and I’d LOVE to get my hands on one to add to a build. 
1 Although most Macs are shit for gaming I was wondering if anyone has looked at the new iMac pro coming out this month, it looks really good. Anyone able to confirm this or tell me why it's shit?
1 OG triple OG triple triple
1 Whitty!
1 That's a huge waste of a keyboard. I love those flat keyboards.
1 It's for recording music and making videos really not gaming dummies
1 It took me a good 10 seconds to realize
1 I feel like if people actually knew how to game on Macs, there would be far less of these BS memes on the Internet. People would be too preoccupied with gaming on Macs.
1 Looks good!

1 This is totally epic!
1 Ironic 😋
1 I game on my Mac a lot, but only for stuff like civilization and smaller steam games. I don't play huge AAA games on it. That's what I have an Xbox for.
1 It may be a Hackintosh. 
1 We know this image isn't real because no one plays DayZ any more.

1 Ha! I'm very much a "mac" person and hate windows, but even I'll admit Mac is garbage for gaming. If I wanted to build a gaming computer (which I don't), I'd definitely go windows. 
1 Don't knock it. They were pretty comfy. 
1 Macintush.
1 I have a macbook pro, and occasionally when I don't feel like sitting in my office to game, I just stream it to my macbook so I can lazily game wherever I want.
1 Substance>Style 
1 Say what you will about Macs, but that PowerMac G5 is hands down my favourite desktop PC design ever.
1 I had that version of the mac pro for final cut editing for years.  I actually had a fantastic gaming experience on it through bootcamp.  It was super expandable, easy to work on and ran cool.
1 She is sitting an uncomfortably far distance away from the keyboard
1 I have one of those. It's actually surprisingly comfortable.

1 Running in sand
1 I am a lifelong video gamer (from the coin-op age) and have only ever used Macs and I find this absolutely hilarious.That said, there are plenty of brilliant indie casual games for the Mac.  I haven't owned a console since my Vectrex.  I frankly would have bought a PC or console for gaming if my life had gone better—no money and guilt about gaming (not that I don't waste my time just as much anyway).
1 I sold my rig and now I run Windows 10 on my Imac and game.  Love it..  I paid $3800 for it but who cares. 
1 I want to mac on that gamer.
1 Took me a while to notice it 
1 christ her posture's good

1 What about gaming on a Mac book?
1 Anyone who has a Mac (or a old pc) and wants to game with high end graphics check out Nvidia Ge Force Now. The Nvidia graphics card company lets you connect to their servers and play your games on ultra high settings. It’s free for now but it will cost 8$ a month when the beta is over. For now the beta is only open for Mac users 
1 I have wow and Minecraft. So it’s safe to say I have 3-4K hours in both...
1 I gamed on a MacBook Pro in college because it was the only computer I owned. Other than the smaller selection of games to play, it wasn't too bad. I spent a lot of money on GoG.com though because older games generally ran better and I could use wineskin to make them compatible. I think my favorite gaming experience on the Mac was playing through the Half Life series start to finish over the course of a year. So much fun. 
1 Oof but you're playing PUBG
1 Sure it doesn't have pubg and overwatch but the steam/battle.net library is still not slacking on a Mac.
1 All my friends who own a Mac tell me about how they have all these apps for being creative and they try so hard to sell it to me.They're all psychology, business, and engineering majors that don't go beyond Microsoft Office. 
1 I almost didn't get it and right as I was about to scroll away, I looked down to check out her butt (out of habit, sue me) and I got it Booty saves the day

1 Oof
1 It’s funny for all of y’all shitting on Mac but if you knew how to upgrade your ram then you’d be quite 
1 You jest, but those silver Mac Pro's were fucking cool. Really expensive, and not gaming machines, but still really quite cool.

1 "What's a computer?"
1 I just bought a old G5 mac pro those things are a beast.
1 Depending on the model, that Mac is worth more than the PC she's playing the game on. Also, my 2010 Mac Pro handles games JUST FINE in both OSX and Windows. All I had to do was throw in a used GTX 970. 
0 Macs have a nicer interface and the base models can run games well. What’s the problem 
1 "I'm a cute camera chick who's so trendy yet unique but I don't understand basic things like fire prevention or how to crop a photo." Look at that rats nest under the table!

This combination creates incessant stressAnd compounds the affects of menstrual cramps."  Excerpt from "Women and Gaming: The Unreleased Studies, 1936
776 I bought a Mac once, specifically to cut down on my gaming.
116 I bought one because I wanted all the benefits of Linux without having to maintain it myself. Never looked back from having a Mac as my daily driver. I still have a gaming PC, but my laptops will always be a Mac. 
93 I know at least 3 people that bought a Macbook and all they do is complaining that they can't run games when they have nothing to do. And they usually have nothing to do. That leaves me thinking they actually bought the Macbook to play...
3 Their easier to program on somewhat. I've recently switched to Linux though for most of my computer work, though windows will always be my gaming OS.
2 I bought a mac, not originally to game, but i bought starcraft 2 for the Mac.Am i bad person?
2 I liked the Mac OS UI a lot. I bootcamped for games. I've had Macintosh for over 20 years before I decided to switch to Windows fully for good.
2 I have a Macbook and no issues playing RS on high graphics. That being said I would never buy COD or anything fancy by any means- i'd go console 1000% of the time
2 This idiot with a 2012 Mac Pro has a GeForce 1080, 32GB RAM, a PCIExpress SSD that does 1400MB/sec, can run macOS 10.13 and Windows 10 on its own dedicated SSD.  Dual Xeon 3.46Ghz.  Can play any modern title.  I even have USB3 on a PCI card.  The only thing I don’t have is Thunderbolt.  Big whoop.And in case you’re wondering, I got the Mac Pro used and just put money into upgrades.  
2 I've never heard someone want a Mac for gaming.
2 Cloud gaming is becoming a thing. For Macs there is GeForce NOW (currently free in beta) which let's you play on remote gaming servers with GTX 1080s.
-11 Games I'm currently playing on my 2014 Mac Mini:- Rocket League- Divinity: Original Sin- Human Fall Flat- The First Tree- OxenfreeYeah, some of these are a few years old, but I hadn't played them before, so they're new to me. The implication seems to be that lo-fi gaming is not "real" gaming. Most of the games I play are hugely discounted on Steam from their original prices, and I don't pay through the nose for hardware or new release, presales, collectors editions...Tell me again, who's paying the luxury tax here?
1 True enough, but this is still [a classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk8hxjpnUiw).  :)
1 What about using a Hackintosh for gaming?
1 Apple does mobile gaming. The apple tv 4k runs games incredibly smooth. Although theres not many. But theres a few that run console level graphics incredibly smooth. I’d definitely say it competes with last gen consoles or the switch.Guys i’m super serious. I can see apple entering the console wars by accident in a few updates. They should seriously push for publishing exclusives. Apple!! So much potential!Don’t believe me? The TV runs the iPad Pro hardware and probably with a boost to run 4k HDR.Check out (These look best on iPad Pro)Modern combat versusInfinite FlightBrightRidgeSG: Infinite JetsAlthough these games arent your AAA titles.I hope apple doesn’t make me eat my words, the only thing preventing apple from becoming a competitor in gaming is their lack of exclusives. And yeah pay to win games are trash. But atleast they’re free? 
1 Welllll 5 years ago I actually bought an iMac for gaming. I was taking a post graduate course with not a lot of time on hand to research and build a PC, and 1 year later I would need to move to other cities (without a car) which I had no idea where it would be so I wanted to have as few pieces of moveable hardware as possible, and I also desperately wanted to play Dark Souls which my Macbook Air could not handle at all. So I got the the 27inch iMac with GTX 680MX, and bootcamped it. It could play most modern 3D PC games on 1440p @60FPS (I could even play Witcher 3 at 45 FPS on 1080p), and moving houses with it was comparably convenient. It lasted for a good 4 years until I finally settled down with a real home so I could finally build a good fancy desktop to play games at 144hz. Even now I still have the iMac on my dining table for entertainment while having dinner. 
1 My first computer was a Macbook Pro. It was the most powerful computer that I could talk my grandparents into buying me "for school." I ran Windows 7 on it from day one, and it never let me down.
1 I didn't buy my Mac for gaming. But by god, it runs The Sims 4 and that's just fine by me.
1 Psst. since the latest os you can hook up the thunderbolt models to an external graphics card
1 Exactly you don't buy a mac for gaming, you buy the right tool for the right job. 
1 These guys would agree. https://youtu.be/IYv3-HfRNcA
1 They are not idiots. Steam has a whole store for Mac. Games with chill graphics works well on Mac. Pretty silly to call them idiots because they are on a different platform than you. It's like hating black people because they're black. 
1 Rich poeple and content generators.But when it comes to content generation like video editing, graphic design, and sound editing. Mac OS is pretty top notch paired with Final cut pro, Adobe products and Avid's Pro Tools. Used them all the time in college and the platform is great for it.Gaming is probably more an after thought really.
-17 Honestly, if anyone buys a Mac for gaming, they should have their right to using a computer revoked
-15 People who make games for Windows are idiots. Linux should be first priority, then MacOS and lastly windows. Windows doesn’t have the same feeling to it anymore, and Microsoft are becoming EA with their OS.Edit: funny that if I said that for MacOS people would’ve praised me. Liking windows over MacOS is just as bad as liking MacOS over windows. Both are commercial operating systems designed for the purpose of making money for the company. Linux on the other hand is an OS made for the sole purpose of having a good OS, with a distro for any kind of user. Unlike windows/MacOS with their single UI and single set of features.MacOS is made for content creating, and its really good at that, and as an OS, it’s also pretty good for games (not talking about hardware)Now windows.. well, it has a nice user base? Windows is just there. Nothing special about it, it costs money, security almost nonexistent. Probably the best thing it has is .NET.

103 >10 year old 40 year old girl/womanthought that was some kind of typo disaster. then i watched the commercial. how unfortunate.
52 I absolutely hate that commercial. It's a perfectly good commercial up until *that* line.  "What's a computer?". Shut the fuck up. I like Apple products but com'on Apple... And Oh I get it. Don't misinterpret my disdain for misunderstanding. Apple is saying that their iPads are so popular and a different user experience that future generations wont know what a (traditional) computer is. Hurr durr. I fucking get it. It's just stupid as shit. It's embarrassing for Apple because its so out of touch.This opinion brought to you by a person with an iPhone, iPad, and iWatch. All fine devices that I enjoy. But fuck me everyone knows what a fucking computer is mate. 
42 This comment made zero sense to me until I watched the ad. You explained it perfectly.
16 YES! I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS PISSED AT THIS. YOUR PHONE'S A COMPUTER AND YOUR TABLET IS DAMN WELL A COMPUTER BITCH.
11 > a 10 year old 40 year old girl/woman named MaudeI am kill
70 How drunk were you when you attempted that comment?Edit: Oh good lord that commercial. It makes sense now.
8 It's one of like 4 commercials that play on my Hulu. Which I keep on while I game because the missus and I enjoy the background noise. Every other commercial and even the shows that are on are just white noise to me. That sentence alone....I hear it loud and clear every time. It's always followed by a string of curses from me.
14 Oh my god do I hate this commercial.  It is like the epitome of what I hate about apple and the rank and file moron electronics user.Raising the next generation of baristas and crappy office drones who don't know what a browser is!  Apple!
51 *12yo/36yo gender fluid hipster autist
5 Nothing says "gaming" like an androgynous child-thing.
2 Yeah and they tried to do a TKAM reference but it fails completely 
2 Because I see that commercial everywhere, I have rewritten it in my head. It’s not “whats a computer?”, it’s “what computer?”  Like she’s using her iPad to do this bug webpage and not a full computer and is confused by the question.  They’re trying to sell that iPads can do everything laptops/desktops can do.
2 What are they even talking about? I watched the commercial and it's just.... Befuddling
3 Are you having a stroke?
2 I've never wanted to drop kick a child more in my entire life, Apple needs to get a new marketing team, their ads fucking suck ass
1 I really wanna give you gold for this analogy but I'm broke af.  
1 I guess I’m in the minority... It’s definitely marketing through and through, but I talk to people who are younger then me about this and they don’t talk in terms like “computer” like we used to. It’s PC, Mac, Tablet, Phone, etc. Many of them don’t even know what PC stands for.It may be weird and alien to us, but a lot of it is becoming true.
1 When that piece of shit can run FL Studio (properly, at least) then may give it a second look. 
-11 Since when is an ipad the same as a computer?
102 Yeah, but so *design* !    See ? the corners are all roundy. *design*
9 Wow I didn't see the joke until this comment 
1 It's probably a G5, it costs more to run for five minutes than it does to buy it second hand
1 But it's diamond cut chamfered aluminum. <3
1 you can get those G5 macs for like $5 or free , so they are actually cheaper than a folding card table chair in most cases 
1 Took me until this comment for me to go back and get the joke. 
20 The "handles" are a little sharp, but the interior design is quite spiffy.
5 I find it amusing that they chose the last Mac with a fully upgradeable body to make this image.  It's the Mac best suited for gaming, oddly.I actually have an old 8-core Xeon Mac Pro with that body that I've decked out with 24 GB RAM and a modern PCIe video card and dual-booted with Windows 10.  We use it as our secondary gaming PC for co-op and multiplayer (like Overwatch LAN parties).  Works as good as any PC with the same card.
1 I actually have a 2008 model that’s a surprisingly good gaming rig with a newer GPU and W10. Unfortunately, Apple no longer supports this model so I can’t upgrade to newer macOS without modifying the installer.
1 It amazes me that the first Power Mac G5 tower design was in 2003 and still looks pretty "new" today. They used the same design until 2012 when they replaced it with the trash can. 
1 I always loved that case design. I want to use one on my next build. 
125 It's such a low brow argument posting it on a sub like r/gaming is bound to get you tons of karma lol
8 As a network admin, that would be great if every drop out now warehouse worker/door knob salesman that starts working here wasn't trying to explain to me why we should be using macs and iPhones.
36 Pretty much this. I have the latest iMac, fully decked out. It was worth every penny to me. It’s wicked fast and I can play Mac games or Windows-based games via Bootcamp. I get the best of both worlds. Plus, it’s whisper quiet and fricking gorgeous.

1 > it has been going on for a decadelol
1 Oh well, any reason is good for companies like ROG to drop an ad and get some "organic" advertising going on Reddit. ;)
2 A decade?  You just dated yourself.  I’ve been having this stupid argument for 20+ years and I’ve lived on both sides of it. 
1 No coz Macs are shit.
1 We need more ppl like you :)
1 But but but I prefer [x] and I am very smart so anyone who likes [y] made the wrong choice !?Right?Right?
-1 > Buy the computer you want. Let other people buy the computer they want.Or buy a mac and have both in one. Seems kinda like a no-brainer if you have the cash.
0 The real argument should be fedora vs ubuntu. 
0 Yeah, at this point you can do literally anything you want on a mac, PC, or linux machine. There's very little you cannot do between each system. The only reason to pick one over the other is personal preference, or proprietary software. 
-1 Yup... And not everyone buys a computer for gaming. I have both Macs and PCs, and each are used for specific tasks that work best on either platform - or certain software that is Mac-only or Windows-only.I'll use my PS4 for games and any toy most costly than that had better have wheels and an engine.
7 There is no "debate". Just the occasional circlejerk post like this one.
7 And now people call me a Microsoft fanboy for having a SP4, like WTF I just hate the touch bar and Windows has an acceptable POSIX environment now. No matter what I use it's wrong. Use what works. I don't bitch at sports car drivers for not being able to haul shit
26 Exactly everyone knows Linux is the superior one. 
30 I'm curious as to why it could ever be a debate.  Lets compare all Personal computers to this one specific overpriced brand of personal computer, just cause it has it's own operating system.
1 Right? I like how this girl has a custom acrylic cased watercooled rig with perfectly bent rigid tubing but can't roll up a damn extension cord. 
1 Bothersome 
106 Do you remember the Express card slot you never use in the old laptops? They can be used to connect external graphic cards too, but the external GPUs are never portable, as they need their own PSU so they'll be only slightly lighter than a micro ATX PC.So saying that these external GPU let you game on the go is just not feasible.
6 I had no idea, definitely interesting to hear. It seems unlikely that apple will ever make a budget build, just isn't their demographic 
11 The question isn't "how" to turn a mac into a gaming computer, it should be "why".
3 What's a computer?
9 This is true, however in typical apple fashion the support is years behind the trend. 10 series nvidia gpus are like 12 months old 
8 Also the majority of games are incompatible with IOS software. Welp. I was a hardcore Mac Gamer when Minecraft was at its prime in like 2015.
3 Apple clearly doesn't care much for gaming on Mac, on a software level the support is still pretty bad. There's a day and night difference between running a game on MacOS versus running it through bootcamp on the same exact machine. Like, my Macbook makes for a serviceable on the go gaming machine when running Windows 10 but while running MacOS it gets pretty bad performance. Metal doesn't come close to Vulkan or DirectX in gaming performance.I love my MacBook for what I use it for but it's far from being a good gaming machine, even with a Thunderbolt GPU enclosure I'd be far better off just running Windows and if I were to run Windows why would I be using a mac in the first place?
2 > And well, they've never made a budget anything really.The late Steve Jobs said they were never going to go to that market segment, and he was right. As soon as you're starting the race to the bottom you're competing with the guys who have their parts screwed inside an enclosure in some backyard shack by a guy who makes enough money to buy food once every two days.There are cheap Android machines, yes, but they are universally shit and crappy experiences to work with.Apple has never had the ambition to be the best of the junkyard. Nobody makes money in that segment. There's no innovation in that segment, because they're not making money to do any real R&D.I prefer a good device that's going to last me a good long while over something I have to renew every year. 
1 Now if they can just give you a user-friendly way to turn off mouse acceleration that persists after a reboot.
1 The Mac mini is super reasonably priced. The iPhone SE (one I use) is reasonably priced also. That’s about their only two budget products but both are awesome. If anyone wants to game on a Mac it needs to be older games. Just buy a gaming PC if you want computer games. Not a laptop a desktop. My PC is my nice toy for video games and I use my Mac for actual work. 
-3 Exactly, too expensive. It's true that you can use an external enclosure to game with a Mac, but how is that a good thing? Not only are you purchasing an overpriced and under powered laptop, but you also need to buy the separate enclosure AND on top of that, a graphics card. This is not appealing when there are laptops out there that have high-end desktop graphics cards literally INSIDE of them out-of-the-box.Also I feel like you're overestimating the portability of an external graphics enclosure. If you want to do this, you've got to lug around a $900 cube with your Mac, assuming you get a 1080ti. Of course you could just get the Mac Pro to game at home. The only problem is that this high-performance trash can is designed to be a workstation, so you're literally wasting your dollars to buy this computer when you could build a better performing gaming PC for cheaper(well actually you could build a better performing workstation for cheaper too but that's irrelevant).Combine this with the fact that desktop macs are hardly upgrade-able compared to PCs, the only incentive for a gamer to get a Mac is in the case of a fan boy.
-2 You don't know how to external gpu enclosure work do you?  Lol.
2 I could be wrong but I thought the G5 was single optical. So this would be a Mac Pro. 
2 I love that case design. Hard to believe it's a 14 year old machine.
1 unless you’re playing Marble Blast
0 Yeah except that there’s only like 5 games on steam that can run on a Mac. Source: I have a Mac
1 haha, that reliable sienna can't beat my DIY mazda rx-7 LOLOLOLOL guess it's only good for sitting in, you might as well not even drive it. 
152 Because if you buy a Mac that could actually run games, you would have no money left for them anyways. 
8 Combination of hardware / software issues mainly that has led Mac's to not be ideal for gaming.1st. Hardware support. if you look at the majorty of Apple computers in the last 5+ years, none of them are modular allowing for the addition of necessary graphics processors. The last tower Apple had that could take a standard GPU was the Mac Pro "cheese grater" tower, which was last released in 2012. It was not aimed at gamers however and was fairly expensive for just gaming on. (however many people still have these, and earlier models with modern GPU's and game fine on them).Since then, Virtually all of Apple's products have been locked boxes, with soldered on mobile parts. The iMac's used low end mobile GPU's (for the higher end models) and the rest of the models used intel's integrated processors. The same goes for their laptop range. Even their "most powerful macbook pro" now, uses a fairly low end Radeon 550, which could game, but really wasn't intended for it.secondly, up until recently, Apple's API's for graphics and gaming acceleration were lackluster. Without the ability to use DirectX, Apple was relying on OpenGL platform for gaming, which was slow to adopt new features and ended up not keeping up performance wise with modern DirectX. This meant that developers who did create Apple versions of their games using OpenGL would see far weaker performance or less featuresets available to them. Apple has since tried to remedy this by creating their own set of API's, Metal, but I'm not currently sure how it fairs against DirectX 11 or 12. Previously, running the same game between WIndows and MacOS, you'd see significant performance degradation just running on MacOS. I did some gaming tests on both a MacBook Air and my desktop running MacOS and Windows (prior to metal) And running in MacOS would see anywhere from 20-50% performance hit just based on the OS. For example, World of Warcraft ran at 1080p on ultra in windows @ 60fps (vsync enabled), but would barely keep over 30fps on MacOS on the same hardware. On my MacBook air showed similar results.this, led to developers just not giving a flying fuck about making sure their games were OSx compatible. the market wasn't there. THe hardware wasn't capable. It led to the now infamous quote from the Oculous rift founder saying they'd support apple when Apple had a computer that was decent. But it meant there just weren't a lot of games made for OSx. The market was just not big enough for them to even put up with that (Apple's actual OS share of the market is still < 10% of computer users)
44 Because instead of dumping 3grand on a Mac you can spend 1500 building/buy a great rig and spend another 1500 on games.
11 More people on Windows
3 I've never owned an apple product, but to me it seems like if you built your own computer, getting similar specs in a Mac would cost you much more money. And I can upgrade my hardware in any way I want.
9 Games don’t run as well on the OSX architecture and there’s often little room for upgrades. Also, none of them have a great graphics card so significantly more gamers are on windows. That makes it to where the Apple platform isn’t as profitable so many companies don’t expect to see much return for the extra work it’d take. That and Apple really shot themselves in the foot when it came to marketing to this demographic. Underpowered hardware (where it counts) and apples marketing that cut into the Apple gamer population just set them up for failure in the gaming world. I was using an iMac for 4 years before I finally decided to build a PC and man am I glad I got that PC. I loved how streamlined the apple experience was, but it’s nice to have some power under the hood. If Apple started selling computers with solid GPUs and marketed them appropriately I’m sure they’d get more attention. 
2 Because historically Macs have never been built to be customizable enough to the extent you would want for actual gaming. Until just recently, there was no cost and resource-effective way to install a high-end GPU in a Mac. Even now it's still arguably not worth the effort. 
1 Apple doesn't design with gaming in mind, and game support for non-directX platforms is still new. 
1 Looking at Steam, there are currently [just under 6,000 games available on MacOS](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&os=mac), compared to the [18,300 games for Windows](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&os=win) and [~4,000 games on Linux](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&os=linux). Most AAA games don't launch on Mac initially, but a fair number of them are ported over within a year or so, usually through either Feral Interactive, Aspyr, or one of a few other large third-party porting companies. To add to this, some engines (especially Unity) provide Mac and Linux support out of the box, which makes it quite easy for smaller indie games to be ported over.That said, one of the main issues is that Apple has not updated their version of OpenGL for quite some time, instead focusing on their Metal API. They also haven't adopted Vulcan. This makes porting games more difficult as there isn't a shared graphics library to help with that. Simply updating OpenGL would help devs a lot, and adopting Vulcan might actually encourage some companies to actually port their games.
1 Microsoft courted game programmers in the *'90s* by making it easier for them to make games (Direct X, Visual Studio). Apple has done nothing like that until Metal. But why would any game programmer learn Metal for 5-8% of the PC market? MacOS has older outdated OpenGL. Macs are also mostly running integrated GPUs or mobile GPUs if you're rich.On top of that, the majority of programmers (webdev being the anomaly), I believe, hate Macs.

2 It's pretty ballsy of you to link to a video of you trying out battlefront 2 on your mac.  Either one is sufficient to get you downvoted to oblivion.
3 I tried gaming on my old MacBook Air... it 'just' about played Euro Truck Sim 2, if you didn't mind it getting stuttery at times and turning into a slideshow when you got into cities.    It was surprising it did that much; you can't expect too much from a slimline laptop with 4gb ram and onboard graphics!
1 Nope, plenty of us here. It doesn't make sense to buy a Mac strictly for gaming, but if you have it for other reasons, you can still play a lot of great games. I miss out on a lot of titles, of course, but I already have more good ones than I have time for.I play, I have fun, and I enjoy not having to spend time on Windows or hardware config. Lots of people are fine with doing that, but it's an easy cost to overlook.
0 F
1 My 2017 imac does very well with all the games I've thrown at it so far; with the AMD pro 580 I'm running games at 1080/1440p with ultra settings. Couldn't imagine the imac pro to do much worse.
2 There’s no way you are ever getting a girlfriend.
1 That's PUBG.
2 There is technically gaming on mac I know for example there are game engines that port direct to mac without too much effort like Unity. I don't know too much about them on the technical front though, it may well be just down to preference, I'm sure there's some video somewhere explaining it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWxmhNn-jo

2 Poor salty boy, it’ll be okay buddy.
0 If you're saying PC gamers don't piss enough (underutilized penis)*, you're damn straight.All y'all mofos better remember to stay hydrated, and don't hold it in when you need to go. That public raid in destiny 2 isn't worth a kidney stone. And buy a mic, stop being antisocial. Nobody got time to read the chat when you're getting flanked.*applies to all genders though, stop underutilizing your bladder. Go piss
1 Macs for video editing is the only way. 
2 PC does it better just like race cars go faster and perform better than a reliable day to day car. Like I care about gaming on my mac. I know i can't race my toyoya sienna against your DIY Mazda RX-7.
1 I think the main argument is basically price/performance ratio. PCs, at least historically, tend to have similar specs at lower price points. Also it used to be much easier to build a custom pc than a custom mac, which cuts down on the price by upwards of 30%.
5 Fuck off creep
1 She can game on this dick!
0 Lol
1 We portioned ours. 25% mac, 75% dota
1 Nah
3 Good thing you can also easily install windows on a Mac and play fortnite

0 being reliable in any situation? Even as a seat? I guess everything down to their structure is top notch. 
4 I pretty sure everything that is achieved with a mac is first achieved digitally.
0 Yeah on opposite day
1 Well I have played more hours in Minecraft and Borderlands on my old MBP than I have on my built PC. An i7 and an Nvidia 330M is still enough for truly fun games. I think you should get a dick out of your ass and lighten up.

1 LOLOL! GTFO with them great jokes of yours!!
1 *You* should be in the kitchen.
258 I bought one once because it was half off and I needed something to work on and figured it was time to learn how to fix problems on OSX. I havent had any problems. People who do would probably fry a pc with the sheer frequency of ID-10T errors. Safari literally warns you when youre looking at a BS page now not to look at it. Yet somehow people still end up believeing fake warnings and installing malware... 
6 I have worked remote for most of my career.  I specifically keep a Linux laptop with a shitty graphics system around for work so I don't suddenly say, "Fuck this," and fire up Skyrim.
2 how did that go? I bought my mac for the same reason but built a gaming PC like two months later.
2 Why not just... not install games?
7 This. 
1 I bet your redditting went waaay up
1 I did too. Unfortunately WoW is available on Mac. Most AAA MMO’s get a Mac port. Pretty much all my favorite games have been available, but I am back to using a PC.
1 I did this too, but then I found out about OpenEmu and dolphin for older games, and suddenly all of that went out of the window lol
1 I bought one once because I hate money and was tired of setting it on fire
1 Key word "once"
1 This is the reason I switched most of my computers over to Linux.
42 I feel like this is how the computing world is shaping up. Macs as the  laptop for creative stuff and little upkeep needed while on the go. Desktop for gaming and having a powerhouse at home.
15 I consider macOS a Linux distro with awesome UI and device integrations.
12 Exactly. It's *nix under the hood and the GUI just works. I'm the same, I have an expensive gaming pc that I only use for gaming but anything else the mac is just better. People compare shitty $500 laptops to macs and say macs are expensive. When you compare something of similar build quality they really aren't that much more pricey. Also, windows as an every day OS just sucks and I would hate to ever have to use it for 8 hours a day (Besides gaming).
8 Same.. Being able to drop into a native shell is my #1 reason for wanting a Mac. Windows Powershell?, uh no thanksGaming on a Mac isn't *that* desolate these days though. There's hundreds of games on Steam, but it's fair to say Apple neglected the CPU/GPU in their models for way too long.I get my FPS fix from consoles, which suits me as I already spend way too much time hunched over a keyboard anyway
1 Same setup, but my gaming pc has dual boot with Hackintosh.Best of both worlds
1 You might want to give Windows Services for Linux (aka Bash on Ubuntu on Windows) a try. It's pretty good. But it's definitely a Windows subsystem, not woven through the OS like MacOS is.
0 I haven't had any issues with Ubuntu as a daily driver. It's when I try to develop stuff, I start breaking stuff.
0 Yeah used to do Mac laptops too until they really started skimping on hard drive space/$. Got an XPS 15 and love it. Coworker just said yesterday, "oh that's not a Mac... It looks better." 
0 I waited so patiently for them to release a MBP with good specs when I bought my Dell XPS last year. I just couldn’t spend $2700 on a machine with old hardware. Bought my maxed out XPS 15 and a month later they announced the sky lake MBPs.
-1 Elementary o/s looks and works very much like a mac. 
-2 It's bloody UNIX.
112 Bootcamp that shit.
3 They can get an external GPU. But they’re not cheap. 
1 They just need to learn how to run bootcamp.
3 Yeah, I would say a majority of web devs nowadays are on macs.
1 Nothing wrong with that though rts isn't my personal cup o tea
31 Ho much did that Mac cost?
29 The people who get to play the games they actually want to?
18 You.You're paying more for the hardware to run what you want to run, on a platform with less robust support/patching, where some games are not supported at release gating your ability to enjoy the content you want.Internally justifying that by claiming the ability to buy old games on sale as some magical benefit is odd.
1 divinity original sin c: great game
0 You overpaid for the hardware you got in your 2014 Mac Mini. Like, way overpaid. Even a 2017 Mac Mini tops out with a dual-core i5 and onboard graphics for $1000. If you want a Mac and you don't mind paying for it that's fine, but claiming you didn't pay a luxury tax is just ridiculous.
-1 You are what I call an iDiot
-10 so... ignorance is bliss? you play titles I wouldnt even touch because of how bad they are but thats the best in your world. nice
2 my mac couldn't even run angry birds! (not kidding, it used some opengl version that was too new for my mac)
-3 You are a loser.
6 I mean yeah, Windows 10 is utter garbage nowadays, especially when compared to Linux/OSX, but from a commercial standpoint its still the by-far most used platform. Linux is not as accessible/easy to use for most people and Macs (even though they are great for work) are way too expensive.
2 really tempted to downvote this post, but then I decided that you should live with your shame.

26 It's so pretentious I almost shat it my own mouth.
2 Butt fuck you? Alright if you insist..
1 That's basically been my relationship with apple since I started modding 4th Gen iPods.  They make a good product with a great user experience but they let that fact swell both their head's and dicks and put out shit like that commercial.  It's so infuriating because a part of you feel like's your tactically supporting this shit.
5 Most of my comments are that way.
10 My fucking fridge is a computer these days.
43 Watch the commerical and it'll make perfect sense
6 Is it 'computing' for you now?
1 Do you game on a computer? Or whatever maude was using?
1 This is me with football on Sundays. That commercial gets played at least 4 times a game. 3 sets of games over the course of the day, thats like 12 times I hear the stupid shit in a single day.
2 Is it wrong to dropkick a child if they were just reading a script?
11 so...Portlander?
1 I missed it, her hair is completely 'Aunt Joan' from a 1980 party and it threw me off my observation skills.
1 > They’re trying to sell that iPads can do everything laptops/desktops can do.Which are computers, as is an iPad, an iPhone, an iWatch, an iSore, iETC, iETC, iETC.
1 Maybe they wanted to do this, stir the shit? My gf hates the commercial, I don't, because it bought me so much sweet Karma and I happen to like that girls hair and eyeglasses. Now, the 'What's a computer part'? Yeah, I really don't know.. I try to understand, but hell an old calculator is techincvally a computer because it computes simple maths.I don't know.
13 Only on my labtop computer
2 A question that should have been asked of whoever made that ad.
1 They're so hit and miss... i'm guessing they use different agencies or production companies or something. I love that Balloons one, and the 'couple in empty Shanghai' one, but this one does my head in. There's such a massive shift in tone and style across some of their commercials that they must have, like, A and B teams of creatives or something, rather than one cohesive campaign.
11 When you want to promote the iPad as a viable option. For the most part, it's not. Also, for the price of the iPad pro you could get a perfectly viable computer.
5 What's a computer?
4 A computer is a device that stores and processes data. Your phone, tablet, router, smart home devices are all computers. Every iPad is a computer. Apple is saying that it's a good thing children want their products without the slightest idea of what they are. 
10 Since when has an iPad ever *not* been a computer? 
4 iPads may not be traditional desktop computers, but they are absolutely computers.
-2 You've earned my first downvote in, I don't know how long.
1 Round corners on everything was cute in 2007. I'm pretty sure it's gone out of style by now. 
1 Chairs have been around for years but Apple was just working on perfecting them to make them revolutionary.
1 Oh good I'm not the only one. I zoomed in on the screen like "yea, I guess it's pretty crappy graphics..." lol
66 It belongs in r/GamingCirclejerk or r/ComedyCemetery tbh
-6 I like the fairly upvoted random transphobia farther upthread too, literally out of nowhere. What the fuck is this sub.
3 Working in enterprise IT = I really don’t give a shit about Android v iPhone, Mac v Linux v Windows, nVidia v AMD shit...It’s all the same junk, and I don’t want to debate with you about which is better. I don’t care, I’m not 12 any more.
14 That's why I hackintoshed. Quality of life with day to day operations on the Mac side and gaming on windows when I need it.
5 This... does not contribute to the point 
1 You still could of bought a pc for the same price thats 2-3x times faster ofc it runs smooth but it could run smoother
-3 I did the same thing for the same reasons. Most of the games I play run under MacOS anyways.  I spent $3000 on a computer because I thought it was pretty.   Bite my brushed aluminum ass if you have a problem with that. 
-1 Plus there’s native eGPU support coming any day now, so gaming on a Mac will actually be a thing. 
1 im a computer
1 *your mind* 
3 And now you know what it's felt like to own a Mac.
1 lol. I love the sports car analogy 😂 
3 I've always wanted to support Linux in this fight because it certainly sounds like the logical extreme of what I'd want. Lots of customization opportunities if you want them, without sacrificing the ease of use of other platforms if you don't. (edit: and the OS is free. Can't beat free).But I'm way too lazy to learn how to use a new system (even though I do know the basics of unix based systems) and I don't want to have to wait extra long for games to be released on the platform. But mostly the lazy thing.
0 Noob. VMS is where it's at. 
36 Let’s see here bud. If you like Apple you like Apple. If you don’t you don’t.  Seems pretty cut and dry to me. 
3 "I'm curious as to why it could ever be a debate, given that my opinion must be right"
6 Own OS designed to run on the hardware as well. It is also part of an ecosystem. A Dell laptop and an HP laptop aren't all that different, but compared to a more expensive MacBook Pro, they are not the same, so there is a comparison to be made to see what you get for the extra cost. For most people, a Dell will be fine. For some, a Windows PC is needed. For those they have the money and don't need a Windows PC, a MacBook is viable and reliable option. Of course there is a culture of people having Macs because "Apple", but as a former Apple hater, I tried them and fell in love. From an iPod touch to my last MacBook. I still use an iPhone SE today though I built a PC purely for the upgrade ability and the lower price/power ratio. Thankfully Windows 10 has been much more reliable that my old experiences with Vista and XP. My Macs ran Windows so well that I never experienced a failure. So in short, there is a comparison to be made that a Mac is one type of computer and Windows PCs are another type, each with pros and cons.
41 Spot on man! And who the hell really wants to carry their full size gpu around with them or have to plug and play a gpu anyway.. Just have a pc and put in inside..
5 I never really thought of eGPUs as gaming on the go, more game at home and have a small laptop to bring for school/work/travel.  Do they actually market them as portable?
6 [Welcome to the future!](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&O=&Q=&ap=y&c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=CjwKCAiApJnRBRBlEiwAPTgmxB6BzNqSaXcDoABCO438Bk7LkeRxBHDpIHOABnKuX1DhdH99M4QPiBoCvkQQAvD_BwE&is=REG&m=Y&sku=1351470)
1 Yeah, i've got a old laptop that is actually a beast of a machine, but the GPU just utterly sucks. Really debating about doing that to it. Except i don't really have a reason except for maybe a backup gaming computer if mine fails.
1 So the idea is that you have a laptop for the road and an eGPU to plug in when you're at home at your desk.
1 I don't know man, the aorus gaming box is quite portable.
-1 Plus there's barley any decent games that support Mac anyways 
2 > It seems unlikely that apple will ever make a budget buildThe reason is that it's the race to the bottom. They can never win that, it dilutes the brand and definitely the profit margin. Also, not unimportant,, 'budget builds' are typically inferior experiences.One of my acquaintances, for whom the computer is an evil machine, and it was easy to see why, had a machine [windows XP] that was set to 800x600 resolution, which is as crap to look at as that sounds. So, I opened the control panel to change those settings so that she'd at least have a bit of a better experience.... fuck... me... harder800x600 is *the only* resolution she had. Her machine could not do better [and this is not 20 years ago].You get computing for 'a lot less money', yes, no doubt about it. It's also a craptastic experience.Apple has never wanted to go down that path [and it is *down* that path], and they know why.The upshot is that you can get a machine that is truly fun to work with.I have been using a Mac for 21 years, I have never once regretted it. It's true that software used to be an issue, but that hasn't been the case for many years now.
9 So you dont have to buy two systems? 
11 Are 11 series+ nvidia gpus abandoning PCI-E? If not, you're going to have to explain the relevance of your point. 
3 iOS or macOS? iOS has tons of games because it's what powers iPhone. macOS is what runs on laptops and desktops, use to be OS X
6 I start to understand why that is. I started learning to make software for iOS a few months ago. I only had an old iphone 4s for testing so I focused on arm7 processors as it was bascially supported on all devices. Then they dropped support in September making sure my software stops working on all new iOS versions (even though it would technically work just fine) :| They also don't seem to support writing software that works outside their Apple world making it very hard to reuse code between apple and other platforms 
1 2 gears ago was mine craft prime? Are you sure you didn't drop 4years on accident? 
-1 Unless you're trying to keep up with the newest games, you shouldn't have to renew your PC like that. I've a gaming laptop, which wasn't top-of-the-line, from 3 years ago that still does wonderfully for games that aren't Destiny 2 or Tera on max graphics. Macs are just expensive and maintain their resale value due to the brand and set-in-stone way they're built (you typically cant customize them after purchase). That said, I've seen many a Mac shatter and crack due to bad build quality. Maybe they've gotten better, but I see PCs last as long if not longer when they're chosen intelligently.
2 >  the only incentive for a gamer to get a Mac is in the case of a fan boy.This is a stupid argument. Nobody buys a Mac to do Apple a favour. Is it so hard to believe that a Mac has at least enough redeeming qualities that people should want to own one? All those tens of millions of people don't know what they're doing?
1 Sorry to rob you of potential catharsis but there's nothing for me to argue with here. There is no argument that Apple is truly serious about appealing to the average gamer. I do know one graphics professional who uses a Macbook pro and he's definitely benefiting from this setup(1070 card) with his job. It's more portable than a PC, and seems to suit him well. 
3 Feel free to correct me if you have more than a 'Lol' floating around up there. 
2 I've actually checked as Steam tells you that type of thing and it's definitely more than 5 or 10.It's better to be a post Steam-era mac user. Vulkan API might enable (encourage) more cross platform support going forward.
-16 A modern Mac can run any modern game in the absolute lowest settings and sill get ~40 fps. The problem is that the difference in GPU power between there low end models and their high end models isn’t very significant. They put more money into the cpu, RAM, and storage. Hopefully with the thunderbolt standard becoming open or USB-C becoming more prevalent we can see commercial computers that can handle an external GPU expansion. It’d be awesome to buy a laptop with a beefy motherboard/CPU/PSU that could run new games on ultra with an external unit hooked up. And I think this would open new possibilities for Apple gamers. Edit: what’d I say? Am I misinformed about something or did I just tick off a certain group? Edit2: Now I get it. This post looks like I'm defending apples prices and saying it's a solid gaming option. That's not what I was doing. I agree that apple is overpriced and a bad option for gaming, I just disagreed with the other commentators reasoning. The GPU across mac tiers isn't all that different in terms of power. You'll get a comparable gaming experience between all tiers of apple products because the GPU is by far the biggest bottleneck. So there isn't any such thing as buying an expensive enough mac for gaming like he said because that's not something apple makes. 
-25 The only reason that is is because no one optimizes games for mac. I have a better computer specs wise than my friend but he runs some games better
1 > secondly, up until recently, Apple's API's for graphics and gaming acceleration were lackluster. Without the ability to use DirectX, Apple was relying on OpenGL platform for gaming, which was slow to adopt new features and ended up not keeping up performance wise with modern DirectX. This meant that developers who did create Apple versions of their games using OpenGL would see far weaker performance or less featuresets available to them. Apple has since tried to remedy this by creating their own set of API's, Metal, but I'm not currently sure how it fairs against DirectX 11 or 12. Previously, running the same game between WIndows and MacOS, you'd see significant performance degradation just running on MacOS.The switch to Metal has only made Apple's problems even worse, as no other platform supports Metal. If you built your game for OpenGL and now Vulkan you get Windows, Linux, and Android compatibility, plus I think the Playstation and Nintendo APIs were similar to OpenGL and now support Vulkan. If you built on DirectX you got Windows and Xbox support. If you build on Metal, the only compatibility you get is OS X and iOS, and it seems very unlikely that Apple will support Vulkan in the future.If Vulkan catches on, as it seems like it might, we may well see more Linux support in the future than Mac (which is just pathetic), because porting a game built on Vulkan to Linux will be much easier and cheaper than porting the graphics backend to Metal.
4 Tbf most people buying a great rig at $1,500 are not purchasing a 5K screen as well.
5 Yeah, but then I'd be stuck with Windows and fuck that. 
-1 And you would have to use Windows.Gross.
1 You ever heard of Bootcamp? A mac and PC is the same inside, they are just wrapped in different BIOS/OS.
1 You don't need a Mac Pro for gaming. A Mac Pro is a workstation. You could easily get a mid-range iMac for $1300 and it'll run quite a few things just fine (although the graphics card may be a bit lackluster). Go up to the $1800 model and you get a 5k monitor and a much better graphics card which can run just about anything without any issue.
1 WAT? I have a Mac Pro at home from 2010 and I dropped in a used GTX 970 and I run Battlefield 4 on full Ultra settings. And that computer is 7 fucking years old!

1 She's using a short range weapon (UMP) in the middle of a big ass field when she has an M416 on her players back.This picture just has gurl gamer bullshit all over it.

6 Bill's PC is like a lot faster in my experience, as long as you don't mind the Pokémon 
1 public personal information capsule
1 Personal computer, as opposed to cult status symbol.
1 Thank you for reminding me!My steak is almost done.
182 There's this weird misconception that Macs somehow can't get viruses or malware.
2 I'm thinking about buying a mac for the same reason. Were you able to find a decently-priced one for your purposes?
1 in order to down load a non recognized software you have to go through 40 prompts. how do you install malwear on a mac  
1 People are fucking dumb. 
1 I mean every mainstream browser earns you about scam pages. Problem is that as networks are used to place malware on usually completely legit sites.Of course almost nobody writes malware for MacOS, so you are safe there.
2 Try to play dwarf fortress on your shitty Linux machine ,  It is a Black hole and it runs over cmd 
1 But I'm also addicted to a very light running game, Duelyst, so that doesn't help me
12 This was my philosophy for a while, until Mac laptops got too pricey for my tastes.
3 They're unnecessarily expensive for little on the go things, you can pay half the price and get a Windows laptop that does the exact same thing and is actually compatible with corporate software.
1 My pc is gaming & my laptop is a Mac. I think that’s the only way to go honestly. Still love macOS & prefer it but for gaming i’ll deal with windows
1 Not just creative stuff. Most tech orgs I’ve worked in... 90% of the dev machines are macs.
5 I believe that there is few us that don't care enough about the 'open source/proprietary' debate, but do care about having a proper command line interface.
1 OSX is a distribution of Unix, like Linux is
-1 But OS X isn't a Linux distro at all. It's based on NeXTstep, which is fundamentally different from Linux and predates it by a decent amount of years.
2 I own a Macbook Pro but that's kinda rubbish. The base price for a current gen Macbook Pro 15' model is 2300 euros. Comes with an integrated graphics card. I'm sure you can find similar specs for PC laptops for AT LEAST 1k less. 1k is a lot of money to me, maybe it's just pocket change to you though.
1 I bought an x1 carbon(used) for 430 bucks and I can say that it is better than the mac I had. I put linux on it because I don't like w10
-3 I'm sure a lot of people do but I compare my $1000 gaming rig to a mac and feel that they're obscenely expensive because my PC can outperform anything up to $2000 macs. That's probably the same kind of sentiment you'll hear from most PC gamers
4 > There's hundreds of games on SteamThousands, even.  Mostly thanks to the fact that unity makes producing a mac build alongside your windows build pretty easy.And a bunch of blizzard games run on OS X too.  And minecraft.So, yeah, there's plenty of stuff to play on your macbook when you're on the go.
45 I sure did. I completed Black Ops 2 and Borderlands on my 2010 MBP. Played countless hours of minecraft and Mount and Blade. Probably more than I have played on my PC I built for gaming still.I didn't buy the MBP for gaming but it worked for it just fine, and it lasted 7 years, more actually as the guy who bought it is still using it.
89 Shhhh.. you're ruining the anti-apple circlejerk by mentioning built-in services/applications. 
8 [GEforce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/mac-pc/) is also pretty interesting, as an alternative.
2 I still play Skyrim on my imac. Bootcamp rules. 
2 Bootcamp isn't going to save a laptop with a 5w CPU.  
-4 Right??? I mean the thing can run mac and windows... better than a pc
2 Yeah, but it's a great move for laptops. 
12 Cool. Then let's all just spend our money on the things that make us happy.If investing in a sweet gaming rig is your jam, go for it.
1 Mac mini's are entry level Macs. Let's not act like he's playing on a $2400 5k 27" i7 iMac or Mac Pro.A 2014 Mac mini is probably running Intel graphics and an i5 so it is what it is.
2 I mean, I play borderlands 2, bioshock, system shock 2 on my 2010 27" iMac. Are you gonna say those games suck? If you do, I'd have to wonder what kind of gamer you are.
1 Macs are garbage, absolutely, but Oxenfree, Rocket League, and Human Fall Flat are fucking awesome!
1 Upgrade your OS. That game should runnon every Intel Mac.
-9 No, people who game on a Mac are losers. 
1 I don’t believe Linux is any harder to use than windows. Ubuntu has (or at least had) a really user-friendly UI and a Visual package manager (comparable to windows store), mint is also very similar to windows. The average user doesn’t really have to do much in a Linux system, and I’m pretty sure “sudo apt-get install <program>” is much easier then finding it on google.Linux is also more accessible to everyone, since the only thing you pay for is the 4 gigs flash drive.Support-wise, I believe people who enjoy what they do produce better code than people who get paid for it and just want their work day to end, and with more people using it, more people will contribute.Right now, the only advantage windows have is that it’s the most used OS, and people are afraid to make a change. The saddest thing is that Microsoft can do what EA did and get away with it.

51 Holy shit, I've never seen this before. What are they even going for there? 
108 Guh.Fuck that shit.
152 So this commercial is basically saying kids are stupid... 
34 Why is Barb on a mac trailer?
26 Did she leave her bike on the bus? 
22 I hate that commercial so goddamned much. YOU KNOW WHAT A COMPUTER IS YOU LITTLE SHIT, you're just being a fucking smug asshole
86 It's kinda sad that she's going from place to place doing nothing but using her iPad. Even for the small window of time it takes to order a coffee she has that shit propped up on the counter. Instead of like...experiencing the world and meeting new people, and all that.And that's not just the ad, that's perfectly accurate to real life. Pretty scary.
58 dur.. wah am book? am kid dont know things about world and stuff  jokes aside, I can see this becoming the norm some time with in the next decade. I do "tech support" for a large phone carrier and I'd say about half the calls that require a pc for some task or another typically are from people who ask "can we use my ipad? I dont have a computer".      phones and tablets are becoming the norm for every day social and entertainment purposes. eventually workstations, desktops, and laptops will only be owned by people who actually need to do real work with them and I imagine eventually just word processing and general school work will probably not be included in that eventually.  you'll only see them used by people who make content. video editing, cgi and 2d animations, music producing, photo editing, digital art, software development and programming, auto cad, server and network development/maintenance.      the only other place I see traditional Desktop/PC setups staying in the homes is for the dedicated enthusiasts and PC gamers including but not limited to those involved in esports and competitive scenes.   
5 Looks like a young barb from Stranger Thinges s1
7 Holy shit, I see what he means by 10 year old, 40 year old.
6 The real question is why a 10 year old is riding round with an iPad Pro that costs $900+? 
4 All I can think about watching that is half those places she's likely to get the iPad stolen out of her hands.
4 Every time that commercial plays I almost puke
5 I feel like apple inadvertantly dissed themselves too. "not a computer" is exactly how I'd describe the pile of walled-garden shit they are trying to peddle.
3 So is her backpack also a battery she can charge her ipad with?
9 Is that Deb from Stranger Things?
5 Fucking Christ.Welp, Apple, it was fun while it lasted, you're dead to me now.Jobs was the only thing that made Apple worthwhile and now he's gone.
2 Here I am watching and thinking, "What's the big deal?"Then she finally speaks.
2 I don't think it's a grand idea to let a.. teenager? Kid? Just aimlessly walk around flaunting an expensive piece of tech.  but what do I know, I don't have kids.
2 Oh my god I fucking hate this commercial so muchI really shouldn't even give it a second thought but I get an internal rage when that little shit goes "wHaT's A cOmPuTeR??"
1 I really like it up until that line
1 so trendy
1 And all I wanted to see were the comments on it...
1 ok honestly up until she says that the commercial is fucking great. quite inspiring to what you can do on an ipad. 
1 I just realized I have that exact same hair style... I'm a guy.
1 wow their commercials have gotten even shittier of that's possible 
1 Who the fuck puts their iPad on the counter like that while waiting for food?
1 Damn I can't believe redditors are so triggered by this commercial. It's a joke at the end. Don't feel so personally attacked. Redditors are not the audience for this commercial. Not everything is made for you guys. It's aimed at younger urban families. Not the mostly suburban tech savy community of redditors. The Apple hate on Reddit is so absurd sometimes that a simple commercial causes you all to have a cow. 
1 Watching that made me cringe. I felt an urge to downvote you just because I felt I aught downvote something.
1 As an ad it was decent until the literal last line. Jesus 
1 I seen the first part about a million times on ads before a YouTube video. Made me absolutely hate not only iPads, but that kid too.
1 At least apple has the common sense to disable comments on its youtube videos
1 Apple has never been subtle about their war against General Computing.They don't sell computers, they sell appliances. That's why you don't get to run programs on them, you run whatever the fuck Apple lets you run that day, and you like it.It's so intuitive!
0 Damn. I was cool with this commercial right up to the very end. Epic fail. 
-1 Hey it's that cunty girl from "better things"
9 > That little girl is ~~a liberal's~~ Roy Moore's image of perfection, though.FTFY
1 You're going to get down-voted for days...but let's not kid ourselves, while it could have been said more tactfully, you are right.
4 Did you at least fart into your cupped hand and smell it?
3 I mean, I know *I* would be impressed.
1 Me too thanks.
4 I know but she thinks otherwise.
27 Fucking hell it does.....I....I'm sorry. I think *I* need a drink after that shit.
2 Link?
2 Link?
5 What is "computing"?
2 Ayyyy (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ 
1 Not if they they willingly accepted to say , " What's a computer?"
6 Portlandia-er
2 Her name is Scout and her friend brakes his arm. Which I assumed was a reference to Jem breaking his arm 
8 What's a labtop computer?
5 Or you know, a Surface, or hundreds of other tablet/laptop hybrids that will function in the same niche as an ipad pro while also being more capable. 
3 "Transphobia"Lmao ok buddy
1 Any chance you could help me? That’s my dream
1 Have fun reinstalling from scratch every time Apple releases a new OS X :POnly kidding, I tried to make a Hackbook but my iGPU was too old
0 I bought the 5K base model.It was actually cheaper buying that than a PC by parts with the same specs.
1 [Stop all the downloadin! ](https://youtu.be/RH1ekuvSYzE) 
16 That's fine, but you are talking about the "pc vs apple" debate.  Considering that apple's in this context ARE pcs...You know what, never mind, I was just pointing out their ads are incredibly stupid and based on a flawed premise.
-4 Sell it somewhere else, cause I ain't buying.
15 Ideally, having an external GPU to plug your laptop into at home will be cheaper than building a second computer, and far more convenient. The current barrier is the cost of the adapters, but they’re still cheaper than building an equally capable dedicated gaming pc, with the benefit of convenience. 
3 I dunno... I just got a touchbar Macbook pro (was purchased for me by my company by the way, I have a custom 7700k build) and I would love to plug in a 1080 at home with my laptop and play VR... I can't afford two VR rigs so I have to lug my desktop home when I want to play VR on the weekends...
1 I think an eGPU is an amazing idea. Just have a desktop like setup thats powered by your laptop and egpu. Its a nice idea
1 I can see it be a viable option for someone who moves often or likes to go to friends houses. It wouldn't be portable enough for "gaming on the go" but it's slightly more convenient than lugging around a monitor as well as a tower. But if you don't go to a ton of LAN parties or move residence semi often than it'd be better and cheaper to just get a good desktop and a cheap laptop if you need the portability. 
7 Honestly, sounds like the graphic drivers doesnt work and windows is using a "safe mode" way to function. The way you describe it, thats one of the symptom.
7 There's a difference between budget build and absolutely bottom of the barrel garbage. You could buy a $200 dell and have a better experience than what you just described lol  http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/inspiron-11-3162-laptop/fncwh101hb?cid=310435&st=&gclid=CjwKCAiApJnRBRBlEiwAPTgmxAKQI7rGosh8B4ZUJi3hCwrxxCl5AYk0zTLstMlfae97eI2AaDp1VRoCLAQQAvD_BwE&lid=5860376&VEN1=skayKeuu4,183144151912,901pdb6671,c,,FNCWH101HB&VEN2=,&dgc=st&dgseg=dhs&acd=1230980731501410&VEN3=111004071352167960
1 I wouldn't call that a budget computer. That's a neutered computer.
0 To take the crappiest example you can find and use that n=1 to make sweeping statements isn't really proving a point, you know...
0 What buy a sup-bar spec of a Mac when you can spend the same amount of money and buy a best of a PC?
1 They have supported pci-e many times. They just didn't support nvidias latest chip architecture 
2 How else are they going to convince people to buy new devices?
2 Take a look at React Native. I find that most apps don't use most things hardware other than gps, and it makes shit much more simple.If you are using hardware doe, stick to native.
1 > I've seen many a Mac shatter and crack due to bad build quality.That is complete horseshit. Macs have some of the highest reliability and build quality ratings and have maintained those for the last decade. 
1 In the context of gaming, I can confidently say that it's just not worth it at all to get a Mac.If you're a graphic designer or doing something related to this, I understand that a Mac can actually be favorable in certain ways. And if you're just using a low-end Mac for things like Internet browsing and word processing, then it's understandable.For their high-end laptops, it really just isn't worth it. If you want a Macbook pro with an i7, you're spending at least 2400 USD, and you're only getting 256GB of storage and a mediocre gpu at that price. Honestly the only redeeming quality about there higher-end computers is the iMac because of their displays, and even that comes with some problems. You can get an iMac with a 4k display for $1500, but unfortunately it lacks the processing power to actually run games at this resolution. The monitor is also only 21.5 inches, which is lackluster. The smaller the screen, the less you'll notice a higher resolution, so the 4k selling point isn't that impressive given the size of the display. This is a different story for the 27-inch iMacs since they can come with better graphics hardware, and I'm sure the iMac Pro will perform well since it comes with Vega.But if you're spending all of this money on a high-end Mac and you don't feel at least a *little* ripped off, you're either not paying attention or you don't care.
0 Tens of millions of people don't know what they're doing. That's just truth. Maybe it makes them happy, probably all they care about.10s of millions of people voted for Trump ffs. What kind of argument is that?
-2 Nope.  Go goggle it yourself and re-think you gonna be running a 1080 ti gtx with your Mac on a plane. 
16 >~40 FPS
27 You forgot the fact that they are quite a lot more expensive.
12 You missed the part where most games dobt even make it to Mac OS.Ever gone to the Mac Gaming tab on steam, its hilarious.
10 >A modern Mac can run any modern game in the absolute lowest settings and sill get ~40 fps.Now here's the problem, you're saying this like it's a good thing. A modern gaming PC for the same price will just perform better. You'd be surprised how little you need to spend on a high-end custom PC if you know how to buy parts.
3 Probably pissed off some anti-apple folks, but the main problem is that you can go out and build a PC for 1/3rd of the cost of that mac you just described, with that added functionality that you can pull and replace parts as necessary to extend the lifespan.Apple doesn't let you do shit once you pick your model, so it'd kind of a PITA.That said, this whole argument involves at most 5% of the users on either side.  The next person I meet who purchases a Mac for gaming will be the first.
2 The point is price. You can technically game on a Mac, but it's gonna blow ass compared to a PC costing exactly the same. 
2 > They put more money into the cpu, RAM, and storage.lol let me blow your mind by informing you that apple uses the same intel i5s/i7s, SSD tech and RAM standards that PC manufacturers use. Unless you have proof that apple is getting exclusive technology from the 3rd party companies they source their hardware from. 
7 lol @ "beefy motherboard"lol @ macs having "more money" put in cpu/ram/storagelol @ macs having beefy PSUsonly Mac users can say this shit
9 That isn't the only reason, but it is true. Why optimize games for a dead platform? (gamers are not on macs)
-1 Yeah, it sucks to have an OS that you can both game and work on at the same time.  It sucks to have so many applications.
9 Oh yeah, I used it for a good three years with my first computer. I was using parallels before that but I’m glad I made the switch to boot camp. But while setting that up isn’t super complicated, it takes a bit of effort as well as a windows license. It’s more of a headache than just having a windows PC. Not to mention it requires either an external memory unit to run off of or splitting the partition of your main hard drive. It’s the best option for Apple gamers but not a very good one for gamers in general. The main issue is the GPU power. Apple computers often have good CPUs and RAM but the GPU is neglected. It can run most modern games at the lowest settings at around 40 fps often times and that’s about the extent of it. And with no options for upgrades since it’s integrated, there’s not a lot of draw to Apple for gamers. But you’re right that boot camp is a god send for Apple users. That’s what me and a buddy of mine did. It’s just not enough to get apple enough credibility in the gaming market and that’s mainly what I was addressing. 
3 Different OS, not bios.
3 Just like every other tech product ever from hp, dell, etc. 
2 Oh you're fine. Don't listen to people like that. It is entirely relevant to this post. So is the Xeon the bottle neck or the GPU?
1 I’m not “white knighting” her my dude, it’s just wrong to type stuff like that, ew
4 Bootcamp
2 Hackintosh is a custom built pc made to run OSX, not using the built in boot camp tool to install windows on a partition. (Which was what I was referring to.)
1 Basically he didnt realize she was sitting on the mac. Made a comment about the keyboard lighting
34 based on?
17 I guarantee you your life would be less terrible if you weren't so hateful and bitter.
5 I guarantee you your statement is a wild assumption
140 It’s definitely tougher, with SIP and rootless and Gatekeeper built in, but not impossible. Also many people want/need to disable some or all of those protections, at that point the only advantage you have is that macs are less likely targets since they’re less popular. 
3 Dude... Someone asked me to INSTALL MacKeeper on their computer for them. 
2 No system can protect you from your own stupidity. And no system is 100% immune to malware. That's literally a fantasy. 
2 Never had one in 15 years with no antivirus or firewallMust just be a coincidence 
2 Not trying to be that guy, but if you get a virus on a Mac you're doing some serious shit that you shouldn't be doing. Not saying there aren't viruses for Macs, but out of the 8 years of being a tech with Apple I've never seen a legit infected mac 
1 They can you just have to hold the virus' hand every step of the way. 
1 It might have been true back in the day when Macs were still on PowerPC and not on Intel.i face palmed when a friend -- 10+ years ago -- mentioned specifically clicking on malware links when he believed that Macs couldn't get infected.Explained to him that it was primarily due to the small market share of the Mac at the time and that he could still pick up MS Office macro viruses.
-3 Not so much a misconception, but the sheer fact that I haven't gotten a virus or malware is indicative of the fact that its really really really hard to get one. I go to so many sketchy sites and have never gotten anything. I love it. However, when I boot into Winblows, I have to be careful.
-1 Which is why you see Apple advertisements that say things like "can't get PC viruses".The first time I heard it I thought "There's no way there are people dumb enough to fall for that... No. Wait. I've met people. People are dumb."
4 Browse the Apple Refurbished store.You can get most macs $300 or so off, and they come with the full warranty that a new mac comes from. 
2 Maybe find a well-kept used one? Or find student to get a student discount.
2 Usually back to school sales.  I got mine at Best Buy.  It was on sale for whatever reason, tax free weekend for school supplies (my area specifically), open box and for a while you could get a 10% off Best Buy new movers coupon when you changed your address. Got a Haswell cpu 13" Macbook Air right when it came out in 2013 for just over $800.  Use it a lot every day and it's never skipped a beat.  Even works well for some gaming (Diablo 3, LoL, Darkest Dungeon to name a few).
2 Well, you need a little bit of self control, too. ;)
4 I bought my macbook pro for 800 euros back then and it was so worth it. Battery lasted a full day unlike every other laptop PC for the same budget, great for the university assignments, user friendly linux OS. It's like 8 years old and still works great, only upgraded to SSD.Nowadays if you want a decent macbook (not great, just decent) you probably need 1800 euros...
2 macOS and Linux are both Unix compliant.
2 > predates it by ~~a decent amount of~~ *two* years
1 Wow how perceptive of you. Maybe you should have perceived the fact Linux and Mac are both Unix compliant, thus making them extremely similar.
2 I'm confused as to how you come to that conclusion. I paid around $2200 for my gaming pc and bough a macbook pro for $1800 around a few months apart. They both have their purpose and uses. I use my macbook every day on the couch and also on a dock with an extra monitor. My gaming PC is purely for gaming. It's not like I can carry around my gaming pc everywhere to use in cafes etc... The macbook has an amazing screen, build quality, and it's light with great battery life. People need to understand that people use laptops for work and other purposes and it's not all about gaming.
3 Yeah, Blizzard has always had an extra star in my book since they've "always" made their games available on both pc and mac.
3 A full third of games on Steam work on Mac, and about a quarter work on Linux. Most Blizzard games work on Mac (I think Overwatch was the first release of theirs that wasn't supported on Mac). There's plenty of games out there, but a lot of the big AAA games aren't available on Mac at release (although a fair number are ported over after launch).
1 I didn't buy my last imac (circa 2010) for gaming, but ended up using it for that quite heavily until finally replacing it (for gaming only, still using it for most things) a couple months ago.  I've never had a PC last for 7 years, but the imac is working just fine for 7 and counting.Edit to add: it's amazing how many steam games run just fine on osx.  I did the bootcamp thing for a while but most of the games I play have native mac versions, so why bother?
-4 You could just pirate ports of mount and blade.In fact there were heaps of easy to use and well functioning ports available on pirate bay for games that didn't have an official mac release. Boggles the mind.
-9 Even after Bootcamp, you have a laptop with a mediocre CPU and integrated graphics, so congrats on Hearthstone, Valve games from 13 years ago and PUBG on the lowest settings at -15 fps.
2 I tried it, and it's really cool. Unfortunately, it was too buggy to actually use it reliably, but when it was working it was awesome.
1 Hmmm, how is the latency on that?
1 Yeah, GeForce Now is pretty amazing, especially when hooked via ethernet with a good internet connection, it was hard to tell that the game wasn't running locally. I was able to play the COD WWII beta on my Mac for free during the GFN beta, it was awesome. 
5 Macbook Pro has a 45W CPU. 
4 The base 15" MacBook Pro has [i7-7700HQ](https://ark.intel.com/products/97185/Intel-Core-i7-7700HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz)The GPU could use some help, but it's a Radeon Pro 555 2GB.  It's not great but it gets the job done when you need a quick fix.  
5 WTF does wattage have to do with anything?
1 You're off by about 40w bud
0 It'll help get around Apple's crusty old OpenGL drivers, though. No kidding, I dualbooted Windows 10 on my Macbook Air with an i5-4250U, and OpenGL performance went up by a solid 20-40% under Windows for the same applications. As you say, hard thermal and power limits can't be circumvented, but you can definitely optimize for the budget you have.
-3 And how old are their GPUs again?
1 Can't a normal PC do the exact same thing?  Use osx and windows.... 
17 He's buying a nice gaming rig for gaming. Do you even know the reason why you are spending ~ the same amount on something with weaker specs and less compatibility? 
3 That's definitely a good point of view. But trying to defend gaming on a Mac is just outright misleading the public and I'm not going to support comments about it.
5 No, people who care what platform others play on are losers.You are a loser.
5 I just meant that its less accessible to non tech-savvy people, like you can't just go to the electronics store and buy a linux computer

89 I raged so hard when this came on my shitty hulu commercials. I checked over at /r/apple about what they thought about it and the majority of them really loved it. I'm 26 and it made me feel like a grumpy old man.
47 The thing youll need to know how to use and maintain, especially if Pai kills NN, for sure if you get a job that doesnt require you to stand within 15 feet of a cash register all day. Most people might not need a full on computer, but most people will be paying someone who has one and knows how to get their brick working again because they made the decision to be a tech-tard.Edit: Why would you be holding a device that could literally tell you what a computer is and how it works, but still ask a question so stupid? That kid is a gonner. 
6 Apple is for people who take pride in the fact that they need dumbed down products because a pc is just "too hard to use"Edit: a word
3 "What's a computer?""It's a fully customizable machine built for complex thinking""I draw art""oh.."
1 That thing in your hands dumbass 
1 Gosh.  Barb from Stranger Things was so rude when she was 10.
62 They're fairly clearly going all-in-one/portable as the big selling point in the commercial. I think the sentiment actually works fine until the whole "what's a computer".That is just a really stupid attempt to advertise the idea that home computers aren't going to be relevant in what seems to be a portable technology era.
87 Lol look how quirky us apple consumers are! We pretend a world of technology outside our overpriced products doesnt exist!
1 Basically showing what an iPad is capable of, and the fact that tablets today are powerful enough to replace traditional  PCs. Really I don’t see what’s wrong with it, put into contest this is not all that different from that throw a hammer into pc commercial back in the apple computer days. 
1 They're trying to be the literal replacement for the word "computer".They want us to do that thing where you end up referring to every item as a brand rather than its original reference noun. Crappy example: People might refer to all window cleaner simply as Windex which is a brand name. Apple is just trying to be like "See guys we're hip and cool and have our own thing going on, now please pay us inflated prices for non performance hardware so you can have the privilege to not know the word 'Computer', there is only Apple!" 
1 Seems like it's geared towards my little sister exactly, actually.  Kind of weird actually because she does really cool art, is a huge comic book nerd, can't dress herself,  and takes pictures of weird nature stuff all the time.  I gotta get that kid one of these lol
1 I suspect a new generation of hipster morons. It's not a computer, it's a friend..or some bs.
1 To be fair, what is a computer anymore? Is a phone a computer, is an iPad a computer? That's what they were going for, the reddit circle jerk only looks at the surface and not the real meaning. 
0 Apple has always been about making computers like appliances. No one gives a shit how their refrigerator works, they just want it to work and disappear into the background. That's what they are going for here, and what they have been going for for 30 years.
-146 lol reddit nerds get triggered by anything Apple, jeez.
113 Pretty much. They say kids are so "tech savvy" these days, but once something breaks... well... they just expect them to work... I am constantly trying to teach my kids how routers work, what spyware does, etc etc... I guess it's like how most people treat cars and never put oil in them... they're just machines that get us from A to B, who cares about how combustion works...
19 I think it's more Tim Cook reiterating his "why would you buy a PC anymore" bullshit.Someone has to make the programs people are using on your shit, Tim.
9 yes, at least kids that use iPads
7 And narcissistic 
2 I think that they tried to do a take on how some kids don’t know what a floppy disk, cassette tape, or fax is. But they failed because computers are nothing like those things. They’ll never be obsolete especially not to something like a tablet.
2 Nah but the girl in the recent  iPad pro commercial is a retard.
2 They're not wrong about that though...
-1 It's saying that people who enjoy farting around with computers should go buy PC parts on Newegg while everyone else who just wants to get shit done should get a Mac.
31 she was to busy on her tablet to notice.
1 A ten years old can very possibly grow up without ever use a computer. Her iPad is probably more powerful than a lot of people’s computer anyway. It’s something called advancement in technology. Btw iPad is a computer, just not a computer in the way a lot of people familiar with. Big deal kids are using something different, she might use a surface pro and not a single person will say a word about it. 
24 Being one of the few left with a flip phone, It's incredible how accurate this is. People love their phones, i mean computers, i mean...
5 I mean if I’m out somewhere and attempting to interact with people I always put my phone away. I feel like it’s rude unless you get a text/call right at that moment then you can maybe excuse yourself and respond but if you’re bullshitting on reddit while you’re out with friends talking with them it’s a bit of a dick move imo
5 the internet is genuinely more interesting than random strangers so it shouldn't be that scary for you
2 "Eh! Get that shit off my counter!!"Real world Deli guys don't need clutter on their counter and usually hate kids that flaunt around their phones/pads.
1 It’s not like she’s staring a blank screen... people are actually doing things on their phone. It’s not hard to imagine why people would prefer to do something on their phone rather than “experience the world” on the off chance they get a meaningful interaction. 
11 I can't just have an iPad, it's too small. Also, I don't want to do any picture editing that way.
10 As a person who works IT I can't wait for this day. People are stupid with computers and honestly Apple may not be great for performance with gaming but they know how to provide what the end user needs with the least amount of frustrations along the way. iPads, iPhones and Macs are all a testament to this. Maybe Windows can start focusing on what us enthusiasts want instead of trying to compete with Apple to get everyone to use them. That would be cool to see IMO.
4 The dumbing down of people. Look how easy businesses make it to do things, forget about your choices! We already made those decisions! Now all you have to do is click this button, lowest common denominator!
1 Laptops will never replace a workstation for actual programming, digital art, or 3d development.
1 > jokes aside, I can see this becoming the norm some time with in the next decade. And so can apple. That's why they're pushing the iPad so hard. They're basically trying to move into that space as it grows (like smart company should)"Skate to where the puck is going to be." 
1 Everyone who needs to do serious typing, which is to say everyone, is still going to want a real keyboard.
1 The day a MacBook can play games, or the day an iPad can play Breath of the Wild 60fps 4k is the day I drop my desktop and go straight to tablets and mobile. 
1 I largely agree with you on that.  I would take it a step further though.  In fewer years than more, I think the phone will BE your computer.  Super powerful.  Huge storage on the device, plus cloud.   Place the phone near a monitor and keyboard/input device, it automatically connects and you do your work.  Time to go?  Put it in your pocket and walk away.
3 Apple has been crapping on their own Mac users for almost a decade. They've been pushing a 'post PC' world since around the launch of the iPhone.
28 Do you mean Barb?
1 Rude
1 I know! It's actually a really cute ad until that final part.Then I basically glare at my screen thinking, "listen here you little shit."
1 Damn man, that guy had tendies to provide for.
2 I don't have a gall bladder, so I only fart into toilet bowls.. or I hold it in until I float up into the sky, and then i fart over water sources.
1 Pretty sure I could make you say what's a computer for union scale rates.https://www.sagaftra.org/prod-center/contract/350/rate-sheet/document
1 I, uhh.. have to go to Publix now.
5 Don't you do science experiments in your lap, like me?
1 I would more whole heartedly agree with you if Windows Phone Windows Metro (their Windows 8 Tablet interface) was more successful. If they were doing what they do now 6 years ago, it probably would have been way more successful and had a strong app base.But they remained closed too long so the Tablet interface doesn't have much for apps and developers aren't putting time and effort into them like they are the more popular Android and IOS ones. This does give iOS a certain niche. However, I think they tablets ignore how often you would be in need of a file structure you could easily navigate.That's where full Windows tablets shine, but the desktop apps aren't all designed for touch and very few people use their touch screen on their laptop. I helped someone fix her machine that was a few years old who didn't even know she had a touch screen.
-2 Lmao not a fucking chance. 
4 Ah you sound like my younger self.
11 Unless your computer is a Mac...  I like my MacBook Pro but it cost more than my entire desktop PC which has probably 5x the power at least.
1 That might have been the case. That computer was the absolute biggest pile of garbage I have anyone seen using ever. That's not me sniggering at PC users, my hand to god, that was one serious piece of shit right there. You'd have said the same.It might have been a driver issue, I'm not sure. The hard disk was 10 gigs... man...
2 I have a pc, I like pcs, I like Macs. But for god’s sake man. I used to work at an electronics retailer and this specific laptop was the bane of my existence. Windows 10, WiFi, pretty color, and 10 hours of battery life (Or whatever)! Yeah, all that, and a whopping 32 gig hard drive and 2 gb of ram. To run windows 10. This thing is a heaping pile of shit. Literally buy an amazon fire and you’ll have a better experience. I used to open up like 5 tabs on Edge to show customers that even though they weren’t “gaming or anything crazy like that” the computer was STILL the worst choice out of anything. I would literally direct people to the chromebooks. Sub $200, actually run decently, great for internet browsing and smaller school projects. Anything but that blue demon. 
-1 Thank you for that. That's actually a good argument.Here is the thing though. I'm a Mac driver, have been for many years. I'm extremely experienced working with PCs though. I have used everything between DOS 5.0 and Windows 10. Everything.The argument I heard the most, and which is undoubtedly true, is that 'you can get a much cheaper computer for that money'. There are two things with that though:- you don't get the same experience. You can't. Apple are deep integrators, they build the hardware, the middleware and the software. It works extremely well together. Nobody else can do that because they dictate what the spec has to be to work well with their system. Nobody has that. And that's not because the competition is incompetent. Far from it. But Intel are not OS builders, Microsoft doesn't make the chip, Android doesn't make the chip, Qualcomm doesn't make their own OS. Because they don't there are limits to the experience they can provide to their customer. It's a difference and it's a difference that matters. Having said that: Apple has always charged ludicrous prices for their RAM, you'll never hear me say different.- Second: although PC users, the ones I know and I don't know all of them, obviously, are sometimes manically obsessed with costs, OMG, don't buy a Mac, you'll have to sell your house, your car, your condo and two internal organs!, NOBODY I know, absolutely no-bo-dy, has ever told me they bought the absolute cheapest DELL in the store [the example about the bad PC I mentioned elsewhere was not even a Dell. Even Dell doesn't make a piece of shit like that woman had, it was genuinely that bad.So, cost is not everything in the argument. People also want more than that. Also: try and buy Alienware for a gaming machine, that's also not going to be a cheap machine to buy [the ones I've seen].So, budget is going to speak to a demographic, to be sure. Nobody I know who knows how to work with a computer and who uses a Dell, none of them, buy the cheapest of the cheap, even though they will argue on price./Also: just to be clear, I don't want people only to have the cheapest experience, I very much want you to enjoy your machine, especially if you're going to spend quality time using it.
4 Honestly, that was not what I wanted to say. It just struck me because that really was a bad experience.I use PCs all the time, I'm surrounded by them. I've used them for 20 years [for work]. In my experience they are solid, serviceable and stable if not dreadfully boring, but it's not so, and if it sounded like that, it's not what I meant to convey: that they're bad machines by default [although I'll never love Windows]
7 I use a lot of unix-based tools daily and I'm not sold on the bash shell for windows
3 Because some people use those machines for work. I have a macbook pro because I travel and go to conferences, and I like the battery life for travel, plus the lightness is a bonus. But I do like to game. However, instead of buying a $1500 pc,  I just bought a 1070, and use it as an external GPU with my MacBook.It's cheaper, than a full PC. And it fits my use case. I don't game on the go or at conferences. I work there. But at home when I want to relax, I plug in a few cables, boot into windows, and enjoy my games. 
1 I bought mine for the portability and build quality. I’m also more comfortable using MacOS for professional purposes, since that’s what I use at work.I still have a PC for gaming. But the little MBP is my go-to for everything else.
1 Run a Mac VM on that best PC and you definitely don't have to buy two systems.
3 Right. They are now though. 
4 I make games and media applications. There is no way around native stuff sadly :/ Mac and iOS turned out to be increadible hard to deal with. Lots of traps and zero support (except if you use XCode and do everything the mac way from the start of course ... )
0 Desktops, sure. I haven't had experience with those. The laptops I've seen people break is a different story, anecdotally breaking and burning out more often than non-Macs in my experience. Move from computers to phones/tablets, and it gets worse. Edit: Granted, every tech-savvy friend I've had for the past decade has had PCs and known how to take care of them, while almost every person who's had a Mac has gotten it as their college laptop because they found buying them simple/traditional/familiar and didn't know about computers. Only a few got them for professional purposes. The demographics probably play a role, but the MacBooks I recall didn't last.
1 I don't feel like typing all the words to provide context for that idea. It'll take me too far.
1 And more people voted for Hillary, so people are doubly awful at logically evaluating merits.
3 Already did. Looks like it'll work. Lol on, little buddy. 
6 I was just explaining that there's not a big difference in gaming performance between the high end and low end models of apple products so there's no "buying a mac that could actually run games." They're all equally capable (which is still just barely). I'm not saying mac is a good gaming option, I'm just arguing that there's no such thing as buying a mac that's good enough for gaming in comparison to other macs because the GPU is most often the bottleneck, not the CPU or RAM. And the GPU is basically the same in terms of power between models. 
1 Hey man, I'm still having a ball playing Torchlight on my macbook pro. 
1 I definitely wasn't saying it was a good thing. I was trying to explain that all tiers of mac perform about the same when it comes to gaming because there's not much difference in GPU power. So there's no such thing as buying an expensive enough mac to run games because that's not the issue. No matter how much money you put into buying a mac, you won't get a solid graphics card. I used to own a mac and am speaking from that experience, but I've built a fairly solid gaming rig that I've been using for a good while now. I wasn't defending apples pricing or saying it's a viable gaming option, I just disagreed with the other commentors reasoning. 
1 I was able to play WoWall through college at medium settings on my Mac Pro. Could've played with settings on high if I wanted to, but I liked getting more than 3fps.
2 Oh for sure. Apple will never be a solid option for gaming without a significant change to their focus. I was mainly commenting on the buying a mac expensive enough. They all have pretty similar gaming experiences because they all have comparable GPUs. That's the biggest bottleneck so buying an expensive enough mac isn't the issue. Apple is still overpriced and a bad gaming option, I just disagreed with the reasoning of the other commenter. 
1 I agree they're still overpriced. If you're going to game on PC then building a desktop is by far the best option in both power and cost. I just didn't agree that there's a such thing as buying an expensive enough mac for gaming because the biggest issue macs have isn't addressed in any of the models they offer. The $2500 mac won't game much better than the $1200 mac because the GPU is the problem. I agree with the sentiment, just not the "buy a mac that could actually run games" part. 
1 I’m not saying they put more money into their components than other manufacturers, I’m saying that the difference in price between Apple computer models comes from those components. The difference between a low end Mac and high end Mac is how much money they spend on those components I mentioned and that buying a more expensive Mac doesn’t get you much of an upgrade in terms of the GPU. You’re not blowing my mind. I’m not an Apple fanboy or justifying their outlandish prices. And I’m definitely not saying that Apple is a solid option for pc gaming. I agree with the sentiment of the comment I was replying to, but I disagreed that you can spend enough money on a Mac to get a good gaming experience because the main bottleneck you’ll see on a Mac isn’t fixed by going to a better model. 
-1 Well the motherboard has to be able to handle significant power going to the ports. I'm a windows user that used to own a mac and that's an issue I ran into when I had too many things plugged in. When you have every USB port occupied by devices that use a lot of wattage and bandwidth you run into connection problems. That was because there was a dirt cheap motherboard in it. I know motherboards don't significantly affect things on the performance side of things. But go too cheap and they won't be able to handle significant amounts of external hardware plugged in. And I only mentioned that because an external GPU would be a pretty significant piece of external hardware. And when I said more money, I meant the extra money you spend when you go to a different tiered models *of macs* is mainly put into the CPU and RAM and storage. I was not saying that the extra money you spend for a mac over a PC. And I was not saying that a mac would do well in any of those areas. I was just saying that's the biggest difference between differently priced macs.I've been a windows user for a few years now and am happily gaming with the windows PC I built. This wasn't a post saying macs are powerhouses or that macs are solid option for gaming. This was a post saying that buying an expensive enough mac isn't the issue because *any* tier of mac will have similar gaming experiences. The problem is the importance apple places on GPUs. The GPU is the biggest bottleneck. edit: to understand the issue I'm referring to with apple computers and their motherboards, look up "USB ports drawing too much power" and you'll see loads of people trying to figure out this issue. It's something I've only seen with macs thus far and felt it important to note when discussing something as huge as an external graphics card being used. 
0 I’m not saying that it isn’t a smart business decision to not spend money on optimizing macs, just stating the reason why it costs so much to run games on Mac. Don’t really know why I’m getting so many downvotes :/
2 yeah it sucks to have an OS that has Microsoft spying and isn’t unix based
1 I use Windows for games on my Mac. I use OSX for actual work. Can't do that on your winblows machine. You are stuck in Windows permanently. 
-5 No, both usually are different. Mac is usually UEFI while PC is BIOS.
1 The Xeon's are pretty powerful.  They are a slight bottleneck as you can see in the start of the gameplay at 98% but once the map is fully loaded it hovers around 50%.  The real bottleneck is the motherboard's bus speed.  Also Windows only recognizes the PCIE 2.0 as PCIE 1.1.  The GTX 1060 should get a constant 75 fps in SWBF2 on a 7700k PC.  In a CPU intensive game like SWBF2 I avg around 45fps.  Less CPU intensive games like Rocket League will run at 100+fps.
34 This loser has nearly 600 posts in MTGOW, clearly he's an expert on women. /s
40 Girls are dumb fellow gentlesir \/s
4 and an asshole dont forget to tell him not to be an asshole
4 Mmmm roast pork ramen
170 Also the vast majority of businesses use Windows for most of their machines, and hacking into some company's computer systems is probably a lot more lucrative than stealing some art major's info. 
9 Nothing is secure like a Mac, provided that none of your attackers bother to type 'root' and hit enter twice!
8 i thought the main reason they didnt get viruses was because they were less popular
1 The whole "type root hit enter three times" backdoor issue seems like it's pretty insecure these days though. 
1 I'd actually say there are a fair bit of viruses that target Macs.
1 Completely unrelated, but I went on the Gatekeeper at cedar point this year and it was a 10/10 ride for someone who had only ridden 1 coaster prior to it.
1 I think 90% of the reason is due to the popularity thing. 
11 >the sheer fact that IStopped reading there
2 They quietly stopped advertising this once it was no longer true.  But it was true at one point, macs were too uncommon over a decade ago to bother.
2 Hahaha, I never really get in trouble, but it's more of a 'that trick doesn't work for me'
2 It wasn't meant as a general statement but a very niche one. I don't really care much for mobility, my phone suffices for that. For everything else I have a PC and I can't think of a single thing that it does that a mac would do better enough to justify the price.Also PCs are modular so I can spend as much as my wallet dictates and still have a pretty beefy rig. All of this considering that my gaming rig is half of what you spent on yoursAs for OS, a lot of it comes down to personal preference. I used a mac for about a year for a job developing apps and I can genuinely say that I hated every minute of it. The only positive about it is the *nix aspect
1 Yeah personally I wouldn't compare my gaming PC to a portable anything
1 As a former MacBook Pro owner, I hate this statistic (and have been accused of all sorts in the past).One third could very well be the least popular third, which actually isn't that good. 
1 The steam version included both for Mount and Blade. When I was heavy on gaming I just kept the windows running. I usually played Minecraft on Mac on deployment. COD was a windows only at the time. I had a few ports, I think I got Portal for free on Mac which was awesome.
3 I play Arma 3 on my 4 year old retina 15inch at the default framerate.
4 Lol why do you even care so much? Let people do whatever they want.  
2 You must have not been paying attention to Apple in the last year. https://support.apple.com/kb/SP760?locale=en_US
2 I only tried it briefly on one or two games and it was alright, but i was mostly looking for frame rate and performance improvements.  There are probably some benchmarks out there to find.  It isn't super amazing right now, but i can see it being pretty strong as they improve it.
2 Surprisingly low. You can tell that it's there, but the games are definitely playable.
1 I've found it to be very, very low, even on a 2012 MBP and on wifi. It's the solution Mac users needed. 
1 Sweet.  I've been meaning to try it out against some point.
1 Power and thermal budget. A ultra low power CPU with a 5 watt thermal design power and integrated graphics chip is going to be clocked low with very conservative power usage characteristics, by design. 15 to 25 watts is more common in laptops, with 45 watts being a ceiling for portable workstation-class chips. On the desktop those numbers are substantially higher on average.
1 Computation uses power.  A CPU that uses 1/18th the power of another CPU of the same architecture won't even perform in the same ballpark.  
4 Not natively.
0 Yes. In fact, some people even build desktops designed to run macOS as smoothly as possible. These machines are often called Hackintoshes. You can learn more at /r/hackintoshEdit: What are you people downvoting me for!? I answered the question.  
4 I mean, word in the street is that stability and reliability are things that are important to some people. I have a client that switched his shop from running windows pc's to using Macs and he hasn't really had many complaints ever since while he suffered some pretty significant downtime on his previous setup.
3 Maybe becuase he ALSO does things other than gaming, and needs the OS? 
-1 If that is the case, then why all the hate on people who game on macs? They are fairly capable machines. I can play Overwatch on my 2015 Air at a reasonable FPS on low settings. The comment I first replied to said that people who use macs are idiots. Even then, there’s so much hate around them anyway from the mouthbreathers spewing shit about “hur just build ur own”. I like my Mac. It’s tiny. It’s a hell of a lot more portable than a mid-tower PC.That, and it runs OSX natively. I don’t have to fumble around with building a hackintosh. OS X’s user interface is great imo
1 Actually you can. Some companies start to sell them. I totally understand why you’re saying though, I just think it’s time to let go of Windows.Developers and users are the two major factors in the use of an OS and they highly depend of each other. If one makes the change, so does the other. The users will not make the change because they’re used to windows and nothing bothers them, and devs will not make the change because of profits. Someone needs to break that loop, I wish I knew how
73 Every time. EVERY TIME i see this commercial i say this.
6 > HOMUNCULUSWhoa there. Calm down ex-Rioter Sanjuro.
1 We need an extended version of the commercial where the nice old lady, who's just showing interest in this hipster kid, freaks out and calls her an INSOLENT LITTLE HOMUNCULUS! 
-35 'Memba whence Hillary Clinton wiped her computers so the FBI couldn't find her passing classified US intel to non-cleared people?I 'memba.
40 Stop all the downloading!
2 *who wants a body massage?*
55 They're called sheep for a reason
2 'Whats a computer?''It's what you're using, you little brat.'
1 I like it till she said “what’s a computer”, but not just that she said it, but that she said it like she was being smart, like she knows what a computer is but is trying to be funny or something. 
0 I'll just say that it's so worth the small price to not have commercials, just for the mental health and time saved.
0 I loved it. Apple is taking another risk pushing what they believe is the future of computers - powerful and highly interpreted portable computers, also known as tablet. Just because you don’t like iOS compared to windows, or she doesn’t play as graphically intense games as some people doesn’t make it less a device, or a bad product move. Tablet can very well replace all traditional desktops when size is no longer a issue. Look at surface pro, slap into a docking station it’s more powerful than my actual computer.  
61 I think you are thinking about this too much, its a stupid commercial that makes apple look even more out of touch with reality than they already are, thats about it. 
7 Chill dawg, your putting too much thought into it 
1 Yo dawg my cash register is a computer
1 That kid is a gonner? An actor giving lines is a gonner?
0 Whooosh. 
-5 The point of the commercial is that iPads can "replace" a computer because they can do everything a desktop or a laptop can do, not that she literally doesn't know what a computer is. Obviously that's a ridiculous claim, but everyone seems to be missing the point lol
0 Shows your average Apple user really.
4 OR, you know, for people who work with 10 GB images and don't want winapi to crash every 20 minutes.
2 I posted these photos to my wall!I unfriend you!
2 I never understood this. Macs don't seem any easier to use than PCs. In fact the UI is a bit confusing and with all the restrictions it makes some things feel clunky.iPhones vs. Androids on the other hand? iPhones are by far more user-friendly.
40 I'm sure that Ipad will quickly whip up a full detail render in solidworks in about 5 weeks.  
4 We've had an iPad for years and rarely if ever used it. Tablets man.. I dnno, it feels like it's not good enough for a PC but not portable/handy enough for a phone. One of the most useless gadgets out there for me.
3 I interpreted it more as a "as long as it works fine and integrates seamlessly into your life, you don't even have to think about what makes it work".
1 It also is trying to differentiate between smallish computers without keyboards and hinges and largish computers with those things, because apparently computers are for dorks or old people or something. "Laptop" would have been a better term, seeing as they're trying to emphasize the freedom of the ipad and how it makes you young or something.
1 Yea, I remember alot of the philosophy behind Windows 8 was this. It was a fucking terrible idea.Computers arent going anywhere
47 This little girl/boy/lunchlady is running around a metro with no supervision at like, 10 years old, waving around $1000 while she sits alone in the shade, in an unpolished* park alleyway, focused on drawing. If it were anything but a commercial that little xir would be getting hit by reality so hard xer hair would uncurl.* un*policed* - but I'm keeping it.
7 Ugh I will get downvoted, but I am going to go in another direction with this. I think this whole Apple vs Microsoft debate all comes from the Microsoft side these days. It is borderline shit lording and just aimless whining about a issue no one really cares about. So there is competition for the Microsoft platform to keep them from becoming a monopoly? O no, sound the alarm. I personally have a Gaming computer, Gaming laptop, playstation 4, nintendo switch and 12.9 inch ipad, I actually find myself using the ipad more on a daily basis. It's just fast, convenient, portable and the UI just simply works.For gods sake we don't need a GTX 1080 card to watch netflix, shop amazon or facebook stalk our exes... 
-3 the "Apple products are overpriced" thing is such a tired, lazy argument. What you get is super comparable price-wise to offerings from other companies.
73 Sorry but what's a reddit?
4 The irony here is palpable. 
44 Studies have shown that while computer usage is nearly universal, computer literacy is stagnant or worse than it was 30 years ago. This is much like the situation with cars where in the 50's/60's every man knew how to do some auto-mechanic work, but today changing a tire is a stretch for many.
43 Hold up for a second though. First off, agreements. Yes, children feel they are "tech savvy" because they know how to go into settings and connect to wifi. They don't understand the how, why, or what is actually making them connected to the internet. However, I'll be damned if my child is going to touch my $2500 gaming PC because I know they don't know what they're doing. Let them have the iPad, if they fuck that up from the inside then they have worse issues than not knowing what a PC is.
9 I had to explain to my nephew why I couldn't just plug in the Gameboy color he left on all night.  That to make it work again I would have to go somewhere to buy new batteries for it. 
12 Kids are tech savvy compared to their grandparents. And the people googling things on the other end of the support line are tech savvy compared to the kids. And we're tech savvy compared to them.It's all subjective.

-5 Apple computers are meant to die in 3 years. PCs suppose to last 10 years+
22 Whats a tablet?
26 Computers?  What's a computer?
1 I had a flip phone for about half a year before getting a smartphone and trust me, do yourself a favour and get yourself luxuries like reading email on the go.
1 > Being one of the few left with a flip phoneOh, hey, me too. I carry a laptop with me everywhere though. A smartphone wouldn't be as heavy...
6 Yeah I'm the same really. Even my Dad takes his phone out when I'm talking to him all the time and it's clear he's completely not listening to me anymore and just replies with "uh huh. eh? eh." until I give up -.-
1 most people dont care if its too small, plus I said that, people will still have desktops for creating content including but not limited to photoediting. 
0 Then don't
5 That's all fine and dandy, until you actually want to create something for an iPhone or iPad. I'm a web developer and had to fix some issues on an iPad app we developed, and by god the required software (XCode) and the whole publication process made me want to slash my face with a rusty rake.  Not to mention having to work on a Mac (because obviously developing for Mac requires a Mac, because everything needs to be vendor-locked in - unlike pretty much every other web tech or framework). It just works? Nah, let's make everything as hamfisted and illogical as possible. I admit I'm a PC user by nature, and the opposite is probably true for Mac users having to work on a PC, but fuck I hate struggling with, as opposed to working with my software, and as a result I'm at best half as productive compared to working on my "native" OS.  &nbsp;  When it works it's great stuff, and unlike most brands, Apple hardware still manages to tickle my aesthetic fancy bigly, but I'd rather do two hours of unpaid over-time on my own laptop than 1 paid working hour on a Mac.
9 This is true, however, as a fellow IT guy, I fucking hate walking into a room and seeing a macbook I'm expected to work on. Fuck those things, they're so unintuitive (for someone used to using windows). Any task will take me twice as long on a macbook as on a pc. I'm sure they're great for people who don't know what they're doing and just want to take it to the apple store every time they have a problem, but I hate them with a passion. That said, I have to admit that I do like the overall UI design. It's pretty slick.
2 my experience has been that most people operate fine regardless of the system they have so long as its setup for them. the problem that comes into play is when things stop working then its a mess. apple sucks ass for this as they tend to have limited means of fixing thing. Granted they are a bit better at the user end experience thing as they tend to keep shit about as simple as it can get but this isnt always perfect. the best example of personal computing with no mess, easy as fuck user end experience are video game consoles. they're super locked down, limited settings, limited apps and do what they're advertised for. I think we'll eventually end up seeing more things like game console like system in the future, at least built into TV's and home systems like a centralized computer for the home thats connected to all displays within the home. 
1 You do not support apple where you work eh?
2 thats what most people want. most people HATE dick'n around with their electronics in unintuitive ways. its why everyone wants the "short amount of clicks" solutions. its why android home screens are FULL of icons and widgets and shit. Personally I dont mind going into a menu to pull up and app and locate the info I want, its not a big deal, takes like 2 seconds tops. for most people just they want what they're looking for the moment they want it and not a second longer and they dont care how they get it.         most people dont know the other side of the hill, they only know systems as they're presented, not as they could be. You and I think to our selves "man, wish my phone could do X and Y, I'll look it up and see if there is a way I can do this" (or if you know how, you just write the program your self). Every one else just thinks "wish my phone could do X and Y, maybe apple will add it some day" and thats the end, they go back to baking or working on their car or playing with their dog.. they dont put any more thought into becuase they dont care enough.  
1 maybe.. probably. we'll find out I guess but if the computing power is there and your tools are all the same what does it matter? if you need multiple screens then fine im sure whatever system is in place in the future will accommodate that fine.     if everything you needed could be contained in a notebook sized peice of a equipment, wouldn't you rather that have the potential to be portable?    the only reason I can think that workstations will never go is their ease of repairability. should something break down its easy to replace parts on a workstation and go back to work, but I only see this being the case in home or small business. larger business will just have thin clients that can be easily swapped out.. hell most already do this anyway.
8 Nothing plays BotW at 60fps or 4k.

1 i was playing overwatch on my macbook pro before I built a PC. Yea I got 30fps but hey it ran

3 I don't really see that happening. IOS has been out for a decade and it still doesn't have a real file manager.
1 That's what the ubuntu phone was supposed to be…
1 I finally decided to drop OSX from my Hackintosh because Apple refuses to support HDMI 2.0. I'm going to miss a lot of things, but fuck I'm sick of the shit Apple has been doing to OSX and their desktops. At this point they might as well say fuck it and stop making computers entirely.

1 That's true but with Windows 10 the conversion between tablet and laptop makes a lot more sense. I honestly don't know why more developers don't write Windows Touch apps considering how big of a market it will be with the shift towards all windows laptops having touch built in. 
2 It might be closer than you think, assuming you buy another 5K monitor of equal quality. Probably depends on the specific iMac too, the bang-for-buck ratio varies depending on the model.Although if you buy them separately, you get to keep the monitor beyond the life of the computer. Can’t do that with the Mac.
1 Lmao, do the math then...
1 Dude, everything you said sounded like an Apple Ad.  I've used macs, I've used PCs, and my overwhelming experience is that Macs are selling you a narrow band of technology that works fine at what it does, but doesn't do all that much.I certainly have no patience for people trying to convince me they are somehow special and not just a particularly shitty brand of PC.
0 But at least it looks pretty amirite?
3 It was certainly the case. Higher resolutions are supported since DOS 3.
1 Haha yeah, not saying it's great, but it's better than the one the guy above was referencing lol
4 Apple doesn't build their hardware, however the "deep integration" you talk about is definitely true. By controlling exactly what hardware is running their OS (with the expection of hackintosh), and what software is available to users, Apple enforces much stricter control over the end user experience. Which is not bad for the people who are after what they offer. However, for the parts (which remember, apple doesn't manufacture themselves) Apple computers are overpriced. You pay a premium for the type of tight end user experience Apple wants to present you with. Now, is it an INSANE amount of money? No. But it is significantly more than you'd pay for a comparable pc. To address the Alienware comment, they are similarly overpriced, and I personally wouldn't recommend one to someone looking for a gaming machine. Finally, I would mention that I work with computers, and while I would never use a $200 dell for a daily driver, they definitely have their uses. For a laptop like that my first step would be to install a light touch linux distro. You'd get better performance than running windows, and it would likely become a competent browser machine. I have a cheapo acer mini netbook at home that I use as a personal server. The point is that per $ you get far more versatility and performance on buying a pc.
1 With a PC, I can do a build after components have been on the market for awhile, read reviews, find out what is reliable, and put together a machine that will last 5+ years, perform incredibly well, be incrementally upgradable, and come in cheaper than a machine from Apple.I dropped ~$1k on my last serious PC build, since then it gets an SSD upgrade whenever SSD prices collapse, and a mid level video card every 2 or 3 generations. (No big surprise, the 16GB of RAM I put in there to begin with has been plenty for the last half a decade).Maybe one of these days I'll get around to replacing the Motherboard.Because I was able to pick and choose the parts, and I wasn't going for the newest stuff on the shelf, I was able to buy incredibly reliable components. With Apple, sometimes their hardware works, sometimes it doesn't. From frayed power cables, deglazing laptop screens, to display driver glitches (snow on external monitors is ~~fun~~ wtf).I'll admit that when Apple works, it works really well. But you are at the mercy of the company that makes it work, want a new GPU? Only when Apple approves, and only for the types Apple approves.I'll admit most of Apple's reliability problems have been one offs with various models of laptops, their desktops are reliable, just... out of date for the price. And of course limited on form factor. I rocked an mitx case with a dedicated (low power) GPU as workstation box for awhile, just because I could. Also because it was a solid cube of brushed aluminum and I loved confusing the heck out of the designers who wondered why a developer had a shinier box than they did. :-DApple does do great driver work. Drivers take a long time to get right, companies that have many SKUs and who put different components (WiFi chip, BT chip, etc) in each SKU are never going to have the same level of quality. It can take a year+ for a development team to get experienced with a piece of hardware and get it fully working w/o any bug or other issues. (Excessive power consumption is common, getting low power modes working is *hard*) This is why companies like Apple and Microsoft use the same chipsets in their parts year after year, even if the WiFi chip isn't the greatest, it can still perform better (or at least more reliably)  than the new hotness a competitor is using after only having had their hands on it for a few months. 
2 Fair enough: it came across a bit as such (at least to me), but that's on my behalf then. And to be honest, I've had the pleasure of having to work on similar Windows-driven train wrecks a few times - no fun, at all!  I'm on the opposite side of the fence: Windows-user through and through (for more than 20 years), and having to work on a Mac at times makes me want to pull my hair out. But that's doesn't make them bad in my book (there's a lot of things about Apple I can appreciate) - in the end it's just a matter of what you're used to and most comfortable with.
1 You don't have to install windows on the PC :P
0 True that. I've done that so I can troubleshoot issue before.
1 And people built their new computers in those months never considered Apple because they didn't have support in a reasonable time. 
1 Media is actually really easy! Both iOS and android have bin c++/c/makefile support, so its not hard to have one source code for audio/video and then build for both. Spotify, iirc, does that exact build config. All their binaries for music are built from one source and the only thing native in their system are the views.Custom view manipulation is a frigging bitch on native, on both platforms (although android is a little easier). Are you switching from unity or html/js games? I know a few mobile game devs who would love to give advice.edit: you are so right about the 0 support, I'm learning mac desktop stuff and their api docs are a nightmare.
1 Exactly, and after they were told their votes don't count and Trump wins because of a rigged system they keep believing and repeating the lie that voting matters. Voting for president is pointless, the only important issues worth voting for are the ones where your vote is actually counted as a tally.
-1 How are you going to power the 400 watt PSU lol. Also, they are the size of a minitx PC and the fan get pretty damn loud on load.  There's no way you gonna be running that setup on a plane.  I am guessing you never seen someone used it IRL have you?
7 No I understand, I was answering your edit question as to why people were downvoting you.

2 Oh ok that makes sense. I found a xeon PC at work and am wondering how well it would make for a back up PC project. Its a Dell, and I don't know the specs but I worry the MB will be the limiting factor, should still be fun though.
8 do I even want to know what MTGOW is?
-31 There are more girls in corporate ads playing video games than there are girls who actually play video games.
1 Its just the best m i rite
84 I think it's the impenetrable layer of stickers that makes an art major's laptop secure
21 There are more than just art majors using a Mac.  [In fact, the MacOS has extended its lead as one of the most popular platforms for developers.](https://www.geekwire.com/2016/mac-overtakes-linux-as-developers-primary-os-windows-headed-below-50-market-share/)  
3 Basically every company *except the most profitable company in the world*
1 This is a solid point, but to counter, a vast majority of distribution companies in film/television use Mac systems- and these are the companies you would want to hack in order to get unreleased Game of Thrones or whatever.
1 A lot of tech companies use Macs though - the last two I have worked at were over 95% Mac. They make good laptops, and it's Unixy which has its pros. Also if your software needs to support Macs or iOS you have no choice.Non-developer companies I've worked at used Windows though. And IE. Ugh.
3 Or ask for the password hint
8 Macs are becoming more and more popular. So that's not really a thing anymore. In some ways, the OS is safer - most mac apps are fully sandboxed, for example, but only if they come from the mac app store. Another security feature is that every app needs a certificate from apple to run. **this setting can be disabled** but requires you to enter your password to flip the switch, protecting you from malware that would try to do it. but buy default, it keeps most non-authorized software from running. 
2 No man. Mac OS 9 was far less popular than windows and OSX is right now and it had tons of viruses.
1 This was true like 10 years ago. But since the Iphone is now super popular any way to get into someone's cloud is desirable.
1 Yea there's less people using them overall and way less commercial use of them so creating scripts meant to hack into Macs is a waste of time for people unless they have a really specific reason/target in mind. Hell lots of mac owners still own some kind of Windows machine but not the other way around so there's always going to be a large majority of windows users for things like botnets
1 That is the main reason.
1 Macs by nature have a more restrictive system.It's both a blessing and a curse.Completely depends on what you want to do.
1 I recently saw it in a tv ad from... whenever the last episodes of Grimm were airing. (Had it on DVR and *finally* got around to finishing it.)
-2 I care, because there leaving out the fact that Apple + whatever solution they have only lets you play non-AAA games. They're making it sound like you can play any game on Apple, when in reality you can only really play integrated-graphics games.
0 What does it cost $4,000. I got a gtx-1080 for like 450 and a 4k hdr monitor for 260, plus I have everything else, including a i7-4790 from a while back adding up to 1200 round-trip for a top-tier gaming pc. What does apple's radeon 580 build cost, keeping in mind that a 580 gets beat out by a 1070.
1 Thermal/power load doesn't have shit to do with anything.  I could find chips from 10 years ago with wattage through the roof and were slow as dogshit by todays standards.  Clock speed, cores, etc. is what you need to look at, not fucking wattage for fuck's sake.
0 That's what I though.  I honestly have no interest in an osx machine as I am 98% gaming.  I just don't get why people pay so much for these machines. I mean my PC is very very expensive but if it was a mac I'm sure it would have had a $1000 tax added to it. 
0 Just stop caring what they think because they sure as shit don't care what you think. The best way to annoy tribal retards is to not give a shit. Let them scream at you for spending your own money and enjoying what you bought. They can't stand it and that's why they're all over the internet squealing about it.

1 Nobody's questioning what their motives were. They're questioning how they went about it. The commercial is infinitely dumb. I get the concept behind it. But the execution was piss poor
12 and to think that when the 00's rolled around they were pretty ahead of their competition as far as OS's go. they squandered it. the iphone killed apple as a computer company. now they're trying to find their lost mojo. 
1 This screams "made by boomers" so hard.
1 It's irritating seeing *just how hard their trying* to convince us how happy healthy people use i-pads all the time and that they're the be-all and end-all of everyday convenience. It's embarrassing seeing someone's agenda so clearly. It's like seeing someone with an obvious erection.I suppose that applies to most ads though. I used to listen to the radio all the time and it wouldn't bother me, but now I can't listen without having to turn it off during the adbreak. There's something depressing hearing a dozen people *desperately* trying to win me over.
0 It's shows they thrive off perpetuating their consumers ignorance on technology. 
13 iPads are computers
1 The neighbor didn't ask her what she was doing with her desktop/laptop though.
2 The people you describe are far lesser than "proud to be dumb" people
2 I guess its a person by person thing... i've used both throughout my life, and have always found Mac OS to be far more intuitive. Both have their pro's and con's... I much prefer the customizability of a PC, but for actually working on, Mac OS feels a lot more natural and efficient to use, for me.
1 Give a Grandma a Mac and an PC, and go cry when she ask what Program Compatibility Troubleshooter is
2 tbf I'm not so sure non-engineers are doing extremely complex things in CAD. 
1 Not possible.  It will have to spend at least 3 hour updating itself in that time period.
2 They're great for browsing... images... on the internet... alone at home. 
1 Best use for tablet is as a smart remote/app streamer for your smart tv, and also as a kid distractor.Also good for doodling and web browsing.Not designed to replace laptop or phone imo, though I do love the battery life compared to a laptop and portability for room to room media.I can be cooking and watching something on tablet, move to living room and stream it to my tv, etc.Now whats really useless are tablet laptops, a whole lotta useless touchscreen features on a laptop and easy to break flippable screens.
1 I use mine 95% of the time for one purpose.  To play Hearthstone... against my wife... on her ipad.
1 Which is still a terrible sentiment, really.
1 Seems like if apple make cars, they want them to change tires only at apple stores.
2 Doesn't everyone with a cell phone wave around $500 whenever they send a text?
-2 You sound really bitter. 
1 I saw an overweight guy with a ponytail crossing the street pulling his gigantic gaming tower in a red wagon once. To each their own. I personally don't see the huge deal with a hipster tween girl carrying her iPad throughout a day talking to friends and working on homework. I agree with you entirely. The whole "fuck apple" argument is childish. Gamers will buy their red glowing rigs, architects will buy their tablet/computer hybrids, graphic designers will buy their macbooks, hipster school girls will buy their homework iPads, etc.... 
1 The other commercial Apple is currently running includes the line, "I can't do that on my PC." It's not all one sided.
5 This is news to me, last I checked apple computers and phones have midrange (at best) hardware compared to similarly priced alternatives.

1 I don't care how much a person knows about computers, they're not touching my computer.  The moment someone puts their fingers on the keyboard, something gets fucked up.  
1 Granted when you were a kid you may have made that mistake once. I know I did because of that I never made that mistake again.
1 The term "knows computers" means something wildly different today than it did 25 years ago. Today, it means you know how to **use** a computer fairly well, but back then it meant you knew **how they worked**.
2 She left it *face down* on hardwood floor in the opening shot.
5 Eeeeeh.I manage about 100 Macs that are anywhere between 2010 to 2017 in vintage at this point. Some of the older ones are having issues, but most are chugging away without a problem.
2 Source? I've had my MacBook Pro for about 6 years now, zero issues.
2 I don't understand where this idea comes from. I've had both pc and Mac for years. Had two PC's that lasted for more than five and one that only lasted two. I've had three macs and all of them lasted longer than 5 years. Two of them lasted close to ten years. My aunt had one of those ancient bulbous macs that people do DIY projects with now and hers lasted close to 15.They really don't break down that easy and are simple to fix. Heck, if you have one apple will give you free tech support over the phone that's actually damn decent. Most of the time it will just take a call in if you don't have the know how to test in safe mode or do an NVRAM reset etc. Worse case a fresh install fixes most everything except dropping the thing. 
0 When you build the thing yourself and know how to navigate the software you can fix things relatively simple compared to Apple. A computer is a computer but I agree Apple purposely implements planned obsolescence. 
0 Both Mac and PCs last 10 years plus if you take care of them and built them to last. I had a pentium 3 computer I built for college programming classes in 99 last me till 2011 as the home server. Everything needs maintenance. 
1 A giant smart phone.
3 "Computer"... hmmm.... nope never heard of it
3 As an IT professional, people care dearly if things are too small. Old people can't see shit.Fights have been started over 17" laptops and availability to 2/4 monitor setups.
2 Well it’s clear it’s just because that is what you’re used to and nothing to do with MacOS. If you get so comfortable with a system then of course the other is going to be awkward even if it isn’t any worse it is just different.
1 > but fuck( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
6 I've had the fortune to work fairly extensively with both. Windows is far superior to mac from a networking/business use perspective. I'm not a system admin but the one I work with won't switch to Mac solely because it doesn't have the options Windows has. That being said I think they're both just as pain in the ass to work with its just a matter of learning both systems. For the most part getting a task accomplished on a mac will take the same amount of time it would take me on a pc. Its just a different method of doing so. I grew up on Windows 98-Xp then used OS X 10.6-10.11. Also when Mac switched from Mavericks to Yosemite I built a gaming PC running Windows 7 because I thought the new Mac OS feel and style felt too mobile in comparison to older versions of the OS. Now at work we are upgrading all of our software to Windows 10 (staring with IT) and after using that I'm enjoying Windows 10 the most I would say. I also work in IT though so when my girlfriends sister asks me what she should buy for a computer I tell her an iPad because I don't want to get phone calls saying shes worried because windows firewall told her that a file could be harmful to her pc. Its one of those things where I can see the value, just not for me.Sorry for the book. :)
2 Maybe it’s because I’ve been using Mac for about 8 years now, but I’m about three times faster on a Mac vs Windows.  Between its file management system, Automator, and terminal; I feel like I’m more in control of what I’m doing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not in anyway trying to say Windows is inferior or something...that would be asinine. Just that if you spend enough time with the OS, you’ll see that Apple made something that’s so much more than just an operating system for novices. 
1 As a ~20 year Windows user I recently switched to a Macbook for work related stuff (webdesign).I don't really hate Mac, but I do feel a bit restrained sometimes. * I think the docking bar thingy is very unintuitive. Often times I have stuff open which I havent spotted for hours and all it does it drain my battery faster.* Fullscreen windows hiding my docking bar is something I hate with passion* People say the Finder is better then Microsoft's file explorer, but I feel contained. I used a program that allowed tabs in file explorer and it worked wonders. Often times I'm struggling to navigatie (especially back up the folder chain) with Finder.* That said, MacOS has a much prettier design. Both in their UI aswel as their hardware.* Most progress bars, load up screens etc. are much more modern. On a PC you're still looking at Dos POST screens and pixelated Windows logo's. MacOS loading bars are very satisfying to watch.* They are much closer to the phone-app approach in terms of installing programs. I like how it's all pretty seamless.* Their Macbook is expensive as fuck, but damn that trackpad is godly (on the flipside, using an external mouse is fucking hell trying to stop mouse acceleration). Also the 6-8h battery is incredible, as well as of course the Retina display.All in all there isn't much real difference. The programs I use are pretty similar, and having your browser open looks virtually identical anyway.I do miss Windows sometimes, but maybe it's because I was so accustomed to it. 
1 True but what about doing simple things like word processing. Can't do that on a PS4 as far as I know and if you can I'll bet it'll be a pain in the ass. I would argue that the reason you think Apple is a pain in the ass when things go wrong is because of your lack of experience with them. They both are fairly easy to fix most of the time granted you have the knowledge to do so. 
1 We do. I work for a printing company and our pre-press department uses Macs. Their job is basically to spot check work and make sure that the plates are ready for the presses. So in total I work with about 10 Macs at work in comparison to a few hundred PCs. Just by the laws of average you would expect I see a higher number of issues with PCs which is to be expected but I've been here for close to a year and I've only had to deal with a Mac problem once and it wasn't even due to a Mac error. It was a networking issue where our maintenance department accidentally put the Macs on our presses network which doesn't allow access to the rest of our network. That's what happens when maintenance stars messing with ethernet cables though.
1 This is how I feel about it. My perception is that many people are just accepting the options presented to them instead of looking for alternatives. 
3 We're pretty close though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMRuDTP3qscIf the emulator gets some more optimization improvements and/or we get a CPU with stronger single core power Botw at 4k60fps will be a reality.
1 Exactly. When something can, that’s when I draw the line. My 1070 and 8700k has trouble emulating it at 40 FPS in some areas. 
1 That’s not terrible. Boot camp or parallels? Or does overwatch run on Mac?
1 Holy shit really? Haven't touched ios since 2010 
1 it actually JUST got a file manager with iOS 11    it was kinda on the downlow though with its release and im pretty sure its more of a file viewer than a full manager/browser. something like the "my files" part of finder. 
1 Besides the file management, is there another reason you disagree with this? Honestly I think it's a really nice almost brilliant idea. My android phones don't really have a good file management but there are apps that do it just fine. So it's not a huge leap to have that integrated i assume. Unless you mean some other file manager I'm not aware of. I'm tech literate enough for my own purposes but not as much as others. Also, personally I wouldn't look to Apple for this kind of thing, they don't seem to be the useful innovative types anymore. I could be totally wrong, just wondering if there's more than file management.
1 Too confusing for the user.

2 Because people don't use touch on their laptops. It's a gimmick that computer companies throw on for the buzz word but they do a shotty job making it.
4 Exactly.The cheapest 5K monitor you can buy right now costs $1299The chapeaste 5K iMac (the one I bought) costs $1799.$500 was/is not enough to buy that CPU, GPU, then the motherboard, case, PSU, RAM, keyboard, mouse, and OS license.
2 How in the hell does a Mac not do all that much? It is absolutely the best equipment for web devs, graphic design, and music/movie editing amongst other things.Care to elaborate?
1 Yay I am succeeding at my internet marketing campaign!I'm just telling my experiences. They make some solid devices if you aren't biased. They work great for what most people use them for, unless you do something specific that requires Windows or Linux. The OS isn't my favorite but the hardware is pretty damn good quality and that's what I care about. I dropped my Dell once and it died, my MacBooks survived all kinds of shit and were a breeze to upgrade RAM and HDDs. And like I said, Bootcamp runs Windows just perfectly. They are expensive as hell, but I didn't have to buy a new one for a long time. Annnnnnnnd, some manufacturers have caught up to them in terms of build quality, HP even came pretty close. 
1 Unless the display panel was 800x600 max
0 Good, solid argument. I appreciate it.I'm going to give you the price argument right away, it would be stupid to argue different.Integration-wise though, I've been spoiled. I'm working with great hardware that works very well with its environment. My system is stable and solid. It's true that it's very much a walled garden but most PC users I know are not interested in expanding their own machine.If I wanted to experiment with hardware I'd go for a Raspberry Pi in a heartbeat. Very much fun for a cheap as dirt machine. It's not a gaming rig, to be sure, but you can hack them all you want and do zany stuff with it.
1 I understand the hair pulling. The thing that gets me on PCs is the Control Panel. I don't know who makes that but I believe they have a deep-seated hatred for humanity. Wow...Other than that: I've been working with 7 for years. Very solid experience. It's not pretty but it definitely works.And it does fun things sometimes. Make a new user: you can't create this new user because it does not exist yet [um... yeah?]. I've used both equally extensively, I don't want anything else than a Mac for home use. I really don't need the hassle [mostly the notifications that annoy the crap out of me]I used to be a big holy warrior back in the day but I no longer do that. You use what you want to use, have as much fun as you can!
2 I think the lack of game support would be the biggest motivating factor there. 
1 I am writing native plugins for Unity as a freelancer but so far I never supported Mac & iOS. I currently use CMake to then generate an xcode project but there is a lot of stuff that only exists in the apple world. Like bundles, frameworks, signing apps, universal libraries, lots of compiler flags you need to get exactly right or you get random crashes or the app store returns an error message while trying to publish months after a project is completed ... Edit: It is all really easy if I use XCode itself but in the moment I try to do it cross platform it gets bad
1 Honestly, we got the lesser of two evils as President, and that obviously says something. People voted for Hillary out of ignorance and believing in BS, while voting for Trump because of his outlandish offensiveness and rhetoric/media playing. Both options were terrible, but Hillary was a guaranteed utter failure who cares less for people than anyone else (proved it herself while she ran Bill's Presidency), where as Trump wasn't (still isn't, but man is he hard to stomach). It was stage 3 versus stage 4 cancer, where the majority of people voted for stage 4, with the electoral college auto-correcting it to stage 3. We avoided the cold-blooded devouring beast for the hot-blooded obnoxious pig.I'm not speaking to the validity of the electoral system in today's era, as its original purpose was to steer uninformed popular votes from horrible choices when people would go years without hearing about any politician, but I'm glad for what happened in this case. I didn't, wouldn't and couldn't vote for Trump, but man was I relieved when Hillary lost.
3 >How are you going to power the 400 watt PSU lol.They're called power cords. Did you know laptops have power supplies with cords too? So two power plugs and you're in business. 
3 Gotcha, appreciate it!
1 If you can get some details on the CPU youtube the processor model number and "gaming".  You should find a few people like me that decided to share performance videos.  Also you can compare benchmarks on the Futuremark Community website.

1 I just ordered Rick and Morty stickers for my brother for 0.99$  He was begging me for a week
9 Who the hell is the 0.1% using Vista?!
2 Considering the mobile market this shouldn't come to a surprise to anyone.
1 Windows alone still has more than 50% market share. And that is for Devs.Your regular corporations will have 90+% Windows.That's why it's far more lucrative to write malware for Windows.
-1 Hmm, I wonder why that is. Perhaps Mac users could be considered "[whales](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=whale)" due to their propensity and ability to spend. 
1 That doesn't count; they use some weird proprietary thing.
2 I like that Mac OS allows you to forgo the hint.  Windows makes you create one so I just do a single space as my hint.  Am I really going to forget my password?
1 It's still a thing. Macs are becoming more popular but they are still faaaaar behind Windows. As a malware developer you go for the biggest market.
4 No it didn't.
3 To be fair, OS 9 and OSX are two completely different operating systems. It's not comparable to versions of Windows.
1 Don’t even get me started about iOS’ security features. Holy shit it’s insane
2 >  I just don't get why people pay so much for these machines.The build quality is just top notch. Same way people pay for "premium" PC cases when building a desktop. PC cases can run from $49 - $300+ depending on what you get. (anything from a cheap cooler master, to fancy InWin cases) Some people prefer that. The same way some people prefer a fancier case when building a PC. It's purely aesthetic. The hardware inside is really the same. (Intel CPU's, SSD's, etc) it's nothing special/different. 
2 It was during a Full Metal Alchemist airing 
9 Well that analogy just doesn’t work once it came to be known that Disney killed those lemmings.
3 Not an apple user but they are actually killing it. Every company I visit - especially startups, are all on Macs. My company used to be mostly pc. Now it’s 60% Apple. There’s been huge a shift for sure. 
1 Yeah, but in a marketing sense, a tablet =/= a 'computer.' This commercial is saying you don't need a desktop or a laptop because this iPad can do everything.
0 I've used both as well. I'm by no means savvy with computers, but on a PC I feel a sense of "this is my space, I can do whatever I want with it." PC really gives a sense of free flow. Something as simple as downloading some music is complicated on my Mac. If I want to organize some files I can write a quick script on PC but it's not so easy on a Mac (as far as I know). If part of my computer isn't working I can take it out real easy and replace it with a part on Amazon on a PC. On a Mac I had to jump through all these hoops to fix my video card. Even very simple things like there not being a full taskbar makes it clunky to do multiple types of work at once.Just the little things for the most part.
1 Does Grandma really need a computer then? I'd imagine she could do whatever she wanted on an iPhone or tablet. In my eyes a computer is a machine that's inherently complex and meant for doing a lot of different types of work, and the Macs stifle that a little bit.Just barely though. Ultimately Macs and PCs are so similar that I'm just nitpicking.
2 I through iphones had the best processors out there, i could be wrong through
21 What's a nerd?
4 Would you care to specify? Not being an asshole, but I know that some cars can actually be a pain to change a tire on. My minivan for example isn't jack friendly. I had to buy a decent floor jack just to do it somewhat safely. 
1 I mean yeah, I can believe that if you've never done it before. But a lot of things are really hard to figure out on your own. If someone had shown you how it's done, you'd have been done in 10 minutes tops. 
1 To be fair trying to bust off rusted lugs with those shitting tire irons is a fucking task and a half. 
0 I wouldn't go around saying that. 
22 If they take an interest in it. My father wanted me to be a football star and I took to staring at computer screens, taking them apart and putting them back together. If my child decides they want an iPad so they can sit and draw because they care more about drawing than how far they can push processors then that's ok with me. I'll show them how to use the internet safely as a tool but if they don't wanna build PC's that's totally cool. Understanding is necessary, being an enthusiast isn't.
1 IMO kids shouldn't own anything better than an entry-level smartphone ala Xiaomi Mi A1 and a Raspberry Pi for a PC.Those two are more than enough to do everything a kid might need to do. The Raspberry Pi 3 is strong enough for Youtube and Web browsing, it will teach the kid about Linux and how to use it and you can even show off how to do some basic electrical stuff with it and how to program. It can even teach kids about emulation and how to configure games and input devices with them.
1 Do we work for the same company?
5 Yeah. Apple doesn't make low-end stuff, so their price point starts at $1000 but I still see macbooks walk in to my shop from 2008 in working condition. PC is such a broad term that it can't be used to describe anything anymore. I've seen $200 "PCs" that will die in a year and $5000 "PCs" that will have parts swapped out and upgraded forever. Not easy to nail down.
1 The biggest irritation for me is that you can't upgrade the OS on some of the older models, well not without hacking, anyway.
1 How so? My MacBook Pro from six years ago still outperforms the majority of my peer's computers. It does everything I need it to do and more, plus with bootcamp I've been able to enjoy Windows 10 as well. As an Architecture major, my life lives and dies by my computer. It has to be able to generate renderings of buildings and projects in resolutions upwards of 8K to be viable for larger prints (36''x98'') that I'm making, and often times I'm running Rhino 5, Revit, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop all at the same time. I've never run into any problems with my system.
1 ah, like an iPhone Plus?
-1 no, people care that they cant see shit. they buy these bigger screen and think they're going to be able to see shit better because they screen is bigger but no one told them the resolution is now 4x the size of their last screen and shit is now actually smaller than it was before.       making things usable is what people need and want. sure they like bigger tablets but most people would rather have 9" ipad they can use over a 24" monitor they cant see shit on, at least if you're referring to elderly people. 
1 NP. It all makes sense. Unfortunately something you might notice is that windows is moving more and more towards making their ui mobile-esque. It's not a big deal though, and the functionality is still there. As for your sister I'd actually recommend setting her up with a chrome book. It'd be a hell of a lot cheaper and would accomplish most of what she probably wants to do. But yes, I understand the base appeal of OS X and apple products in general. If you want a sleek premium looking, fully catered computing experience, and don't mind dropping more money than is probably warranted, a mac is your thing. But, in my eyes at least, any power user or tinkerer need not apply.  
1 What's a book? 
3 Sure, I'm sure it's easier to use overtime. But as to being in control, for me, using a macbook feels like i'm sitting in 1st class on a plane. Using a pc feels like i'm the pilot, if that makes sense ;)
1 I'd agree with most of this, but I dislike the trackpad on macbooks, partly because of the lack of being able to tap to click. Also, the battery life thing is just kinda dependent on what kind of laptop you have. I own an Acer R-14 that would last hours at a time while I played civ 5 or watched youtube videos on the train to and from university.
2 I have plenty of experience fixing apple products. they do some things better but a lot of things no so much. Im a linux guys (though I havent touched it in a while for reasons) so working with the mac command line to fix somethings is nice, some times nicer than windows. thankfully mac os doesn't break as much as windows or when it does its easy to set backup but its mostly the lack of documentation. When shit goes wrong in other systems there they're open enough that other people have found the details of why they're broken. when macs break searching shit on line for answers usually results in "tried to clear cache and failed, reinstalled, works now." or something nonsense like that. every now and again you find useful info at SuperUser.com (which is a fantastic site full of very knowledgeable users) but a lot of time if something breaks in mac you're kinda boned. I do like that they have a means of Factory Reset over the internet built into their system though.. makes me wonder why the fuck the iphones dont have that, or any other systems for that matter.       as for word processing on the ps4, never going to happen, or at least never really will need to happen, but thats not what I meant either. What I meant is that the game consoles are system that provide a simple, straight forward computing experience designed to do exactly what the system was advertised to do and very little else.       I think in the near future we'll end up seeing systems similar to game consoles in terms of interface and user end concepts. iOS is probably the closest thing to this with its very limited ability customize, strict app store, and minimal settings interface. We'll see these systems more as centralized home computing hubs though rather than consoles under your entertainment system, how they'll all connect idk.. either via thin client or direct emulated screencasting who the fuck knows. My point is the game consoles are really the one place I dont see to many people experiencing a lot of technical trouble with. maybe its just due to their audience, but I'd put my money on it being more of a super locked down system with easy to access content that requires little to no setup to experience.         
1 And resources. I work as a bench tech and a lot of OS errors and corruption I genuinely can't fix because I don't have access to the OS repair tools that an "Apple Technician" has access to. I can't afford to buy separate HDD cloning tools and other OS specific stuff for the seldom amount of Mac traffic I get.
1 That. Was. AMAZING!I have a 28" 4K (Gsync) monitor and watching that YouTube clip was amazing!
1 I really don't use the touch on my work laptops at all.
1 I don't know, I love being able to fold up my surface and go tablet with it. Sometimes you don't want the full laptop deal. Maybe it's just me though. 
1 No I think VGA displays all supported 1024
3 And there is where apple products excel. A macbook is similar to an xbox. In both cases a PC would have quite a bit more versatility, expandability, and in certain cases, specifically for enthusiasts, better performance. But just like many gamers want to pop in the disk and press play, confident that the game will start and run without a hitch, apple users can be relatively confident that when they attempt to do something they've done a hundred times before, it'll be just the same this time. That's a confidence that admittedly PC users won't always have. Between third party software, thousands of possible hardware setups and the ubiquitous user error, a pc will generally be less smooth than a macbook. And I think everyone can agree that Rasberry Pis are great :)
2 Oooh, don't get me started on the Control Panel!  I've switched to using the search feature to find the setting I want to adjust, because - especially in Win10 with its schizophrenic dual settings logic (classic configuration screen and Modern UI Options) - it's such a chore to find what you're looking for. Even worse is working on non-English computers: I always use English versions of software, which means that when I have to fix something on someone else's computer I'm completely lost, because I have no clue how even common features and settings are named in Dutch (they're usually pretty nonsensical).
0 This. If a macbook had all the latest hardware, it still wouldn't matter when you can count the amount of supported games on your hand. You could dual boot I guess, but then you're waaaay overpaying for what you're trying to do.
-1 Omfg.  I give up. You think the AC outlet in business class can support a 400 watt PSU?  People already have problem charging a gaming laptop on an airline, let alone an external GPU.This is why Apple users get a bad rep. You  think you ar tech savvy but you don't even know basic stuff.  I wasted enough time replying already.  Have fun carrying the external GPU to business class. 
2 Yeah I'm gonna look in the morning. I'm glad people like you share these videos.
5 ahh ok, "Men Going Their Own Way". that makes sense.
10 A combination of old people who don't know how to upgrade and people who don't like change and genuinely think it's the best OS
6 That's not really how that term works. Just buying expensive shit doesn't make you a whale.
5 For me, it is all the qualities of Unix, but without the headaches of Linux. Not that I don't like Linux, it's great, and I do use it a lot. But I has as of yet not found a Linux user who didn't spend hours or days on getting touchpad, WiFi, graphics cards etc. to work. Some have even given up, and are using a semi-working system.So when IT is my subject of study, work and hobby, the price isn't that important.
1 Windows does that now? Too bad. 
3 It's a perfect analogy.Apple is deliberately throwing its customers off a cliff while filming and editing it to look like meaningless, brain dead suicide.
3 it's good to hear that. i think Apple would do great to put some time and effort into their OS. it feels like it's stagnated. 
1 Yes but every company with over 500 employees is run by Linux. 
9 But it can't, and trying to replace what it is is what makes it so dumb.
2 Only someone who asks "What's a computer?" would actually believe that. Tablets are Utter Shite. Mobile TDP. Arse Graphics. Repairability of a glass window. Garbage tier storage. Not big enough to have all the ports. Can't multitask. Battery is flat (essentially means it has a CODBBB (chance of death by bloating battery) that's NormalLaptopBattery^2) 
1 Okay, I went and found some benchmarks and it does list the ipad pro 13 inch as being the best, however, it's a huge frigging tablet that's bigger than many laptops. Another apple product doesn't appear until 6th place with the other ipad pro. An iphone doesn't show up until *19th* place.https://www.futuremark.com/hardware/mobile
14 What is love?
2 I was sitting back and watching some friends change a tire and told them I'll help before they fuck something up.  They spent a good amount of time figuring out what was a "good part of the frame" to put the jack.   Then it took them a while to realize that the nut wasn't going to come off just by turning it, and that you needed some good umpf to loosen it up.  It was more about them being nervous about damaging something then it was not knowing what to do.  
2 Newer cars require you to take of the whole front end just to change a headlight.
1 I'm a networking security student and now when I speak with people about security it pains me. I would say the majority of users have the same password and username for the majority of their devices/programs/websites what have you.
1 that's how it was with my kids. i did a build for my son one year. i built it without him because he was a little too young and we wanted it to be a surprise. it was a good computer but it definitely needs some upgrades. he's starting to show interest in it now that some of his games won't run properly. my daughter is a bit younger than he is and she's starting to show interest, so as soon as money allows i plan to do a similar build with her. 
1 Wanna adopt me? I'll be the son who you can build a PC with.
1 I feel as if there's a balance. It would be wrong of your father to push you to pursue football seriously, but it's certainly a good thing for him to teach you how to exercise, work out, and learn athletic skills like agility and endurance.Likewise, you don't have to push your kid to become a computer scientist. But it's good to teach him or her the fundamentals of hardware (parts of a computer and what they do), software (what a programming language is and how it works), and networking (how to protect your privacy and what it means when a network isn't working).
2 Probably not, but i still share your feelings on computer safety.  
1 that's just the way it is. it also depends on support for those older OS's as well. for example i've got a G5 tower that's pretty cool. sure it runs OSX 10.4.11 so that i can maintain backwards compatibility with macOS 9, but it can still surf the web. there are even Linux builds out there for it. what i'm getting at is just because you can't upgrade the OS anymore doesn't mean it's worthless, there's still software out there that supports it. that said Apple does pretty good. i think the cut off is around the Core2Duo line. 
1 I should have directed that towards iPhones. I don't know many people that are satisfied with their IPhone 4 while my S2 and S3 still work fine.
4 You are patently wrong, higher resolution doesn't mean you can't scale up. So the larger screen obviously isn't invalidated by the capability to have a higher res.Anyways, I won't be responding to whatever weird shit you're going to say next.
1 Google it.
2 Haha oh yeah it makes sense. You know now that I think about it...it might be a mindset thing. I feel more at home on Ubuntu as well.  I appreciate that Microsoft is adding little things to emulate that experience. Adding stuff like tab view and multiple desktops is a huge plus in my book. 
2 because you know one platform, and don't know the other. I felt the same way until I got a mac in 2010. Fast forward to now, and having built a PC over the summer as well as using one for work, I felt a bit out of touch at first - it was very slow to get tasks done as quickly as I was used to. Now that I've re-aquainted myself I feel just as fast and comfortable on both systems. While there are differences, I'd say both are great tools that have immense complexity ready for you to take advantage of. iOS is great, but I think we can all agree that mobile operating systems are walled, restrictive, and dumbed down. 
1 Really? I used my Macbook for 2 days and went back on my old Asus laptop and was immediately annoyed at how bad it was.I do have the half-click on Macbook, don't know if that's default for all models? Works great for me.I do have to remind myself that the Macbook is 2-3 times as expensive as my old ones, so it's not too weird that it's much better at some things (like display, battery and trackpad).
1 I see what you're getting at there, I agree. Yeah documentation on how to repair a lot of things regarding mac is significantly lacking in comparison to Windows. Software perspective wise its usually a backup and restore option unless there's a fairly blatantly obvious solution. Sometimes that can be nice and sometimes it can be a curse. With Windows there's a lot of "it could be" and "if that fails try this" reboot, retry, rinse, repeat and at the end of it when you find the solution you forgot how many things you troubleshot and can't believe how far into a rabbit hole you had to go down to find a seemingly easy fix. I will admit my Linux skills are lacking mainly because I don't have a ton of need for it but I'd love to play with it more because of the amount of options it has.
1 I would argue with you on that a little. For the most part you just need to get 1 Mac. It doesn't even need to be an expensive Mac at that either. A Mac Mini will do fine. The Disk Utility tool on Mac is pretty nice for cloning. As long as you have a Cradle and a clean slate for OS X 10.9 OS errors are a breeze. Just take the files off the old HDD, wipe, clone the clean slate to the new HDD, update and put the files back on. No need for an Apple Technician. In my experience those guys don't know what their doing anyway. I had a genius tell me that I couldn't put Snow Leopard on a thumb drive and clone it to a HDD yet I've done it probably close to 100 times. It sucks that you do need a Mac to do those things but once you get the process down its pretty easy. 
1 good god do you have 2 1080ti's?
1 Exactly.Before you needed Visual Studio (very expensive) to write programs, but now a lot more is free. More so, its easy to convert it from Xbone, to Windows, to Tablet, to Phone. Had they announced that to developers 5 years ago, they would have had so much traction. Especially the idea that you could have one Spotify App that you just make responsive, or Pandora, or any app that is popular on console like it would be for phone.
1 Well, no. A surface is VERY different because it has that detachable keyboard. I hear of jobs where they just tell you that you have $2000 to buy what you want. If I ever do I would love to get a SurfaceBook. Having the ability to remove the keyboard and just use it as a tablet would be great.What I am meaning is people without a detachable keyboard, people aren't going to lean in to their PC to point when they can lean back and just click with a mouse and not obstruct their view or dirty their screen.
1 Everything else aside, the Control Panel, and then the Windows 10 version... man... that's such an annoyance. Also, I don't care for the interface, it's... it looks like someone wanted to do minimalistic and confused it with childish.Internet Explorer is an app, is not listed in the list of apps. Because that makes sense, obviously.
3 If you only consider the games, perhaps. But if you're buying a Mac, it's pretty safe to assume it's because you're doing stuff within macOS as well.
2 Who says I'm taking a commercial airliner? Little presumptuous of you there. 
6 Went to take a look at the subreddit:  "We are men going our own way by forging our own identities and paths to self-defined success; cutting through collective ideas of what a man is." - Ok, doesn't sound unreasonable, albeit a little strange to get together and create collective ideas of what a man is when you claim do to otherwise, but I'll reserve judgement. Then I read their rules: We will allow no:  1. Bullshit (ok, seems fair, I don't like BS too)  2. Feminist [sic] (well that escalated quickly! Time to nope out of this cesspool of unhealthy behaviour and lonely enraged red-pill men)  If I forge my own identity as a man, and consider feminism to be a position I agree with, then I'm not welcomed on a sub that claims to help men forge their own identity. This goes against their own #1 rule - No BS.   This sub is both toxic and ludicrously idiotic - so much so I thought it was satire. Sadly, it looks like satire it is not.    Stay out of it and stay classy, gents.

-2 What about a new iPhone every year?
-2 I know, that's why it's in quotation marks. Perhaps should have added "Per-se," but I'm sure you got my point
2 Bought a used laptop, installed Ubuntu in 3 minutes not a single driver issue on anything. The only time this is an issue is with knockoff Chinese keyboard, mice, and Wi-Fi dongles. 
1 If there is one thing I am willing to overspend a little bit on it is the one thing I use pretty much 12 hours a day. If performance to dollar ratio was the only thing people cared about, everyone would be sitting in that old stinky chair you love but your wife wants to burn, drive around in homemade finnish rally cars, or–god forbid–wear cargo shorts.
3 Well I'm guessing you're not the target market
1 I agree
1 Glass windows are way cheaper to repair than tablets and you can often do it yourself.
19 Baby don’t hurt me.Don’t hurt me.No more.What is love?
2 You'll find that when you enter the workforce this will be just a common, or they will use the simplest of passwords. That's why creating solid password police's is great, until they start complaining they can use their own simple passwords and that the hard ones are too hard to remember..
2 I'm mostly like this. I have different passwords for my main e-mail and another for my bank credentials, but for everything else I use variations of one password with different numbers. 
1 Serious inquiry - how much more secure is a password with a special character, like say ! in it, against being hacked? I noticed in the last maybe 5 years that almost every online account requires upper and lower case letters, numbers, and often at least one special character
1 Yea, because many people probably have over 100 different accounts that require a username/email and login.  Sure only some of those are used with regularity, but the number that most use is still high.  Most people are not going to remember 30 different passwords
1 The lack of security in 90% of the end users is alarming. Especially when they have credit cards and shit linked and they're like nah password is a great password. No wonder identity theft is a problem.
2 That is awesome and I hope when I have kids someday they do take an interest in building PCs and learning about how they work from hardware to OS. It'd be nice having a mini nerd to nerd out with about high end GPUs, CPUs and badass liquid cooling systems. You're kids are fortunate to have you as a parent, my first PC was a Quantex that my dad was going to throw out when he got his new Dell(God that Dell was terrible). Saved up for a HDD, replaced it, installed Windows and felt on top of the world when it booted to the setup screen. 
2 I mean if you have an income I'll consider. Poppa can't afford kids right now lol.
0 i know that.. it does not mean that you cant scale things up, but rarely content is. i've talked to tons of elderly people who thought getting a bigger screen meant being able to see shit better. I scale up the text size or and or draw back the resolution depending on the system limitations. thing is not all content scales and now they're having trouble seeing shit they could actually see better before. bigger screens does not necessarily mean they're going to see shit better. 
2 Oh yeah, the desktops are super handy.
1 That's fair.
1 Android is not that walled. We have the source code and we can do shit with it compare to other mobileOSes.
1 Thing is in a lot of cases people really could use the one existing without any trouble. It's like Mac in a lot of ways that it's very locked down with the right setup. But unlike Mac it doesn't necessarily have to be. Although I suppose that Mac can have root enabled but even still so much of it is proprietary it doesn't matter. After XP was expired I switched my grandmother's computer over to a very minimal Fedora install. Granted there is a obvious small learning curve she was able to pick it up relatively easily after I showed her how to use a few things that were a little different. However just like Windows it requires set up catered to the user. Warmack tends to shine is that it pretty much has most of what the general public users need from a clean install. If you gave most people a Windows computer with a clean install and nothing else they usually be screwed.Level of customization in Linux really nice and if it wasn't for the fact that I primarily play Dota 2 and OverWatch I would be running Linux right now. Whenever I get bored of OverWatch I'll probably switch back 
2 Fair. My company just cant warrant spending that much money in order to do the 3-5 mac jobs that come through the door each year. If it was cheaper-free or there was a larger populace of mac users that didn't just throw it out and buy a new one at the first sign of issue, maybe. But as it currently stands in our market it's just not super worth it.
0 Right. But what exactly could you do on a mac that you couldn't do an a pc?
1 This is just getting pathetic. Apple fanboys crack me up.  
1 I'm pretty sure all governments are still using XP

1 Some small discrepancy is required. Say your password is Hunter2... Hunter2Ggl for Google and Hunter2FcBk for Facebook. Every little bit helps. 
1 i was fortunate. my stepdad was into computers and so was my uncle. they helped me along my path. when i was 15 or so i got given my first real computer. my uncle built it for me. it wasn't extravagant, but it was totally upgradable. i eventually put a voodoo3 in it and haven't looked back since. 
1 I feel ya, I got a 4 year old and these little fuckers will drain ya dry, I do need to build a new rig though and I'm hoping my Christmas bonus affords me the opportunity, I haven't built a rig in like 10 years though so it should be interesting.
1 Can't you just change the resolution? Not everyone needs UHD.
1 Speaking from experience, Logic Pro and Final Cut for starters. (I produce music and edit video) .. Getting my text messages, phone calls, facetime, etc on my laptop so I can use a full sized keyboard and large screen instead of my phone. Also haven't found a Windows web development environment anywhere near as good as Coda.I'll admit I do most (not all) gaming on my PC. Can't beat the Mac for productivity, though. Just have far fewer frustrations with it than I have with Windows.
1 Damn dude I had to look up voodoo3 tbh. I didn't start getting involved with GPUs until the mid 2000s. Was a lot of my friends hardware at the time because I was working with Mac stuff at the time. I remember a friend opening his Nvidia 8800 gtx and wondering how he was going to use all that power lol.
1 Not on every device 
2 Media creation tools abound on windows. I've used Lightworks, an open source video editor, but there are many options. Same for music. With Cortana you can also send/receive sms from your pc, but you will have to use a VoIP app for calling unless you want to buy another sim card. Don't do much web development, so I can't speak to that specifically, but many tools are available for coding in general. A simple tool I use is notebook++. I can't argue though, that you are probably less likely to run into bugs on an apple computer.
1 Are you talking about phones and tablets?
3 I've used Windows my whole life and still do, and I've used many capable media creation tools. Nothing that strikes me as well as Logic and Final Cut. It's not so much a question of what it does, it's how it does it. I have no loyalties, and am far from a fanboy. I do appreciate the 'it just works' factor, though. Especially with my messages and phone calls. I don't need to use Skype or get a separate phone number; it just works with my existing stuff.
2 Yeah, I made a similar comment further down somewhere. That is the advantage that osx has is that it will generally require less setup and troubleshooting than a similar task in windows.
1 No more /r/thatHappened comments please. 😒

1112 And his name? Andre Einstein
619 Everyone clapped and the airline gave him a crisp 100 dollar bill
359 Ah yes, the classic "and then everyone clapped"
5325 Man fuck outta here with that shit. I used to fly all the time for work and had baller status so I'd always be upgraded. Some days I would fly out the next morning instead of right after my meetings so I'd look hella bummy in joggers and gym shoes compared to my usual suit and tie, the fucking side eye I'd get when the flight attendant would bring me a drink and thank me for being a Diamond status flyer. You'd think that I was flying to interracially dick down these motherfuckers daughters in front of them. 
330 I bet literally the only thing that happened was, the lady behind him came up and asked if this was the line for priority boarding...
157 And then former president and well-known negro Barack Obama came in and handed out $100% bills with George Washington Carver's face on them.
80 Nobody at an airport gives a shit about you enough to listen to a petty argument, let alone clap afterwards.

49 This guy had me until the clapping.
71 "Everyone claps"Fucking cringe.
48 And then the pilot handed him a hundred dollar bill.
162 Fake and gay
251 I don't understand why people in first class/near the front would want to board first.  You're just sitting on the plane longer.  Board last, where you don't have to wait for anything, and then get off the plane first... least amount of time on the plane.
94 Yeahhhhh that didn't happen. Good message though.
28 AND THEY ALL STARTED CLAPPING!!1!2 WOWIE. Jesus fucking christ.
22 Guys in the back are clapping pretty furiously.

15 Just so you guys know, every story that ends with "everybody in line clapped" are a bunch of total bullshit.

4 Like, late night I'm on a first class flight  The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright  I sit down in my seat, 2C  She approach officially, talking about, "Excuse me"  Her lips curl up into a tight space  Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place  Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped  All embarrassed, put an extra lime on my water glass    An hour later here she come by, walkin' past  "I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph"  [mr mos def](https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-mr-nigga-lyrics)  
3 This reminds me of the other day. I was getting in line to board a plane and it was pretty crowded, so I asked this black kid who was in line, "Group 1?" (priority lane on United). He was like "yes", and then he kind of looked around and walked away. I felt super bad, like he probably thought I was being racist and calling him out like he didn't belong in Group 1. Anyway, that's my story.
4 And they all started clapping! Wooo yes! And this is a true story! Wooo yes!
3 Mr. Nigga
3 “Excuse me, m’am, you must be in the wrong place. Priority seating for the direct flight to St. Luciferburg, Hell is over there” 👉

9 wonder if this is true...
5 was very believable until 'too big', says outloud 'nigga with money', and clap parts.
3 and everyone clapped
3 Russian Troll?
1 I don't think the story is completely fake, but he certainly added some shit.
2 If he has so much money, why hasn't he gotten that thing frozen off his eye?
1 "He must me one of those rap guys."
1 A better shot back would have been: “ not in the military but you must have had a rich guys dick in your mouth to be in first class.” 
2 This should be posted on Russian People Twitter not Black People Twitter. 
2 Yep totally happened 
2 Anyone else read her quote in a southern accent? Of course that’s my go to “racist “ accent in my head 
2 Yeah I'm still calling bullshit on this.I fly so fucking much and I can only imagine what I must look like. Nearing 30 dude bummed the fuck out in whatever is most comfortable and most definitely don't look like I belong in first class or business.Hint. I fly so damn much for work that I am a Gold member (hehehehehehe) and I occasionally get to upgrade my seats for free to first class or business if it's available.Since most of the red eye flights are open I usually get lucky.
2 “Everyone clapped, then the entire airport did the wave starting with me in celebration, while celebrate good times was playing over the loud speaker”
2 AND THEN EVERYBODY CLAPPED AND ALBERT EINSTEIN WAS THERE

4 sounds like r/Tumblerinaction
8 This is the kind of person that probably doesn't even realize they're being racist and therefor will feel no shame or remorse because her assumption in her twisted brain was reasonable.
4 And then the president showed up and gave him 100$%s
4 Why do they always include the clapping? It’s the deadest giveaway that this is bullshit. I don’t doubt that people in airports are assholes. That’s par for the course. But why you gotta lie like this? 
2 is this some kind of gangster rapper?
3 And then I stood up and said "black power!!!" and the whole class cheered. 
3 This is clearly fake
3 It was all going so well until the clapping part. 
3 So bizarre that people believe this shit.

2 *people start to clap* stfu
1 FOH
0 I just flew around the word with multiple connecting flights and all first class passengers were of different races. I'm calling /r/that happened. If you fly first class, you MUST know that it's extremely diverse. Unless this lady being called out is from a primarily white town and this is the first time she's ever flown first class.
1 Seems really fake.
1 My hero!
1 Look at that long line of people behind them!
1 Fake.
1 Shit that never happened for 1000 please Alex.
1 that's some hilarious stuff! 
1 Man just pop that cyst already damn!
1 If you have $, take care of that thing by your eye. 
1 We have created a culture wherein people fantasize about being victims.
1 And then then $100% dollar bills came out of the sky. The bill had Albert Einstein’s face on it. 
1 Then the entire crew ate the fish, but thank God he was there to safely land the plane.
1 I don't want to downvote because then it seems like I'm being racist, but I did anyways because this $100% happened
1 Stupid btch! That's what she gets
1 But theres only 2 people in line
1 Haha he actually ended it with "then everyone clapped" lol
1 Stupid bitch
1 I know that I've(wrongly and ignorantly) had thoughts similar to this lady's at various points in my life. I know that I've looked at someone and made an assumption that, in hindsight, wasn't fair to make.But for the life of me, I can't fathom ever saying it out loud!! 
1 Seriously ? Can you believe the comments she made? How can this lady be so smug and rude? Wth is wrong with people?
1 military don't even get first class no?
1 That BRAVE mans nam?  Albert "nigga with money" Einstein! 
1 why people are always bad.
1 And if he was military then it would have been fine with her to cut in front of him?So, no morals at all.Bet she is a good god fearing ho, though.
1 a warm compress might work that sty on his eyelid down a little bitsource: had a sty once, it's just hardened wax in your glands, gotta slowly melt that shit
1 Plot twist: It's the DMV.
1 Don't military and veterans seat first anyways?
1 This makes me so fucking happy. 
1 Who actually _wants_ to get on the plane first? Seats are reserved!
1 That didn't happen. 
1 Shit title and fake content, I’m disappointed 
1 i have a hard time believing this is real.

0 Although I do not believe this happened, I've met enough people to know that this could happen.
1 Totally real story. I was there. 
1 Maybe he was in the wrong line, that flight was clearly going to the 1850's
1 Just like the j Cole line from sideline story. 
1 I thought this was r/cringeanarchy
1 *too big
1 Must be military or something? So fuck those in the military ?? They need to wait? 
1 Hell yeah!  My in-laws used to get us business class from Singapore to Orlando.  People would give my family’s lower middle class dirty looks all the time. 
1 Was Obama there? 
1 Lol I fly about 4-6x a month for work, occasionally get bumped up to first class whenever I don’t use southwest. Anyhow, I’m a large brown dude and have never faced any sort of discrimination while boarding first or business, even when I wear shorts and a T-shirt. In fact, demographically speaking, non-whites (excluding Hispanics), are super overrepresented in the fronts of planes This dude is likely full of shit. 
1 Why are individuals confidently speaking for other people in saying this or that would never happen? Like just because you personally would never do something doesn’t mean that someone else won’t. Seriously.
1 ow.
1 Reminds me of the ‘random’ searches I go through when flying intl 
1 Perfect place to post it and get people to believe it happened lul
1 I wish she'd been looking up. Then facebook would suggest "tag Alice McQueef?" No hiding behind money,  lady racist. I hope your flight was lovely!
1 U a nigga with a bigass keloid on your eye
1 Her hair looks like it's glued in place. 
1 I'll take "Never happened" For 500 bucks Sharon
1 He should have ended this with "And then I looked down at my pants and they were on fire! Because I was lyin' to y'all!"
1 Fake and gay
1 thats not *priority boarding*
0 Why you gotta refer yourself as "another nigga"? You are THE man!
0 Trump effect
1 I don't get why people want to board first. I prefer to board last and get off the plane first. Boarding first means you have to sit on the plane longer. I would rather be free in the waiting room until I have to cram into my seat.
1 I’m sure that happened
1 Black people love their fake racist stories.
1 the part where everyone claps made the story lose the realism 
1 I believed it all the way up to the clapping 
1 when the supply of racism is smaller than the demand ...

0 Ah, white people with money. A truly humble people.
1 Obama was there,
2 >nope to big to ever be in anybodies I had no idea what he was saying in this sentence for a good minute.
1 Should probably get that keloid looked at. Also, this is fake.
1 Then everyone did a single jumping jack, did the harlem shake, and broke into song while holding hands and circling around the woman. 
1 Let her fucking know 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
1 I can imagine everyone there starting a slow clap
1 Cool story, that is all this is. It could be true but I don’t see no one clapping all I see is some creepy guy taking a pic of some lady at an airport.
0 How many people here are actually Black? I can totally believe this happened. These types of microaggressions are real as fuck. In fact, J. Cole has a line in his song "Chris Tucker" where he shares a similar sentiment: "Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ayyShe think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?Next time I'ma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon' shock her"You're so tall, what team do you play for?" No bitch, I'm a doctor"
-1 What a racist bitch. Trump is definitely making these people feel more comfortable saying this shit out loud in public.
0 Shitty. A life lesson her privilege probably never taught her - book cover and its contents. how someone dresses is not indicative of their class. 
1 He needs to pay for another seat for that fucking gremlin on his eye.
-2 Ma'am it looks like your white card has been declined. Do you have another form of privilege we could try using?
-1 Whats the point in paying extra to be the first to board the plane? You will reach your destination at the same as anybody else.
-7 She got that can i speak to your manager haircut!
-1 This reminds me of the band I was in in high school... Debilitating Stye.
-1 Lady RESIGNED 😂😂😂
1 Sorry I believe his belongs in r/BlackPeopleFacebook.
0 shouldve asked her if he can sit at the front of the first class area or not. 
-10 I bet her head’s down cause she’s aggressively Facebook statusing about a rude thug that just ruined her travel experience. Probably also complaining to the airline about how she spent money on first class and it no longer feels like first class. Edit: I pity the fools who read this comment and interpret it as my agreeing with what I’m suggesting this woman’s reaction is. Reading comprehension and context clues has gone by the wayside. 
0 It's like priority boarding is for older white people. Since I book through my dad's account because he has way more miles, sometimes I get bumped up. I got strange looks the last time I flew because I'm on my 24 and everyone else in priority was 30+. It's bs
0 Looks like he cried a Milk Dud.
-2 Those people are cancer on society. They vindicate themselves by beating down others. Wish she was barren.
-1 Yeah I almost believed this story until you talked about the clapping. Ain't nobody gon do that shit in an airport. White people only clap when a plane lands.
-3 A "nigga with money" would've had that thing removed a long time ago.
-3 Wait wait wait wait wait wait. Military gets first class?EDIT: Why the downvotes? I believe military *should* get first class. I'm military, that'd be fucking awesome if I can actually get first class.
-3 I feel like you should be legally permitted to punch her in the face.

934 Then the gate agent gave him a $100 bill for his troubles. Not saying this story is fake but the clapping part is a trademark of fake internet stories 
2255 Yes. I'm not doubting that black people experience this when flying first class. And I'm not even saying that this guys didn't experience something similar to this that inspired this story. But every fake story ever on the internet ends with "And everyone started clapping".
173 And then the pilots offered the ticket for free, and gave him a bottle of champagne. The lady had her seat changed so she had to sit on the left turbine. 
172 I was rooting for him until that. Like nobody else is behind you 😂
102 Man, I did have people clap for me at an airport gate once while I was in the military. I was getting ready to deploy and the gate agent called that shit over the speaker. People clapped. It was embarassing and awkward as fuck. 
9 “Everyone clapped and laughed. A random woman came up to me and handed me her number. Then the pilots invited me to the front of the cabin and gave me the pilot wings badge.” 
17 That happened material as soon as I saw that.
10 Yeah made the entire story look fake.
9 I mean it may sound unreasonable, but sometimes people are genuinely happy to see someone get shut the fuck down. I had a late night flight while in NY and while waiting this woman had missed her flight and flipped shit started bawling, yelling at attendants, cursing at her husband she even tried to open the door to the fucking gate. This went on for about 20 minutes before the police arrived and she still kept on screaming and crying until some random guy just yells shut the fuck up lady no one gives a shit and we all have our own problems. He got a fucking standing ovation from all the pissed off people with delayed flights that already had enough shit to worry about.
5 Nonsense, they let him pilot the plane for a bit once it hit cruising altitude.
2 If I was going to tell a story like this, even if the clapping actually happened I think I would leave it out.    Evokes memories of a certain euphoric mountain dew connoisseur.
2 You really think someone would just go on the internet and lie like that?
2 No way, I totally believe it. Claps and all. You meet some of the most backward ass people in the airport. Am sure people were cringing the moment this bird head opened her mouth to speak. Handling any kind of racist-assery with tact will get people to clap.
2 Yeah that bit read like a 4chan greentext
2 I would've clapped.  Sometimes people clap.
1 It is an American airport to be fair
1 Everyone clapped as the plane landed
0 Yep, me too. 
830 I was there. Over $100% people clapped
30 A couple of other pilots who were already in the air heard what happened, turned around and landed their planes just to shake his hand. 
15 That lady's name? Albert Einstein.
3 Seriously. What a ridiculous tale. I feel bad for the random lady who was probably just minding her own business and got swept up in this tall tale.  Thankfully she hardly can be IDed. 
1 How it actually happened:"Lady: Are you in line to board?""Guy: Yeah.""Lady: Okay."*FIN*
185 And the pilot gave him $100%
22 I didn't even realize it *wasn't* that happened until I loaded in to read the comments. How can anyone believe crap like this? It's literally just a picture of a guy standing in line taking a creep shot of a woman standing behind him with an incredibly made up sounding story attached.

1 I'm the 200th upvote
1752 Honestly more than 50% of people I see in first class I dressed pretty sloppily.
262 I've never understood flying in a suit if you have time to change when you get there or are coming home. The only excuse for flying in a suit is that you have to go straight to a meeting once you land. Other than that you definitely just want to look like Mr. First Class. 
18 Honestly the people who fly the most will usually look bummy unless they got shit to do right after they land. The real baller status and how you get the most looks is that TSA bypass where you don't have to fuck with security anymore.
13 Flew business class from New York to Tokyo once in sweats, cons and a t-shirt. When I dress down, I look like a 16 year old kid.Got very confused looks from the other people in the cabin. Especially when I started ordering drinks 😂
23 Shit I go to the airport in sweats and a hoodie at 4 pm 
7 Oh man, used to get this all the time too when I used to fly for work.  Would often fly standby and get free upgrades to first class, then get these weird stares when I walked into the first class lane wearing steel toe boots and covered in sweat and sawdust.
5 I've been on hundreds of 1st class flights and not once, ever, has anyone questioned anyone else's right to be in first class nor has anyone ever said anything remotely close to 'I get to board first.'I'm not saying this didn't happen but I'd need a video to believe it.  First Class passengers are getting on the plane first regardless, it doesn't mean shit to us one way or another if a couple of people are in front of us - we are still going to have to wait 30 minutes for everyone else to board and we are still going to get a drink or two in that time.
5 I’m white, but unless going straight to a meeting I always fly first class in sweatpants and a hoody. If it makes you feel any better they act the exact same way toward me. However I love looking like I don’t belong there because I know it upsets stuck up idiots. 
20 Interracial dick downs are also good though
3 Same way my buddy is. He’s been traveling to a different city weekly for the last two and a half years for his job. Diamond status for flights, million flyer points, suites for hotels. He’s always In first class, first one to board the plane. He’s literally the least and most modest dude to ever fly first class. He loves it tho. Shows up in joggers with Chaco sandals and a Patagonia t-shirt lol
3 And you wonder why people think you're an animal. 
1 Bro most of us who fly first class are dressed sloppy.  Why the hell would I wear my shit if I just gotta press it before my meetings?  Cramped airplanes is the easiest way to get gross creases in my business attire.Way to make stuff up for internet points.
0 I used to fly out for business often with my last job. Instead of taking a cab to the airport I used a limo service and would get all the strangest looks when I stepped out of a stretch with a backpack and a craftsman tool bag.
0 that was great, i nearly spit my drink onto my keyboard
1 Used to work in oil, am I diamond member with Hilton.Backpacked around Europe with my little brother when he graduated college and the looks people gave us when we walked up to the desk in our clothes we slept in on the train the night before only the be upgraded to the nicest room in the hotel was absolutely comical.Same with the executive lounge. We would make it a point to go every night and have an irish coffee in our clothes we just wore all day.So. Much. Fun. 
1 I'm literally clapping.
1 But you sound like such a professional, kind person! I'm amazed they took issue with your shitty, self righteous, race card using attitude. 
1 > You'd think that I was flying to interracially dick down these motherfuckers daughters in front of them.Are you a poet?
1 For what it's worth, us whites that dress sloppily with beards get the same treatment, and based on my beard length, probably more "random" frisks. 
1 As someone who flies often but never in first class, I can assure you the only people that judge are the people who never had to travel for work. 
1 Sounds like the premise for a film I might be interested in watching.
1 I'm white so doesn't really count but my favorite time getting upgraded was coming back from a 2 week backpacking trip, when I was 25 I was showered etc but had tons of dirty/ratty gear. Got bumped to first, it was glorious.
1 That probably isn't because you're black. It's just because you're dressed poorly.
0 White Meat, Black Treat.
-2 That last line killed me
28 So nobody clapped? Sad.
2 And he wanted to show off he had so much wealth that he can afford priority boarding. Wish I was that flush 😂
1 And he sad no.
1 Ah, but that wouldn’t have gotten featured on this sub.
1 Finally some respect for the man who literally invented the peanut
-8 The fuck is a $100% bill?
2 I almost forgot this gif existed. I've missed it.
3 and it was a *crisp* $100, too
56 Mythological and bicurious
18 Fictional and homosexual 
10 CNN and CNN
2 Artificial and homoerotic
1 Fake if gay
231 The only benefit is getting to drink while everyone else lines up. The con though is everyone is walking past staring at your ass drink whiskey at 7am on a Monday flying out for the week. 
64 1) welcome drink2) overhead luggage storage
14 they want all the plebs walking to economy to see them chillin in first class.
21 Because when the plane smashes in to the ground, they get there first. 
10 Get the good overhead spots to put carry-on luggage. If you're in first class then you can get a good spot in the overhead compartments *and* have a drink/be relatively comfortable while the plebs wait in line.
3 Really?? Sitting in first class while waiting for the rest of the plane to board is 100x more comfortable than waiting outside in shitty seats. You get a drink, and can start watching movies or doing whatever you want to do. Plus you get to look at all the poor people pass and fling crumpled up dollar bills at them. 
2 Spending less time on the plane is not a big deal when you have a nice spacious seat, and unlimited booze/snacks.You can plug in your equipment and start watching a movie right away. You can fall asleep without worrying that you will miss your flight. Lots of upsides to boarding first, especially in business or first class.Some plans march the plebs past you, which is annoying. But its still better than waiting out in the boarding area standing in line. 
1 I always just wait so by the time I get on the plane we are about to take off. UNLESS I get bumped to first. Then I’m fuckin gettin on there the second those doors open! They got free drinks up in there!
1 I would imagine sitting in first class seats are much better than sitting in an airport waiting room or standing in line. Also, rich people don't wait. 
2 Claustrophobia. Once everyone is already in heir seats the aisles are so tight. If you're carrying a bag it's almost impossible not to hit people on either side with it. It's really easy to trip because people feet or bags will be sticking out into the aisles. And then there will be somebody fucking with stuff in the overhead compartment blocking the line so you'll get trapped standing there hovering over the people in their seats. 
1 If I board later, I find the overhead bins taken, by people not on my row. 
1 Every flight I’ve been on the front of the plane gets off first too... while I’m in the back waiting for an eternity for everyone else and miss my connecting flight
1 Well, the actually decent seats help.
1 The boarding process is stressful. I am not relaxed waiting outside, as soon as I sit in my chair I am able to relax a little bit.
0 I hold in farts for when I walk through first class. So they get to enjoy that, too.
-2 They want everyone to see them sitting there being special.  And somehow waiting on the plane is better than waiting in the airport.  Also lady WTF if it turns out he can't get on they won't let him, just fucking wait and let it play out.
-3 > 't understand why people in first class/near the front would want to board first. You're just sitting on the plane longer. Board last, where you don't have to wait for anything, and then get off the plane first... least amount of time on the plThe ONLY reason I like to board  first, is ~~if~~ when my 'carry on' is obviously skirting the acceptable size (large backpacking sack) to know I can fit it. My social anxiety will not let me be that person that gets on the plane that has no place to put my carry on. I usually just stop at the counter and ask if its a full flight and if they are asking people to check for free for a "one-time" pass. 
1 As a former service worker, privileged white women have no bounds. 
2 Funniest comment I have ever seen
4 100% likely 
2 lol that’s exactly what happened 
1 My African American boyfriend told me about some white people who laughed in his face when he told them he’s in college like wait...you’re serious? My point being just because you haven’t experienced something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
68 Or he made it up 
24 Or its just a made up story to draw attention to himself. 
198 That's how it's always been in America. Black soldiers would come home from fighting wars just to be told to sit in the back of the bus or not be afforded the same jobs white soldiers got. Similar stuff still happens today too. 
5 Soldiers in general get little respect anymore.
2 “Nope to big to be in anybodies military” made me dislike this guy. I can understand political reservations but “too big”? Rich assholes in 1st class deserve each other IMO
-4 Because in this scenario this poc is encroaching on established lines of division. He’d get tons of respect if he was behind her waiting for economy class boarding. But now he’s in her element, which she paid for so she’s even more deserving, so it’s a problem because she and him are not supposed to be in the same circle or of equal status. This post may be a lie, I don’t know, but the logic above happens every day with racists. And it’s worse when they can hide it just enough with their explanations or whatever to deny that it’s actual racism behind it. 
-1 She just forget to hold X
-1 Yeah who are they fighting for? Using tax money to kill some nobodies on the other side of the world... Yeah thanks I guess
8 Because it's okay to be horrible to white people, bro. /s Then, when you point it out, they'll lock the thread with some dumbass "lol /r/all losers are here 😒" stickied comment.
34 Idk who you mean by we 
2 People actually believe this story is real? This one's just painfully obvious.
-129 Who the fuck is we? White people? Shiit they don't claim youEdit : got some weird PMs, just wanted to clarify that white people doing shit like this is so widespread that 'not claiming' doesn't apply. Just like black people can't 'not claim' black rappers
1 .#embellishment but he was trying to make a point
1 OMG Becky.  Look at that girl’s butt!
27 type of person who doesnt exist.
10 The person who made the story up probably doesn’t think they are being racist either 
8 MAN! The 1st time I'd witnessed genuine racial ignorance my mind was blown. One of the rare moments I was at a loss for words
0 Clearly she didn't realize, since she stayed standing there right behind him.
2 What’s bizarre is the president is the president tbh
1 spot on... you can tell a lot by someones hair.
3 Are you sure? That might be a bit spicy for her.
16 Don't worry, this didn't happen. 
8 It’s fake buddy
0 Good thing none of this actually happened.
13 Overhead bin space. And if you're in first class quicker access to free booze and your comfy seat.
3 Not just to board first - to get a seat you actually fit in is the biggest perk.  And drinks while boarding, not an hour later.
1 You're paying extra to not have knee and back problems when you arrive because you aren't pretzelled up in a too small seat. Or so I hear. I haven't shelled out for it. 
0 [deleted]
1 What thing?
1 No
1 They get to board first
2 Or it's because she is using her phone and has no idea that some dude will take a pic and make a fake story just to get internet points.

1 White people assuming that large-bodied black people must be mistaken when they line up for first-class boarding is fully a Thing That Happens.

10 You nasty.
11 No. No it wasn't. But the clapping made it worse
1 [deleted]
0 He'a race baiting, which is worse than that
145 Then the gate agent said, "ma'am we won't make you sit next to this guy, we'll give you a special seat" and threw her in the cargo hold. 
53 >Not saying this story is fakeI will be the brave soul.This story is fake
105 That womens name, Albert Einstein.
142 >$100%Ftfy
46 The 👏 claps 👏 happen 👏 when 👏 the 👏 plane 👏 lands 👏
14 And then a flight attendant took him to the bathroom and sucked his dick. 
3 What really happened>excuse me sir...Yes mam?>hi im priority boarding. Can you let me by?Oh im actually priority boarding also see?>ohhh...alright then sorryThe following is how the story played out in his mind. 
1 Don’t forget his uncle works at Nintendo.
1223 And that flight's pilot? Albert Einstein
56 I had a flight end with the clap once...
27 Hell I'm in my mid 20s and have JetBlue Mosaic (work benefit) and get looks when I board first, plus the flight attendants come over and greet you when they get a chance. You feel like a baller and the looks you get are great.  I've had some salty people, like one girl trying to get me to order booze for her (Mosaic includes unlimited free alcohol on flights) then she got mad when the attendant told her it's for the member only, to add insult to injury he came over and offered my girlfriend some. But never clapping. 
5 Oddly enough I've actually had a story of mine end with people applauding after I stood up to someone in public. Sometimes I omit that part when telling the story just so people won't doubt my story as much.
1 Bravo.
1 I've been in these situations and clapped. I only do it when it's a black person speaking to anyone non-black though. 
1 Everyone clapped at the end of "Cool Runnings" and that definitely happened, soooo........
1 The entire theater I sat with clapped at the end of The Force Awakens. You seriously think the same dorks wouldn't clap at real life entertainment like this? I would. 
1 As a rule of thumb, I automatically doubt any story that ends in applause and/or free cash.
-1 I’ve seen a gif that played out exactly like a thathappened post. Try this on for size: so this guy walked into our lecture hall, shotgunned a beer, and walked out then everyone including the professor starting clapping. Sounds like bullshit right? I don’t have the link but this was a legit thing. I think it was part of a fraternity prank or something, but nonetheless it happened. 
0 No, this is all bullshit.
0 I have actually started clapping in real life when I see someone own someone else. It's a meek clap for my own internal joke/ pleasure. No one has ever joined me. The people I'm clapping at typically both look at me with disgust. It's probably my internal joke I never get to play. I also tell myself jokes then laugh at my own jokes constantly. Maybe I am schizophrenic or something. 
-3 I am doubting that black people have experienced this anytime in the last 40 years.
-3 Clapping is pretty normal when the asshole in a disturbance gets what's coming to him/her. Though I guess I usually fly Southwest, which is pretty egalitarian.
35 On the left turbine of the next flight.
2 I was once given bottles of champagne, although it was mainly as a fuck you to another passenger. Basically they needed to move some guy to be next to his wife and (crying) baby, and the guy was in a middle seat. So they asked the guy beside me and he declined, with a bit of a pissy attitude, but I just said sure and they moved us around. As we started buckling up for descent the flight attendant brought me over two small bottle sof champagne "to say thank you". She said it really loud so the guy who declined got the message. Anyway, that's not as good as the time I stole a window seat from a 4 star general...
1 Beside the gremlins 
20 Like dude you provided photographic evidence that you're full of shit. 
27 To those people, ignorant of your orders, you may have been sent to your death for a country they love.  At the very least you entered into indentured servitude on their behalf.  I am really anti-honor stuff but I'd say just it wasn't nothing to get embarrassed about.But in regards to this story, this man just had a short verbal sparring match with a bitter woman.  Like, who is clappin?
1 but black people cant race bait /s
1 Just remember, most people here are kids who haven't gone to college and still live at home. They don't think anything is real. 
243 Obama was there
1 Even the racist blonde lady clapped.
1 *100$%
1 im in his clan it's 100% real
30 And let him fly the plane to space to see the moon.
5 Which is really fucked up because it belittles people's real experience of racism
5 Shhh
8 "And then everyone clapped"

1 69 points.Nice.
19 Because the fake stories aren't trying to emulate life but some outdated Hollywood fantasy that have somehow persisted in the popular imagination to this day (I associate crowds clapping at some public character interaction with 80s and early 90s feel good flicks, e.g., last minute airport/train station scene  where the guy gets the girl, etc).
168 Probably because flying sucks and if you're going to be stuck sitting for hours on end you might as well be comfortable.
1418 But the moment a person of color did it, "THEY DON'T BELONG HERE, TREAT FIRST CLASS WITH SOME DIGNITY, THIS ISN'T A BACKYARD COOKOUT" or some other internal monologue headass comment. 
19 That’s because many ppl in first class have had to fly *constantly.* Unless I have a meeting where I’m going, I almost always fly in a hoodie, workout pants and 10 year old sneakers.I rarely meet anyone that pays for 1st class. They get it because of work.This and you leave as late as humanly possible to get to airport so you’re forced to drink at the bar for as little time as possible. Then drink for free on board.
26 I don't fly very often at all. Maybe every few years. But when I do, I make sure to save up enough to fly first class just because my big ass doesn't belong in those tiny ass seats. I make sure to roll in shaggy as fuck, on a bar and ordering drinks. Fuck em.
11 If you dress up for a flight, you don’t know what traveling is like
2 Wearing comfortable clothes when flying is key!
2 Honestly, if you're all dressed up to fly, ima look at you funny.
2 Who the hell wants to dress nicely (aka uncomfortably) when flying?   Flying is sweats and hoodies time, first class or not.
1 Yeah that just sounds like a fucked up attendant. I flew a few times in first class when I was younger and I'd be wearing nothing but sweats so I could try to get some sleep. Nobody cared. Maybe they're less racist towards Asians.Also they bring you a shitload of food in first class international flights. So weird compared to getting peanuts on coach.
1 When I fly I am dressed sloppy and casual as hell.  It's the only time I wear sweatpants out in public, if I'm going to be sitting in a plane seat for 5 hours at a crack, I'm wearing the comfiest things I own and screw how it looks.  This includes when I get cheap upgrades.  
1 Why the fuck would I spend money on being comfortable only to sit in a suit for 7 hours. Fuck that, if I could sit in the chair in a banana hammock without causing a terror alert, then I would. Unfortunately I'll settle for being in flip flops and comfortable sweatpants that make my butt look awesome. 
1 When you have fuck you money you don’t have to dress nice. Not that everyone in first class does, but still. 
1 I've flown so much I go in sweats and immediately pretend I'm asleep as soon as I sit down. Just get me there and shut the hell up. Flying before 9/11 was actually somewhat enjoyable. Now it's a pain in my ass - probably doesn't help that I'm brown. 
1 I fly back and forth between LA and Nashville, get upgraded to first class, see celebrities often. They’re almost always wearing sweat pants and looking like they just woke up. Saw Kristen Bell with what appeared to be no makeup and wearing sunglasses. Honestly only recognized her because of her voice when she was talking with her friend. The exceptions have been Jessica Alba and Nicole Kidman, who looked like they just stepped off a magazine shoot. I’m always wearing sweats when I travel, hoping they confuse me for someone famous. 
1 Right? Sweatpants, tshirt, hoodie, comfy shoes. Thats the way to fly.
1 A lot of airlines have dress code requirements.
1 The people in first class that are dressed the sloppiest are the richest ones.  They are rich enough to not give any fucks.
1 The first class double standard. Most people who fly first class fly enough to know that if you can wear flip flops through security you’ll do it and save yourself the hassle
1 No lies I just flew first class and I look pretty homeless. Proof before anyone bothers me  https://i.imgur.com/B1wlL5Z.jpg 
1 I love to travel - work/pleasure, flying/driving. But why can't we have some sort of dress code for flying? Like closed toes shoes/sandals. Pants/shorts made from cotton. Shirts that are weather appropriate. Also complimentary deodorant and mints. Last flight was home from corporate office. Guy sitting next to me was fat, no 2 ways about it. He was spilling over, wearing a tanktop - it was cold that morning. Sweatpants. He took his shoes off during the flight - had socks on, but c'mon. He was also reading a book on his iPad w like size 72 font and eating a breakfast pizza. I felt I'll for the first hour, trying to mentally handle his odor, the pizza smell, and his arm hair rubbing on me. He had to be late-40s. Idc how much you paid for your ticket, have some self-respect 
1 I fly first class because I want to be comfortable. Dressing super nicely defeats the purpose. That being said, you can strike a reasonable balance between comfort and appearance, it just takes some dedication to find the right clothes.
1 Just flew first class to Europe and back. What did I wear both ways? Comfy pants, a nice t-shirt, and a hoodie. Why? Because I was going to lay my seat flat and sleep, and if you think I am going to do that in a pair of slacks and a polo shirt, I have news for you. That being said, unless I was flying for work that day, I can't think of a time, economy or business or first or otherwise, that I would wear my suit/work clothes on the plane. Hello wrinkles and chance for spilling drinks due to turbulence. 
1 I do that shit on purpose. I if i get first class seats i dont shave, dont do my hair, i put on a white beater shirt with pit stains, maybe it was in a load i forgot to check my pants so a pen exploded in the dryer on it, Some ratty ass sweats, NO boxers so its really uncomfortable for tight ass waspy bitches  "oh my god not only is he obviously homeless, i think i can see his dick.. Ill bet it smells like sour milk" The whole 9 yards. Then i sit in first class and laugh under my breath when people pass, like "look at this poor piece of shit right here"I think i got the idea from a comic, i dont remember who but It. Is. The. BEST. 
1 If I ever flew first class you bet I'd be in jeans and a t-shirt.Fuck wearing suits for any longer than I have to.
1 You get side I from white people anytime us black people do something that displays "wealth". I have had people ask if that's really my car and police stop to make sure its mine. Its just a tesla not a Ferrari. Growing up upper middle class as a black family you get used to the side eye. Some neighbors don't even speak. Some are afraid if I go jogging. Some are nice. It kinda transcends race people just hate seeing other affluent people. 
1 Right, if you have a long ass flight wear the most comfortable clothes you have. I had PJ pants a Bulls shirt with holes in it while drinking Japanese whiskey in business class. 
0 Can confirm people sloppily dressed in first class. Source: I am first class.
206 When you travel that much, you book your flights as tight as you can most of the time so you can just get home and get it the fuck over with. I also don't want to change in an airport bathroom. Plus the flight attendants always hang up your jacket so you're pretty comfy in just a shirt and slacks. 
19 I think your suit usually comes out of the flight a little less wrinkled if you wear it than if you fold it up and put it in your suitcase
7 Some people wear suits everywhere because they look like crap in casual clothing. Good suit can hide a weird looking body pretty well. I don't blame people for being a little self conscious. 
1 I use to make frequent same day and one night round trips with my job. I had to fly in a suit because I’d leave the airport and go straight into a meeting. Then usually straight back to the airport.  It wasn’t the most comfortable attire. 
1 I don’t know about everyone else, but I buy comfortable suits. I gave suit pants that are damn near sweatpants level of comfortable.
1 Good dress pants are comfy as hell though.
1 I travel in slacks and shirt, and wear the jacket if it's going to get crumpled in my carryon if that's all I have. I travel smart because you never know who you're going to meet. In a world where connections matter, and first impressions count. I choose to go smart in case I come across someone who could potentially help me land a job once I finish Uni. 
7 The TSA fast pass is often slower than regular at my airport, so many people have it.The real impressive way to fly is private. Zero security other than a guard at the gate that checks your ID, and they only need to check one. Plus they are way more comfortable than any public plane I have been on.
3 Is it possible to learn this power?Or are you just talking about TSA Pre-Check?
1 Clear. I love that service. Even if there are only like 5 ppl in line I'm passing them up just for the spite. 
6 Fucking thank you. All these people saying they are getting side-eyed and looks for being in first class, wtf? Y'all act like regular people can't get first class. I take first class for work (only cause my job pays for that shit) and regular ass people take it all the time. No one gives a shit who is taking it or not. After a while it really doesn't even matter tbh lol
5 Shiiieeetttt, I do my best work that way. 
-1 WRONG. 
2 Why would you take a limo over an uber black? 
0 Underrated how close in price a limo was to an airport cab or Uber. If it's getting expensed, fuck it take a limo as long as it meets the pricing guidelines of your company. 
0 Funnily enough I know. I just completed hiking the Appalachian Trail, and you get dirty as fuck. Imagine me booking with my points and lifetime Silver status (I've lost Diamond after 2 years off the road) and my dirty hiker ass gets an upgraded suite looking like a filthy hobo. 
1 The crescendo comes when I am at their house, balls deep in their daughter. Plot twist!
1 OK MR. PLANE FASHION POLICE TAKE ME TO FASHION JAIL
3 Nah..but who cares if it even happend..at least it started a conversation amiright? /s
1 SAD! Fake news!
1  please clap

1 Fabricated and queer
41 The best thing is flying out balls early and double fisting beers in front of a bunch of Hasidic Jews. The stares that they give you between headbanging are just wonderful.
5 Me passing down the aisle to coach with my huge carryon since airlines now charge $50 each way to check a bag:  * "Oops, sorry!"  * "Whoops, sorry about that!"  * "Coming through!"  * "Damn, that must've hurt!"  * "Uh oh, I'm sure the stewardess'll get you another one"  * "Oh my bad! Just tilt your head back and keep pressure on it..."
2 The important point is that they take your drink and throw it away right before take off, so you have to get on first so you have time to finish it. Then they give you another one when you're in the air.
1 Let 'em stare. They in economy
1 The real benefit is getting space in the overhead bin.  Having to check your carry on when you don't have checked bags is a pain in the ass.
1 Unless the business class seats are one level above te economy class, ofcourse. 
1 Priority boarding is a scam anyway. Airlines impose their own inefficiciety in order to sell priority boarding though. ISPs will do the same thing without NN.
-7 $15 whiskey though....shit even bud light is like $9 on some of these flights. Craziest shit ever was when I was 18 and flew on a German airline and they gave me beer, free just like you would get soda. 
0 first class doesn't usually fill up, tho, since there's 30% less peeps per row and they get a free checked bag or two.seriously if you ever fly first class best thing to do is just stroll up to the plane after everyone else has boarded and then ask for two mini bottles of jack and just down them during the safety presentation. 
7 Well yeah, the implication that they're first ones to leave existence is a nice perk.
9 That's not social anxiety that's just regular anxiety and for a good reason, you don't want to get fucked with no place to put your bag.  don't turn it into a personality disorder it's a legitimate concern in that situation.
35 Similar thing happened with Japanese-American Senator Daniel Inouye after he returned from WW2.Daniel Inouye: Returning to prejudiceEven a decorated soldier in uniform experienced racial prejudice back home.Interview outtakes from THE WAR:"Well, I was in Oakland getting ready to get on a ship for a boat ride back to Hawaii. I was in my uniform with three rows of ribbons and a captains bars on my shoulder, I must have looked pretty good. Like a big hero with a hook on my right hand, where it used to be. And so, I thought I'd just get a nice haircut so I'd look neat. I looked around Oakland, here was a barbershop. Three chairs. I remember that. All three empty. The barbers are just standing around, so I walked in. This one barber approached me and he looked at me and he said, 'Are you a Jap??' You know, that was a strange welcome. And I said,'I'm an American.' 'Well, I'm asking you, 'Are you a Jap??'' I said, 'My father was born in Japan, my mother is Japanese. I suppose that makes me one.' 'We don't cut Jap hair.' And I thought to myself, here I am in uniform. It should be obvious to him that I'm an American soldier, a captain at that. And that fellow very likely never went to war. And he's telling me we don't cut Jap hair. I was so tempted to strike him. But then I thought if I had done that, all the work that we had done would be for nil. So I just looked at him and I said, 'Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.' And I walked out."

73 I never understood this, fuck the front of the bus especially if it has doors in the back or the middle. Also fuck the front of the bus big-time if i'm traveling long distance and he's going to speed, the 8 first seats are always the ones who die in a collision.
12 There’s a killer movie on Netflix called Mudbound that deals with this exact scenario. Gets pretty fucking heavy. Well worth a watch. 
3 Does it? Perfect time for a link! 
1 There's a documentary called "Sunshine Hotel" about one of the last flophouses on the Bowery. In one part (couldn't find the clip online but the doc is streaming on Amazon) one of the guys that runs the front desk tells a harrowing story of his travels in the south when he was in the military. He got refused service because he was black and he raised a stink (yelled that he can fight for their country but can't eat in the restaurant). The restaurant calls the sheriff who promptly escorts the guy to the train station and forces him on. When the conductor comes by, he gives his ticket and the conductor punches it. But when the conductor passes by another black man, they get in an argument. The conductor picks up that other black guy and throws him off the train, probably killing him (they were passing over a bridge). This guy realizes that the sheriff had told the conductor about the trouble at the restaurant but that they couldn't touch him because he was military (don't want a federal investigation). So the conductor threw the other black guy as a warning not to fuck with them. You could tell he felt so much guilt, even decades later.
1 The GI bill initially was only applied to white veterans.  Some bullshit.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill#Racial_discrimination
2 Yeah. That bitch thinking a soldier was in first class was the only funny part. 
1 You should see how much respect Sailors get, it’s really depressing 
1 I think he was just saying he doesn't meet the weight requirements.
2 Does it happen everyday? If so why is this the only story I have heard about it? 
4 Currently in military, never killed anyone and I’m not on the other side of the world.But ok 🤷‍♂️

26 ...nigga what, why wouldn't we claim black rappers

0 Oh really now? And I bet you think slavery also a myth, and the confederate flag is a symbol of southern and isn't racist in anyway
0 You don't need to white knight dude
1 That's awesome. I haven't been on a plane in years.

9 That could be a great sub about craft brewing imo
1 I'm sure /u/lazy_niggard is a real expert on black people's experiences with racism.
-1 > people like her love the military Only if they're white soldiers. People like her couldn't give a shit if this guy was a MOH recipient.
-1 Please tell us more about racism and race relations, cuck.
29 Yeah and people threw food and spit on her as they brought her to her seat 
1 Right after she stepped in some dog poop and went "aww maaaaan!" 💩💩💩 
1 That gate agent? Bernie Sanders. 
1 Still better service than United
6 For sure.What *might have* happened is the lady asked if he was first class and he said yes and that's all.
1 Is this pronounced “one hundred percent dollars” or “one hundred dollars percent”?
12 I never understood why people do/did that. Like do we clap when a bus/cab/train driver bring us safely to our stop
1 This reminds me of the old 4chan text about the American guy who went on a trip to Europe and applauded everything
269 Did you know Albert Einstein was a firefighter during 9/11?
16 In flight entertainment was leaked episodes of Rick and Morty s4 bc he is a writer for the show too.
3 That’s bullshit, Einstein is dead and even if he were alive he would never fly so as not to risk the greatest mind being injured or killed in a plane crash. You couldn’t expect someone with an intellect like that to risk it knowing what they know, but seriously folks cmon! You know back in the day Einstein wouldn’t let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell, and plummeted 16ft through an announcer’s table.
1 Albert Einstein wasn't here to fly this plane so he sent me, \*knocks out professor\*
84 I once banged Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom
1 A clap of relief? Delta?
8 That beer's nameAlbert Einstein
2 No, that actually sounds like something I'd clap for. The bullshit is when someone says they expressed a political view in public and people began applauding them. That's just not a thing people do.
18 The Captain sampled the sound of her wailing for his SoundCloud album.
18 eh, people get embarrassed when people start singing happy birthday to them. Some folk just don't want all eyes on them unexpectedly. 
89 Winked at him and gave him keys to a brand new Wraith.
9 Nice username lol
2 Ofc he was, he was the pilot

2 Time to deliver a PIZZA BALL

38 Confirmed. Used to fly internationally every fifth day for a month. I wore my pajamas. Victoria's Secret pj's, pants and a collared button down, but nonetheless comfortable.
26 I love flying, I also like looking awesome whenever I step out of the apartment. To each their own. 
766 Fuck, I'd pay for first class if there was a backyard cookout
194 I think the dressing patterns of people change with income, but it's cyclical.Little/no money: Dress bummySome money/lots of money: Dress as well as you can afford to impress people around you. Stupid amounts of money: Dress bummy because you no longer have any need to impress anyone; you've met your goals and don't care about strangers' opinions. 
85 As someone who flys alot....no one gives a shit what you are wearing or doing, as long as you have clothes on. Flight attendants give everyone the side eye, cause they hate the job.
12 I can't stand people like that.why dress up? You're on a fucking plane. It's a mode of transport. You're not dining out with friends.If you've got somewhere to be after, sure, dress up, but who gives a shit about the other passengers?It's like someone who dresses up to go shopping. Why? You're there to shop, not make money.
6 I read that in the voice of White Guy Dave Chappelle news anchor
2 I like to think that *most* people aren't thinking something like that but I guess it depends on where you are and who's flying with you... When I have flown biz/1st class recently  I notice that there are more and more younger folks (like 20's and early 30's) than I have noticed in past years, not sure why that is. If anything I could imagine the old folks getting pissed about all the young whippersnappers in the front of the plane maybe. My one buddy I travel to Colorado with sometimes is a good example of the sloppy 1st class traveler for sure, wearing flip flops with socks and gym shorts with that ridiculous looking neck pillow he bought, definitely doesn't look like he belongs.
2 As far as I'm concerned, the only people who don't belong in first class are babies. I don't want my free booze and snack frenzy interrupted by poopy shit rats. 
2 I'm black and have flown first class looking borderline homeless and no one's ever bothered me. I for sure wouldn't be surprised if  anyone did bother me about it. 
2 Bullshit.
1 “This isn’t your living room. I don’t want to see you in your pajamas.”
0 Happens to me too - I'm not old enough to belong up there despite flying 25 weeks a year for work.
1 Kinda like the bitching that went on when Obama was photographed without his suit jacket on in the white house
1 How long have you read minds?
1 That doesn't make any sense to me. The whole point of first class is to get sloshed in comfort until you arrive. 
1 Jokes on you black bois I'm too poor to fly airlines with first class. 
1 im sure that happended ><
0 Person of Color? Really? Sooooo "colored people"? GTFO!
6 I occasionally pay for first class, but it's either when it's cheap or it's getting toward the end of the year and I need the premium qualifying dollars to make premium status (it's easy to get the miles or segments if you travel for work, but it's harder to get the dollar requirement). It's hard to get work to pay for it unless you're an executive or something.
2 As a big guy the Advent of "Middle Class" Economy plus has been the best thing ever. 
3 Eh. To a degree. I dress up(ish) for flying, because I don't get "random security checked" as often.
11 Your initial comment and then your conclusion contradict each other. 
46 That makes sense. I guess I've just never had a problem with changing in an airport bathroom or just making a stop at my hotel. For short flights i could see it not being worth the extra effort but sweatpants are unbeatable for long flights.
9 But then your pants smell like all the farts you have been spewing during the flight due to the pressure change, and everything is wrinkled from laying/sitting all flight.The pros don't outweigh the cons for me. 
4 If you work in business you're  in these clothes 8ish hours a day, so usually they're comfortable anyway.
1 It’s really, really common for people to go directly from the airport to their meeting.
7 They have special hanger sections for suits.  If you have it in one of those suit covers they can hang it at the front of the plane for you. 
3 I usually take it off and put it in one of those long suitcases for suits and then just fold it in half once so it fits in carry on and that usually doesnt wrinkle it too bad. My back is weirdly sweaty/warm for a person in decent shape, so I usually wrinkle the fuck out of my shirts in the back if I wear them.
1 > Some people wear suits everywhere because they look like crap in casual clothing.[Like NPH](http://i35.tinypic.com/rscz2s.jpg)
1 Pretty sure they're referring to the pre-check line, it's actually pretty simple to apply. 
2 Yep, most times it was about $5-10 more without the tip, but it was worth it. I lived in the hood back then so I got looks both ways.
2 Exactly. Checked in the Hilton in old Town Prague at 4 am after an overnight train. Girl at the front told me the only clean available room was the royal suite, which ran like 38,000 Czech krones, which is like 1600 I think, and she didn't think she could give me that. 5 minutes later the hotel manager came out in a suit, handed me his business card and told me dinner was on them and sorry for the confusion. My brother was asleep on the lobby couch lol.All said and done I paid $89 for almost 2 full days in that room. 
1 Ok Homer.
3 Aisle seats are for chumps and people with weak bladders. 
31 First class has free drinks playa. 
2 You don’t pay for drinks in first class lol. They’ll cut you off if you get too wasted though.
2 In lots of German Restaurants a pint of beer will be close to the price of water (had some where is was cheaper), but both were regularly cheaper than a pop.Also Belgium is looking at re-introducing table beer (<3%) to schools.
3 me irl
3 For some reason people like to co-opt mental disorders, it’s weird. You always hear people saying “I’m a bit OCD, I never throw clothes on the floor.” No, fuck off, you’re just super clean. And this guy doesn’t like to be left standing with his dick out in a full plane, like everyone else in the world. 
1 It's not really a concern because they would just check your bag then and throw it in the bottom like you should have in the first place 
0 I mean I do have mild social anxiety. Not like flow blown. Same with slight dyslexia. The only diagnosed conditioned I have would be ADHD but def at the point in my life where I realize everything isn't black and white, but tons of shades of grey. 
7 The "speech" he gave on that is classic
39 I mean I agree. The back of the bus can always be lit or quiet and secluded depending on who you're riding with and when. But in the historical/racial context, I see where they were coming from. 
13 Bc its just straight up disrespectful imo. I agree with what you’re saying but I dont think THAT was ever the problem 
2 did buses from the past had the door in the back or just a front door that people use to get in and out? serious question.
1 The back of the bus is usually where the vibrations from a bumpy roads are most felt. I have travelled in a few overnight in India and it's impossible to sleep.
1 That reminds me when I was in an airport getting ready to board. Some girl asked me what seating zone I'm in just so she can have the opportunity to remind me that she's flying first class. I replied "I'm happy you'll be sitting first class"She gave a confused look and asked "Why?""Because if the plane crashes you'll be first to die"
0 Because a lot of people don’t take to twitter or other social networks to broadcast things that happen in their every day life. 
1 Same, we’re just tools of America’s foreign interests. We leave the debates about where/who we fight to the people who were elected by the Americans.
39 You mean 90% of this sub? 🤣
15 You don’t speak for white people 
24 nobody claims BoB
0 supahot.gif
1 Yea I've seen the Apple Juice bit. But I was referring to people being racist themselves and not realizing it, as opposed to what happened in Hannibal's bit
8 Lol yeah right, how many times have you seen this happen?
0 >Everybody in line: Starts to clap lmaoFucking horseshit. Really man, pull it together.
1 You’re not missing out on anything tbh
1 Nartin luthers "i had a dream" comes on the tv
1 Yes.
7 That person deserves the claps since operating a bus is way more dangerous.
5 A lot more people are irrationally afraid of a plane crashing but not afraid of a bus/cab/train crashing.
1 I've cheered for a landing once in my life: after touching down at [Toncontín International Airport](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toncont%C3%ADn_International_Airport) in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. That Wikipedia article calls it the "second most dangerous airport in the world," which I can only assume means that some war-torn country has spray-painted a live minefield and called it a runway. That approach and touchdown was fucking INTENSE.
60 They call me fire cuz I beat Einstein like Mike Meyer
10 I heard he was filming a movie and actually cut his hand and kept acting
9 Did you know that Einstein's monologue about his dad in Fresh Prince was improvised?
5 Steve Buscemi was trained to sniff out dead bodies and got so depressed after finding so many that they started planting live bodies for him 
1 Wonder if he helped MOSSAD plant the charges or nah
0 The previous poster said he was a pilot. Albert Einstein was a pilot during 9/11
35 Man, you really are streets ahead. 
5 Well not me personally, but a guy I know. Him and her got in on WOOOOEEEEEE
2 And got the clap
1 Yea well I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
1 Can confirm.  I removed my birthday on Facebook because I don't want the fake yearly attention.  I don't even want virtual eyes on me.
1 That's why they wear camo
2 I’m picturing the Terran air unit from StarCraft. Is there another Wraith I should know about?
1 *guitar riff* SUP LADY GODIVA?
29 Basketball shorts and a hoodie is my flying attire.
10 I don't know a single person that flies frequently that enjoys flying though.
309 Hit that first bit of turbulence and charcoal starts flying everywhere.
55 One of my greatest regrets in life is not attending the bbq I was invited to when I was the token white guy when I lived in a street next to Crenshaw.
17 Only if everyone had to use the poor people's bathroom in the back cabin.
2 Shit man I don't attend enough backyard cookouts anymore. 
1 I'm sure Emirates airlines is on it. You can already take a shower, and get your own apartment with a bed and a big flat screen. 
1 Holy shit can we make this happen ? 
15 There's actually a lot of things that vary by class like this. The high class isn't worried about losing their money, the low class has no money to lose, and the middle class is scared shitless because they could lose all their money and fall to the lower class at any time.
52 There should be a 4th option for edgy imgur and reddit users which consists of wearing cargo shorts and tshirts with movie quotes while calling fashion gay and making fun of anyone who spends money on clothes 
102 Or me Dress however I wanna dress cause I couldn't care about what any mf gotta say. Bummy or what! 
20 Because people who like to dress up only do it to impress others?
2 You just described LA
44 Ill judge the fuck out of you for wearing open toed shoes/sandals on a flight. GTFO with that. edit: some of yall are [oblivious/gross/selfish heathens](https://www.google.com/search?q=gross+plane+feet&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mYW39PPXAhXFSyYKHamVCp0Q_AUICigB&biw=1329&bih=629)
11 Don't tell me what my experience was. I flew a lot, 45+ weeks a year for 5 years. I know a fucking look when I see one. 
2 Just like the OP can’t speak for every side eye that he receives on a plane (or so you say), you can’t speak for every POC’s experience flying. 
2 No, we must find something to be outraged about in all social situations.
1 You do get treated better dressing in business casual then a taco Bell stained hoodie. They know that business guys love to write letters, and bitch about service. 
1 Speaking for and defending complete strangers. 
0 I kind of agree but in areas where money congregates its nicer to be dressed up and by that I mean at least some nice shoes, jeans, and a button up. 
1 Since I started responding to headass commenters on reddit.
1 I never understood how on earth "colored people" is virulently racist but POC isnt. Its the exact same meaning. 
-2 Yeah I said it. I'm not black but I'm not white, so I use an all encompassing term that means EBC, Everyone But Crackers. 
2 Agree. I didn’t mean I get work to pay for it. Anywhere I’ve worked they only pay for business class on international flights or flights of 4 hours or more (which is rare). If I was in first class for work I’ve been bumped most likely.Business flights are usually coach but the miles get banked for personal use. 
50 Yeah most of my travel was domestic, so I would fly into a city, have meetings, depending on client stay a day or two, and then bounce. Sometimes to a new client, sometimes home depending on week. Some weeks it would be literally just fly in for a meeting and then fly home that day. Fucking hated that shit, as if we couldn't have teleconferenced to save us all some time and money, but face time is face time with a client and when they spend millions on a product they expect someone in person. Business road warrior is a terrible lifestyle, don't do it. 
2 I went with this when I moved here to be with the woman I wanted to marry.  I wore these ugly ass shorts and a baggy t-shirt because it was comfortable as hell.  I wanted to be all dressed up and shit but I was traveling for 25-26 hours halfway around the world having to take 3 flights and with layovers.  I was looking for comfort.
47 What the fuck happens to you on a plane? I literally have never heard of this plane farting problem. 
2 Yeah I know, I did it every week. Unless this was meant for someone else.
7 Wait for real? Even for coach? 
2 >My back is weirdly sweaty/warm for a person in decent shapeI know your pain.
2 The secret is those shirt stays that clip your shirt to your socks. They feel weird at first, but you get used to it.
1 At some airports you don't even have to apply, the last time I flew I didn't get it on the outbound leg of my flight (but my 2 year old did), but all 3 of us got it coming back.
2 Idk man if you're not getting up to go to the bathroom during the flight maybe you're not using your first class ticket right. I'm on board with the 7am whiskey though.
6 Mind blown damn bruh. I need to try first class one day. 
1 Only have to drink like 46 drinks to break even!
1 It depends on the manufacturer and how old are we talking, but mainly after the 80s the buses had 2 doors 
1 That's maybe a bus/road problem, never had that here, new buses and nice roads, the vibration and deep sounds actually make me feel sleepy
1 So...... no evidence is evidence now? 
2 Right. We. 
5 As a white dude, I can vibe on BoB.
4 I know.  Just reminded me of this bit because of how unabashedly racist people can be that you have to think they don't even realize they're being racist.Because as [Bill Burr states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmqMV-d2bV0) "real racism is quiet"
2 Like the video where the Berkeley students were talking about how black people cant find the dmv or can’t drive there or don’t know how to use the internet?
-8 [deleted]
0 Lol, that line may be horseshit but the rest seems genuine. It's not like your claim really means much as you weren't there, none of us were so all we have is this guys evidence
1 what if the bus crashes into a plane
5 And that live bodies name? Albert Einstein.-abraham lincoln
6 Well no not really, but you could imagine though, right?!

2 I have a fucked up looking leg muscle because I was in a bad accident as a kid, so I wear jeans or sweats.
1 With a small blanket in your bag, though. It gets chilly in there!
5 What’s frequently? I fly 10-15 times a year, I enjoy it. I’m freaking zooming through the sky, getting drunk, and watching movies. 
1 I hate it. Especially the turbulence.
140 That's why they would use a gas grill.  Problem solved. 
2 Sausages would also start flying everywhere. My kinda party 
1 That's called in-flight entertainment.
68 Seriously, man, I'm not trying to make you feel bad about your life choices, but...what were you thinking?
19 Crenshaw & Washington here.Unless you knew a few of them folks REAL well, you made the right move.
11 I'm gonna guess that you were invited because people genuinely wanted you to be there, not because you were a "token."
12 Definitely, the disposable income struggle is a middle class thing. When you only have $100 of your paycheck left after bills/necessities, you'll probably just use it to buy stuff that makes you happy.But if you have a job paying you a comfy amount and you have $1000 left over, now you are wondering if you should buy a car, invest, buy a house, etc. But you know if you go too hard you are going to be broke as fuck again, just this time you have a bigger house to cry alone in. 
3 You can hate on my cargo shorts all you want, I still need somewhere to put my weed and pipe.
1 “No ones gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since Nam” ~ *types this movie quote while wearing beach shorts and a DBZ shirt. *
16 name checks out
7 Preach church tabernacle!
2 You're in the little/no money group aren't you?
5 Mostly yes.
1 You acting like a white dude on a slightly racial post in here GTFO with that sensitive bullshit
46 Mmmmm I wear flip flops, b-ball shorts, and a hoodie up front. Fuck being hot on a plane. 
7 I did this to people around me on my latest flight from Australia to the UK, we were landing  in October people sandals and a sun dress is absolutely not weather appropriate for England at 7am. Also don't they get super cold on the plane like that for 12 hours? 
2 Seriously.  It’s not smart-especially if something bad happens and you have to evacuate.  A few years ago, i did an evacuation drill at the FAA headquarters and ever since then i wear closed toed shoes when i fly.
1 Considering that athletes foot is transmissible by air, yes, open toed is very disgusting. Air circulates constantly on airplanes, the foot fungus spores you're being covered in/breathing could be coming from anywhere. 
0 Why? Me and my hot ass feet are going open-toed if I want to. Or, sandals for flights that give you slippers.
16 Do you?..Im not doubting your experience, Im sure you've gotten the side eye. Im just saying maybe just maybe..it wasnt racism every single time.
1 [deleted]
1 You're right I can't. So I guess we can just go on and assume anytime some one does something shitty to someone else it means they are racist.
1 Yea I could see that I suppose. I mean just by general assumptions the guy coming in wearing nice clothes might put in more effort to write a letter or complaint than the guy whos half awake with doritos dust on him
1 yea
3 I guess I just don't give a shit.I'm not trying to impress strangers, just the people I work with.
1 It’s nothing more than playing a victim role to just assume internal monologues. 
1 Anyone who says it's different is an idiot.
1 Eat a dick ya racist fuck.
1 Oh interesting, I'll have to see if my company has a similar policy. I fly 5+ hour flights monthly.
14 I almost did directly out of college but decided to go with an offer for less money instead of a consultant firm for more. Luckily the consultant firms were very up front with how many hours I could expect to work not including travel (and it was 4 days of travel per week)... I did the math and figured out I'd be getting paid a lot less per hour worked.
4 > Business road warrior is a terrible lifestyle, don't do it.Different strokes, bro. I loved that life. Only came home once a month and often that was for reserve duty. Then again I would spend at least three or four days in town, usually a week between flights. 
4 It can actually be fun if you're single and your coworkers like to party, but yeah it's pretty rough if you have a family. Road warrior life is pretty much for people in their 30s.
1 >  face timeThere's an app for that!
1 consultant?
13 Pressure changes as you go up in altitude.  My body is just a pressurized fart machine ready to expend rank farts.  Air or farts in this case goes where there's low pressure...which is the cabin.
5 It's pretty common to get gas on a plane, but most people just hold it in because they aren't assholes
2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_flatus_expulsion
55 Nah, not for coach. In coach they just release some rats and tell you to catch your dinner. 
8 I don't wear a suit to work, so I'm only speaking to when I fly for weddings and funerals, but yes, in coach they will let you hang your jacket up front. I've probably done it 5 times. Once, and only once, I had a stewardess say no, and this guy in first class said, "Nah, there's room, make some room," and she did. Shout out to that guy.
4 I usually fly Alaska, but have no special status and they have let me hang things in the closet while flying coach. Not sure if good customer service or the rule.
2 They'll definitely do it for you in premium coach if there's room and you ask nicely
2 Whiskey neat, not too much extra water and I've got a pretty tight gasket downtown so I can hold it for the most part. That being said, most of my flights are 3 hours or less, so not much need. 
3 Emirates has free drinks in economy class.  Apart from champagne you can drink all you like. 
2 Most intercontinental flights have free drinks. 
2 Awwwww yeah, we're in the money now baby. 
1 what about the buses from Rosa Park years?
3 Yo soy Mexicano, pero I'm with ya!
3 don't fall off the edge of that flat earth
2 Ugh.Also white.Also vibe.
2 GREAT reference! I've noticed though, as well as the rest of Black America, it's getting louder and louder these days
1 >Lol, that line may be horseshit but the rest seems genuine.That's because you'll believe anything that fits your prefabricated narrative, which is apparently "whitey is evil". >this guys evidenceWhat evidence is that? A woman standing behind him in line?
2 then get that bus the fuck off the taxiway 
1 I like it a little little chilly actually.  Feels fresher that way.
7 It's not about the flying itself. It's the other people, all the security checks , all the bad seats, the bad food.I'd love flying if I had a private jet, but for what I can afford it's like taking a bad bus through the air. 
1 There are people who fly nearly a hundred times per year. Some of my colleagues fly at least once per week, sometimes more.
241 Taste the meat, not the heat
3 talk about fucking up.
2 More money, more problems.
4 I think we can find a place for you to stick your weed and pipe without needing cargo shorts.
2 Not really....
2 Lol, I’m definitely not white. I just like to look good for myself (partly why I spend entirely too much money on sneakers). It just irks me a bit when people say that.
34 Then why wear the hoodie.
5 Got stuck in Cleveland/Detroit once because of a snow storm. I will always travel with this exact outfit because of that one trip. Fuck work travel.
4 mah man
2 planes are freezing though
1 Replace hoodie with hockey sweater and I'm all in.Nothing better than traveling in a hockey sweater.
0 as long as you got on socks you're good, but if I see your bare feet then I'm judging you
-2 Y tho?
-4 I never said it was every time. FOH with your assumptions. 
2 Bruh, there are 52 weeks in a year. I didn't travel EVERY single week, just almost every single week. Exceptions were Thanksgiving and Xmas weeks, and occasionally a few more sprinkled in. 
1 I’m not assuming anything. You’re assuming that the op has ill intent or thinks everyone is racist instead of simply listening to their experiences. You can’t make the determination that every experience they had hasn’t been hostile or rude because of race. Realistically speaking, it’s very possible that most of them have been. It’s also possible that none have been. But it seems like caping for people that you haven’t personally interacted with based off of your biased assumptions. 
1 Some businesses also require business casual at the least if the employee is flying on their dime. 
1 Plz educate me more, Sperglord, King of the Subreddits. 
18 You would not believe how many weeks I crossed 80-100 BILLABLE hours, and that doesn't include travel and other admin BS. I'm glad I've left that job behind, I was turning into a fat drunk just to cope with how shitty I felt. 
3 I was single and we did party. But now I'm older and frankly sick of that toxic lifestyle. In the end you're just selling your time to the highest bidder, and I crave freedom from work and quality of life outside of work. If I want to get trashed with my friends, I'll do it at home or a local bar, not some lonely ass hotel bar after a 16 hour day. 
1 Yep. 
5 My airplane farts are plentiful and odorless.
2 You actually got food?
1 Fair point, cheers.
2 Never been on an intercontinental American airline that had free alcoholic drinks....
2 Honestly had no idea he was a flat-earther. I just like his music sometimes.
1 Definitely a byproduct of the Trump administration.  
4 That stuff used to bother me, but you learn how to deal with it when you fly a lot. Get TSA pre-check, it’s like $50 and lasts 5 years, check in as early as possible or shell out extra for better seats, eat before you fly if you want a good meal. 
1 Definitely, I’m just curious what people who don’t really fly think of as frequent. 
86 That's a clean burnin' Hell i tell ya what.

17 Easy to take off with a t shirt underneath. 
2 **LPT**Always bring a comfortable, zip up, oversized hoodie with you on a night time flight. You can flip it around backwards and cover your face with it. You will be much warmer then the refugee camp blanket provided to you, and won't be bothered by the lights in the cabin. 
25 because despite what some people would say...not everyone who is an asshole is racist...sometimes they are just assholes.
6 > ut the moment a person of color did it, "THEY DON'T BELONG HERE, TREAT FIRST CLASS WITH SOME DIGNITY, THIS ISN'T A BACKYARD COOKOUT" or some other internal monologue headass comment......sorry I assumed you thought everyone was racist.
1 I mean I guess i was assuming, but it was based of his comment of "unless you are a POC then everyone thinks..." that gave me the assumption that anyone that is an asshole to them is perceived as racist.Wait so after they say the statement above...I cant assume they think anyone who is an asshole to them is racist....but they can assume everyone is racist..because? reasons? lived experiences,"where you think anyone who is an asshole to you is doing it because of your race"?Why is it "very" possible that most those people are racist, and only "just" possible that none of them are? Also im sorry I dont think everyone who is an asshole is automatically a racist, and It also seems like your "caping"? for OP even though you dont personally interact with them based off your biased assumptions.Literally All i was saying is that, everyone who is an asshole to you in your life are not automatically racist. It amazes me that so many people have this victim complex like the world is out to get you..when literally (almost) no one gives a shit.
14 Congrats on getting out when you decided it was enough. Onward to better things!

2 Christ, I thought it was just me! I drank so much more when I was a road warrior rep. Even when I was home it was half a bottle of vodka just to get some sleep.
1 Dead ass considering making a jump into consulting but idk...everyone says its fun but the travel is a grind. 
1 That's why I said most :) I've flown with Delta, British, and Turkish and all had free booze.

14 However, there is frequent overlap with racism and asshole-ism.
3 Just because you think you aren't judging someone because of their race, doesn't mean you aren't judging someone because of their race.
0 As applied to when I got "the look".But keep on telling me how I should feel. I'm sure it'll go over well. In fact, head to your nearest hood and tell em to all get over slavery it was 100 years ago. Report back with your findings. 
3 I-N-I my friend.
1 Do you like making money but not having a home life? Then do it. If you value things outside of work more than work itself, I'd suggest a short stint or not at all. 
1 Ahh gotcha. Ive done United a bunch of times and they really didnt have much. Lufthansa the German one was pretty good though.

4 Nah nigga I’m an asshole just cuz
1 I'd say that's probably true
1 .....Just because you are being an entitled asshole...doesn't mean you are racist.
10 woah...you saying black people only live in the hood? Did I tell you to get over slavery? Did I say that racism is completely gone from todays world? Your telling me not to tell you how to feel, thats fine, but your also putting your own emotions and assumptions on these people giving you a dirty look. All Im saying is not everyone who gives you a dirty look is racist...again sometimes people are just assholes
1 Oh yeah, my family and I immigrated to the States on Lufthansa 😎

6 Bruh everyone just calming saying their views or opinions and you acting like a sensitive lil bitch. It could've been a racist side-eye for sure but the other dude said it could've also been them being an asshole.

2503 Source: https://youtu.be/jr6R5dQa8hY?t=21sGlad he wasn't seriously injured.
5476 Looks like he rolls over the bonnet of the car instead of flipping in the air?Either way everyone is lucky no one got hurt, and helmet cam means easy insurance claim. 
283 Somebody's in trouble
813 Just imagine the oh shit moment the driver had as this biker flips over his hood and sticks the landing 
201 I would love a third person view of this
1506 Can't hear the sound but it seemed like this dude was much cooler about being hit by a car than I would be.  I would have slammed that person's hood and cursed them with every bad word I have ever heard. 
81 CrazyAny update on the aftermath of all this?
128 Time to whoop some wholesale ass!! 
51 /r/dashcamgifs
37 That driver was about to hit those pedestrians too!
68 If I was in that car I would be certain I just angered a ninja and will die soon
62 Me: Mom im getting a bike.Mom: Youll die in an accidentMe: but im super carefull always.Mom: Its not you im worried about.Me:...
985 Green doesn't mean go, especially if you are a motorcyclist. Green means check all the fools have stopped. Then go. 
38 Saw something like this happen, wasn't the motorcyclist's fault though. A cop ran the light without his sirens on and the cyclist couldn't stop in time. Flipped over the hood just like this and landed on his ass about 15 feet from me. Immediately got up and started yelling at the cop. It was partly awesome but mostly terrifying. I thought that dude was gonna die. 
15 This unfortunately is not a good outcome. Almost the identical thing happened to me 20 years ago while riding a motorbike. At the time I felt like a ninja. However the impact did something to my upper thigh muscle on the right side and it pains me every single day. At first I thought it injured the bone but I've had multiple X-rays on it and no micro fracture shows. It appears the muscle got severely and permanently injured. I do yoga and stretches on it every day for years, I have good and bad days. It sometimes gets so bad I have trouble sleeping. If OP posted this don't think because you feel fine you will be ok forever. Start working on the muscles now. I wish I could figure out a solution for it
12 /r/watchpeoplesurvive this guy was really lucky 
38 Imagine the fear that driver is feeling. "Oh, fuck I just hit Jason Bourne."
32 Wow they REALLY ran that light it was red for like 5 sec
8 ACROBATICS 100
9 Something similar happened to my dad when he was younger. It was just after my sister was born but before I came along. Apparently he hit the back of a car much faster, somersaulted over the entire car then landed on the side, running down the road from the momentum.When he got home, he hung up his helmet, decided to sell his bike, and never rode again.
8 If he didn’t get hit, those pedestrians on the right very well may have been.
5 He seems surprisingly calm after. I would be removing the persons side view mirrors for them, maybe putting some speed holes in their tires. Perhaps create a cool spiderweb design on all their windows..
5 I really hope:1. He yelled TADA!2. If I ever get hit, I'm as lucky as this!
10 If he flipped in the air and landed it you believe that driver was ready to get his ass beat
6 Something similar happened to me this summer in which I got hit on my bicycle heading home from work at the beach. I landed on my arm (it fractured) but I jumped right back up and the first thing I did was look for my bike. Can totally relate to the end to his panicked search for the damages!
5 Tale that dumb ass out of that car and put them in prison for 10 years. There is literally zero excuse for running a red light. This could easily have resulted in a death.
4 He must be part cat
4 The punishment for running red lights needs to be greatly increased. It needs to be more than a ticket or just a little jail time
3 So he saved those pedestrians lives..
4 Holy shit that motorcyclist saved those pedestrians!
5 What a fucking moron that driver is, if it wasn't for that guy on the motorcycle, they probably would have ran over that pedestrian totally unaware talking on her phone.
4 If the motorcyclist wasn't there the driver would of hit 2 pedestrians crossing the road too. Glad to know there wasn't a serious injury
4 This shit fucking infuriates me.  It's like drivers act like their vehicles aren't more lethal than fucking guns.  Fucking irresponsible.
8 Motorcycle Ninja here - yeah I'm the one who got hit in this gif, created a throw away to answer any questions.  Please go watch the video and click on the ad on youtube so I can get that internet money. Link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr6R5dQa8hY 
3 Spiderman. 
3 As bad as it is for the motorcyclist, he lived and didn't seem that injured. If he hadn't been there, that car would have run over those pedestrians crossing the road and killed them.
3 "Leaked footage of new PUBG map"
2 He very likely saved those pedestrians crossing on the right if the screen.
2 Notice pedestrians starting to cross the street also. Guy in the car is an asshat
3 Hence why I always pause for a moment when the light turns green and look both ways. Never assume drivers will do what you expect them to do. Especially in the world of smart phones and touch screen monitors in cars.
3 /u/stabbot
3 I didnt know alvin kamara rode a motorcycle 
3 Saved the 2 pedestrians as well.
3 Now days, green light doesn’t mean GO. It means wait until all the drivers who is running the red are gone, then proceed with caution. 
14 [From another angle](https://youtu.be/K4Szowla9mQ?t=8)
3 You should always look both ways and don’t trust people. Someone is bound to run one eventually. Glad he was okay. Edit: also not blaming the motorcycle driver at all. 
2 Reminds me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17ig4WziQzM
2 Either way he's like wtf how
2 The biker should’ve nut the cunt.
2 The VW Driver must've shit their pants after realizing they hit some kind of super hero
2 [/killthecameraman](https://www.reddit.com/r/killthecameraman/) almost literally 
2 This dude would’ve hit those pedestrians if he hadn’t hit the biker.... damn....
2 Looks like he saved the people from getting hit in the crosswalk. He sacrificed his bike to save them :)
2 That was a REALLY, REALLY red light 
2 ITT - people assuming the motorcyclist didn't get hurt.
2 I swear he flipped the bird to the other driver mid flip
2 That's why at greens I always pause a little bit and look at my surroundings instead of just gunning it. 
2 Pedestrians started walking at the green light too. This guy might’ve saved their lives.
2 The gif froze to buffer for me at the exact moment the screen blurred on impact."...you might be wondering how I got here..."
2 The loop tricked me. I thought he got back on the motorcycle, and got hit a second time.
2 I can kind of make an assumption what happenedThe car who hit the motorcycle was behind the car taking a right. They must have got fed up, "damn car slowing me down once they are out the way oim still taking the light." After the car is out of the way you see the car speed past hitting the motorist.
2 This is why I can't bring myself to get a motorcycle, as much as I want one.I know I'd be a safe rider, but all it takes is one idiot like this and you can be done. Obviously this guy got extremely lucky, a simple crash like this could easily cause lasting physical damage.
2 Ya so, rule number 507 never blast out when it turns green, wait a few seconds. Those cars with cages can wait a few for safety. Some would say the hwy is the most dangerous, it's the intersections. 
2 i bet his knees are gonna be aching.
2 I had to rewatch it several times until I understood that it was his helmet in the lower part of video and not a motorcycle handlebars.
2 He's a lucky guy! 
2 Lucky 
2 I saw that coming. Saw so many drivers of cars
2 That's why I wait a second before going, I don't trust people.
2 Love the fact he flips and lands staring straight at the culprits car.
2 in USA you only get fined for running a red light, right? (assuming you didnt crash into something)in sweden they instantly take your license, for good reason.
2 It looks like if the person on the bike wasn't hit the pedestrians may have been hit instead.
2 Am I the only one who watches carefully as I go through intersections because I don't trust anyone else to drive correctly?  This guy has so much time to stop before hitting the car...
3 And this is why you don't go as soon as the light turns green. Sometimes brakes fail sometimes people are pay attention and sometimes an asshole is just trying to run the red light. Disclaimer: I am in no way implying the biker was in the wrong. 
4 Damn didn't even check to see if the intersection was clear.  You only make that mistake once.
2 Newbie rider.
2 This is why you check an intersection even if you have the green light. No guarantee someone is going to not run a red light.
2 Fuck. That. Car.  I ride everyday and this is my consistent fear. Stoked ol' mate is fine! 
2 Obviously the car is at fault here. But this is a prime example of why you should still always pay attention and look both ways, even when you have the green light. Especially when you're a vulnerable target.
1 Superstar!
1 nonononoNO!
1 These are the risks of riding motorcycles. Accidents regardless of fault can hurt way more. For reasons of course. 
1 Calculated.
1 9.67 - didn't fully stick landing
1 So has he dedicated his life to fighting crime yet? The world needs you motorcycle dude.
1 He seems more concerned about his bike than himself
1 Nice try, deadpool.
1 DO A BARREL ROLL!
1 He is a cat.
1 I feel like there's something so cool you can do after landing on your feet, but I can't think of it. 
1 "FUCK YES! Let's do it again!"The biker probably 
1 I think the halo saved him
1 Looks like the guy hit a car and lost his pants. 
1 Almost the exact opposite happened. Normally red light for me was green. Slowed down just slightly to look at a sign, and a Harley blows thru on red. Don't run red lights. There could be a much bigger vehicle about to ruin your life, and he's legally protected 
1 People tell me I drive like a grandma because I make sure there isn’t a semi blowing through the intersection before I put our lives out there.
1 WTF, that was lucky! Definitely could have ended worse, I hope he didn't injure himself much.
1 That's almost as great as a russian crash video I saw where a cyclist hit (or was hit) by a car, flipped, and landed on his feet on the roof of the moving vehicle he hit/that hit him.
1 “I’m here to eat ass”
1 Bro, sit a moment, you deserve a moment, and you need to let the adrenaline burn off. 
1 I have a much less badass version of this. Same scenario, but on a moped and with no helmet. O yea, and I landed on my back and spent the day in the hospital. Fun times. 
1 Looks to me as if it’s possible he was trying to race the other bike next to him and didn’t look for traffic.  Still... that red light runner is an asshole.
1 People these days 
1 ohhhhhhfuckWEEEEEEEEEEEE!Awww neat!Fuck, my bike! 
1 nonononoyesno
1 I can imagine him landing and just looking at the driver dead in the eyes
1 The exact reason I gave up riding. So many dumb fuck drivers out there who don’t understand what a red signal means 
1 Every dashcam or goPro video I see where a motorcyclist gets hurt, its ALWAYS a Volkswagen's fault. Even in real life every bad driver I come across is always in a Volkswagen...Lousy cars for lousy drivers
1 When GTA logic comes to life
1 I was snowboarding Sunday and I took a fall bounced off my shoulder and landed on my board doing a full flip/somersault kinda similar thought it was funny 
1 Hey, you can see the moon!
1 Crazy ass!!! I’m surprised that thing is still recording lol 
1 I gotta get a dash cam
1 I want to see what happens next
1 If you look carefully on the right there is 2 people crossing the road unaware of the car,  he could have just saved their lives
1 And this is why I'm never the 1st through an intersection when riding a bike.I recently moved back to the city from a more rural area and have to deal with red light runners, gutter snipers and people who close the gap when you signal a turn and other city driving 'habits' people have. Sheesh
1 This is exactly what I would do and I recommend you do the same.  I am always surprised when people don't flip and land on their feet when they get hit by a car or truck or whatever.  It's so obvious.
1 I won't even get on a motorcycle.  I honestly don't think it's if, but when.  And when it happens, you're gonna get fucked no matter what.  I can live with dying, but I don't tjink I can live with a major handicap.  
1 I hope such people lose their licence for the rest of their disgusting life.
1 that guy better get a hefty fine. i HATE people who beat the red light.
1 I had a guy turn left across traffic in front of me as I was doing 45mph. I hit his rear tire and flipped over the car along with the bike. Luckily, I was traveling home for the weekend from school and had a backpack full of clothes. I somersaulted and landed on my back. Besides a bruised coccyx and scraped shin I was fine. I jumped right up and was able to see the guy stop then drive away. People gathered around and one woman was hysterically shouting "The motorcycle landed on him!". It had not. The cops found the guy and I got $50/mo for a few years. I saved them all up and signed them at once to deposit. My hand was tired.
1 Thinking about it, if the car didn't hit the motorcycle it would've hit the pedestrians. 
1 Conceivable that the biker saved the pedestrians on his right. glad things worked out the way it did. 
1 Ottawa Ontario. Worst drivers in Canada 
1 That's amazing
1 This almost happened to me last night except i was in a truck and some stupid girl ran a red light in her orange toyota brz. Idiot...shes lucky i know how to swerve last second. Too many idiots on the road. 
1 Ohh he is gonna feel that
1 Motorcyclist clearly not at fault, but this is a prime example of why you should never trust a green light.  Always look both ways before crossing the street.
1 That VW was hard ass, didn't dent at all
1 This is exactly why we don't floor it to try and take pole position on the greenEDIT: I should NOT floor my replies ;)
1 He was so calm... wonder what happened next.
1 Additional footage directly after the accident:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce8siKnO3V0
1 r/gifsthatendtoosoon
1 Is that you spiderman?
1 "baby are you a cat??'cause you've got 9 lives and you always land on your feet!" 
1 The way you see his feet flying around there at the end of his legs, it's madness.
1 Not sure how accurate this is, but from the looks of it, if the biker wasn't the one to get hit, the pedestrians off to his right in the crosswalk would probably have been the ones to get hit. That would have been much worse.
1 That's what happens when you run over a Power Ranger.
1 AJIN!
1 He honestly might’ve saved those pedestrians from injury. They would’ve walked right in front of that car 
1 This is a repost of one of the top posts all time in this sub. You couldn't have even come up with a different title?https://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/comments/5p4rt3/motorcyclist_gets_hit_by_a_car_running_a_red/
1 joys of the motorcycle, being able to flip through the air
1 You can't fool me, this is Peter Parker flipping over the car in Spider-Man 2. Red helmet and everything. https://youtu.be/K4Szowla9mQ
1 This reminds me of the old GTAs
1 lowkey viral volkswagen commercial to show how good they are with pedestrian saftey
1 I look both ways before crossing an intersection in my car, the fact he didn’t on his motorbike is something that should be mentioned
1 Hope hes doing ok, that looked really nasty,...
1 If you look on the right side, there are two pedestrians that could have been hit as well. Come on drivers!
1 Him getting hit could have saved 3 lives look at the people crossing on the right.
1 He might have saved those pedestrians on the right hand side from being hit, at least. 
1 leaked footage from Hardcore Henry 2. 
1 Whats crazy is he actually saved those pedestrians on the right from being hit, you can see them walking before he starts going forward... They would of been seriously injured or dead.
1 Commence ass beatatry
1 And there was pedestrians crossing too, that could've gone much worse 
1 Thanks, DMV. You really do keep us safe. /s
1 Anyone know the aftermath? Did the driver get his license revoke or 
1 His helmet is the same color as his bike so I thought his bike flipped with him. 
1 Repost alert: [Motorcyclist gets hit by a car running a red light, flips in the air, and lands on his feet](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/comments/5p4rt3/motorcyclist_gets_hit_by_a_car_running_a_red/)
1 I would've been like ::lands on feet:: "ok it's time to bust yo' ass !!"lol but instead he just looked at his feet when he landed lol
1 This new *Black Panther* footage is legit
1 Whelp, I'm glad he did check to make sure his shoes were intact. Death avoided!
1 I just watched the video like 10 times, he was so lucky 
1 Is it bad if this was no no yes no no for me?I wanted justice.
1 Always give it a hard 3 count.  I just can't trust cage dwellers. 
1 Another glitch in the matrix. 
1 r/unexpected
1 It actually looks like he rolled on the cars' hood, not flipped through the air.
1 And this is why I don't ride a motorcycle anymore. 
1 The light turned green at an intersection I used to live by. Two taxis drove through and a truck ran a red because its breaks failed. Resulted in at least 25+ dead. Moral of the story is. Green is just a suggestion. Always look left and right regardless. Here is some dashcam footage. Warning disturbing https://youtu.be/hAd_0MQ6Qs8
1 It's not uncommon for motorcyclists to break their legs in an accident just because of this sort of ejection from their bikes.
1 I’d hate for that to happen to me. 
1 that's a tough hit 
1 why is this on nonononoyes? wheres the yes part?
1 [deleted]
1 What is the penalty on running a red light? 
1 I kept thinking the helmet was some kind of wierd handlebars that got ripped off the bike and he was just holding them stunned
1 Does the car run over a red light?
1 I could practically feel the impact while watching this.
1 This wouldn’t have happened if he followed the green light instructions
1 Its like that scene from spiderman. This guy is spiderman, CASE CLOSED!
1 He's a super hero now  
1 *checks to see if still wearing shoes* I'm alive!
1 That rider's situational awareness was a bit low.
1 I love how, without fail, every single post about a motorcyclist being hit. The conversation always ends up being about why it's the motorcyclists fault. Even when it blatantly isn't. 
1 "Holy Fuck!  Are my shoes still on?!"*looks down*"Yep, I'm alive."
1 I wanted to see him walk over to the car, kick the window in, drag the driver out, and beat them to a pulp. Of course, that would be "bad".
1 I can understand creeping through a red light at midnight cause no ones there, but a busy street in the middle of a city? Who the hell does that???
1 Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
1 [Here's what the aftermath looked like](http://imgur.com/pYfB5sT) 
-1 Only enter an intersection when it's safe to do so..... guy on the bike didn't do that.
-4 that guy isn't safe riding, didn't saw the car or if he did his reaction time was terrible.  riding with eyes like this is suicide
-53 Green means it's legal to go, not necessarily safe. Just make sure you've had the best look you can at the time.
-2 He could have easily stopped before he was in the cars path
-7 Not to victim blame, but the motorcyclist entered the intersection way too fucking fast for his own good. Accelerating so hard just makes you unpredictable to other drivers, especially when you are at the front of line of traffic and the light has just changed. Other drivers are trying to make the tail-end of their yellow lights, which is why you should always proceed carefully when a light first changes, NOT floor it into the intersection.
-8 Not the first time and won't be the last I see a motorcyclist race ahead as soon as the light turns and end up getting hit.  Would it kill these Darwin Award Winners to maybe wait a few seconds before flying into the intersection to make sure it is totally clear? I know I know they have every right to speed ahead as soon as the light changes and the car driver is completely wrong but how is gaining a few seconds close to worth this? Every motorcyclist that rides like this is a Darwin Award Winner (hopefully) weeding themselves themselves out of the gene pool.  
0 one thing I was taught is don't be in a hurry to enter an intersection, or don't be the first one in. let the other drivers take the risk
0 That’s why you always look both ways and wait at least two seconds before you go.
0 Green doesn’t mean it’s safe to go. Green means you have the right of way. I’m not going to risk my life by being complacent and relying on people doing what they are supposed to.
0 How the hell does the green gets on so soon after the red went off. As an Italian, TIL out streets are throttled... Wonder why tho... /s
0 Whatever keeps the motorcycles off the street... 
-34 [deleted]
-11 Ah yes, a clueless motorcycle rider who doesn't assess the situation.How about looking both ways before entering an intersection?
-2 And this is why you don't trust little colored lights with your life.  Use your eyes sheople!
-3 Obviously it's the car driver's fault, but that is some shitty motorcycle riding.
-3 Even I saw the car and you failed to stop, pay attention and always assume other drivers are airheads.  Both are at fault.
-1 This is why you wait a second before going at Green.You can be the best driver, you can have the right of way; doesn't mean some dumbass on the road won't blow a red light.
-1 In America he would be partially responsible for not paying attention. This looks like America. He's partially responsible. 
-1 Further proof that all non chopper riders are idiots. #NoSympathy
-1 It looks like he went full "cycle". 
-1 Was he riding a Ninja?
-8 The law states: You can proceed when a light turns green, AFTER the coast is clear. That law is created for a good reason. Both are at fault.
-2 Why isn't this in slow motion?
-5 The only suitable punishment for that driver.....is death. I'm not sure how that guy isnt pulling the driver out and beating them. I know I would be. 
70 The DVLA (think British DMV) actually calls it an 'unscheduled dismount'. My last one was so unscheduled I broke my shoulder. 
24 Looks like he stuck the landing, too.
2 Ooo ooo I've got this. How about straight into the back of a stopped car with a tumble over the bars and a 180 off the trunk to a standing position.Seriously though always wear a helmet. I walked away without injuries because of my helmet. 
1 Oh man, I wish I had a helmet cam because I would have a superb entry for this.
-1 can i just get street luge back?
2544 “Pull over”“What the fuck do you mean pull over, my bike is over there” 
296 Dude doesn't even make a sound. It's like it's a casual thing for him.
127 What's a cager?Is it like a term bikers use for people who drive cars because they sit in a Roll cage?
88 damn.. did the driver bail too?? i don't see the car after he gets to the sidewalk :(
32 oh good. I thought his head fell off and landed on the roof of another car
91 As a formet biker, it's never wise to speed off at the sign of a green without a traffic check. Same goes for drivers: give it a second before you go.
24 would the motorbike rider have to pay for the ambulance in US?just wondering why he's declining it.
6 This guy is super tall
9 Holy shit give the man some air lol like 20 people came to him 
2 Looks like he saved the pedestrians... the people crossing on the right would have been crushed 
2 Wow not only was he mostly okay l, there was a nurse in the vicinity to make sure! What are the odds?
2 This is why people should fucking stop at a red light it’s not fucking rocket science

2 PLEASE CLICK THE AD!  I get internet money for every click.
1 Is cager motorcycle talk for 4 wheel car driver?
1 This is so fake.  You can see his stunt double at the 1:00 min mark.Before I get down voted to hell.  I'm joking.
1 That little exclamation of “woah” just before he gets hit makes me chuckle.
1 WTF, did the driver just leave?
1 At [0:53](https://youtu.be/jr6R5dQa8hY?t=53s), is that guy in the slacks not wearing any shoes or is it just me?
1 The comments on the video claiming the motorcyclist was partially at fault are weird. In the video, I certainly couldn't see the car in time due to the turning car being in the way. Also, one doesn't usually expect someone to blow their red light, and the car driver was certainly at an advantage to see traffic was coming from the sides. Sometimes you can tell that someone is about to do it, but not always. Lots of victim blaming going on there. People generally aren't stupid enough to play chicken against a car with a motorcycle. 
1 I would have John Cena summer slammed that fucking guy in the car to the ground
1 In the description he says "ATGATT likely saved me from severe injuries or death", is he talking about  his genetics?  or does ATGATT mean something in biker terms?
-1 Fucking bystanders. Like seriously, even the mom with the young girl? 
-39 I'm indifferent
337 He's not necessarily unhurt. He could very well still have broken bones.
1545 I think you're right. It looks like there is a butt sized dent in the hood when he comes around
96 Someone once told me that green light doesn't mean it's safe to go. It means that it's legal to go. Put things in perspective for me.
171 Doesn't mean he didn't break something or hurt him in some ways.Source- was in a car accident and was fine the day of.... a few months later developed the worst pain and have it to this day
43 How much leniency does one get for assaulting the driver in a situation like this? For you-almost-killed-me-for-nothing rage?
12 You're right. I was actually there, about a half a block away, when this happened in downtown SF a few years ago. The guy was mostly fine afterward but had a little bit of a limp. A bunch of people made statements on his behalf.
7 Can confirm. Used the scroll mode on the Apollo  app and he just slid on the hood.
2 Exactly why I run a camera too. Hopefully can at least get a plate number if not more. 
2 I definitely went air born and landed back on the windscreen, booting me into the crosswalk.  Source = I was the one who got hit.
1 The driver is lucky he wasn't beaten to death. 
1 It definitely sounded like his helmet hit the car. 
1 Let's pretend the car that hit him didn't have insurance. Could his insurance use the helmet cam footage to claim that even though the car ran the red it was an avoidable collision and they will not pay out?
1 I been hit by a car like this with out the bike... It still hurts and takes a bit of time to heal. I don't think that the rider is OK. Just no snapped femors and what not. Very well could have broken bones or internal problems 
1 All around lucky break for everybody. Except the idiot in the car. 
1 Those people on the right in the crosswalk are lucky the car hit this guy first, otherwise it might have just plowed through them. 
1 Nah man the guy on the bike was very unlucky. Could have not been in an accident 
1  Physics in accidents are weird.  I was in a car accident once and I wasn't wearing my seatbelt.  The car was sliding and rotating to the left as it hit the utility pole so it was a sideways impact combined with rotation.  And because I wasn't wearing a seatbelt my body was tossed to the left and up.  I blacked out right as the impact happened and awoke a fraction of a second later to glimpse my legs and feet falling back on the floor.  No, they weren't detached, but the impact was so violent it tossed my legs up in the air above me.  Now, I am a large person, I don't bend that way even after an hour of stretching.  So I was left with an incredible amount of pain and stiffness from my body being bent in a way that it was not used to.  Also... one of my shoes came off and was tossed 25 yards down the street by the impact.  Always wear seat belts kids!!!
1 A dashcam is the best $50 to $100 you could spend on a car. Saves you from hundreds of hours of he said she said and lawyer bullshit when a stupid driver hits you. 
1 Watch it again - I made contact with the car's windshield, got launched into the air, flipping around, then hit the car again when I came down which propelled me into the cross walk.
1 Bonnet? Shit, redcoats are here! Skatter, y'all!
1 No one else is going to comment about how adorably Mary Poppins it sounds that (presumably British) people call part of the car the bonnet?
0 The fuck is a bonnet 
-4 lol "Bonnet." 
-3 "bonnet" So cute how you guys talk over there. Like little children.
342 I knew a guy that was first in line at a red. When the light turned green he moved into the intersection and was hit by another car. He was cited for causing the accident because he "entered an unsafe intersection". I don't think that would be the case with this crash, but the moral of the story is, a green light is merely a suggestion that the intersection is safe. 
666 fuck i accidentally hit a ninja
55 Right? “I shouldn’t have ran this fucking Red light to save 3 minutes and almost kill someone because I thought my day was more important”. Probably what he thought 
24 "Oh jesus christ i hit a terminator" 
41 And a new extreme sport is made. Or worse, a new "challenge" trend
3 Imagine the oh shit moment I had when I saw this guy blasting through the intersection heading straight towards me...
1 *The agent is alive! Mission failed. retreat, retreat!*
1 [I imagine something like this ](https://giphy.com/gifs/category-taunt-hulking-pK1xYb8ftQZdm) 
1 Oh shit, now I can't drive away and pretend not to notice I just hit this guy.
1 "Come at the king, you best not miss!" 
152 In my view, the car is guilty.
2 Apparently the cab that was turning right had a dashcam that caught it but I never got a copy of the footage.  I could always see if the police still have it via a FOIA.
2 [Looks something like this](https://youtu.be/3NoCBPh_hS4)
2 Third person responding here.  Can confirm, car's fault.
1368 *slams hood*GOSH DARN IT!!!YOU HIT ME WITH YOUR CAR SILLY RABBIT!!!
99 the gif cuts off pretty early. i'd wager he was still in shock. plenty of time to still go do that.
35 You say that but if you’d done a successful flip you’d need some time to take it in.
16 I think the video stops as that's happening. His first reflex is wiggling the fingers and toes and finding his bike. Then the helmet cam goes to the driver and the gif starts over. That's the yelling and screaming and smashing of hoods.
12 Mooother TRUCKER dude that hurt like a BUTT CHEEK on a STICK
24 I doubt I would be able to say anything for a second after nearly dying, but I also don't go around looking for people to rage at.
4 I actually got hit by a car (no serious injuries) and my reaction was to get off the hood and walk away.
3 It was shock.  I couldn't understand at first what happened to me, that's why I looked down at my feet first in disbelief.  When I raised my arm to shout at the guy I quickly realized my body wasn't alright and headed for the sidewalk.
3 Ow, fuck
3 I mean, new bike, amirite?
2 Not enough info and/or shock. Dude could have gone full on psycho for all we know, or under difference circumstances.
2 I would have went full on Zach Braff
2 Psh that is nothing.  I would have SMASHED that person's hood and cursed them with every REALLY bad word I have ever heard TWICE.
2 I think its more like "oh hey I'm not a severed head, awesome."
2 Forsure. 
2 > Huh. So *that's* why they call me the Cat Man.-Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth
2 Slammed the hood? Dude i take off the helmet and start bashing the goddamn windshield and probably his face.
2 Oh shit we got a tough guy. 
1 Their hood and not their jaw? 
1 Having had the unfortunate experience of getting into scooter crashes (3, one of them entirely my fault, one of them i was a passenger and the last one my front tubeless tire deflated explosively) you don't get angry or pissed after the impact, you understand what happened, check yourself for injuries and then slowly the realization that you were wronged sets in and starts ramping up your emotions. 
1 Funny thing about shock and adrenaline... It doesn't make you necessarily act how you think you would act whilst sat safely behind your keyboard on reddit. 
360 From the youtube link description:This happened to me on 1/28/2015 as I left my parking garage to head home from work in downtown San Francisco at the intersection of Ellis St at Cyril Magnin St.  I had just turned my helmet camera on (Contour ROAM) which is the starting point of this video.  The driver of the car clearly blows his red light and hits me in the intersection at least 5-6 seconds after his light had turned red (including the 2 second delay between light changes).  My heavily customized 2011 Daytona 675 was destroyed in an instant but I managed to land on my feet after getting launched into the air by his windscreen.  ATGATT likely saved me from severe injuries or death, as I was able to walk away with bumps and bruises primarily.  Currently it appears that I may have some tissue damage in my left knee. I'm in the process of determining and identifying the source of the pain I'm having with my doctors.  The driver stopped after the accident and we exchanged information.
2 What do you want to know?  I upgraded to a Daytona 675R after this accident.
2 Hard to do that when you just got smashed by a multiple thousand pound object traveling 35mph.  Ask me how I know.
14 I said the same thing, it sucks, but hitting that bike really saved those pedestrians who would have gotten really hurt! 
3 Good point. I have avoided multiple accidents by slamming brake (in car and on bycicle) where it would be their fault. If collision had to happen the other party would only hit brakes after the potential crash. Also just to point out that in the car mistakes are usually minor hazard where as on the bike every drivers mistake is potentially lethal.  
1 That's what my parents used to say about my driving when I was younger."It's not you, it's them!"
1 This is so true - you can only control you.
-1 That was a 100% rider preventable crash. You always look for that. I missed a suburban from hitting me in just this same kind of situation, only a couple of months ago. 
-5 Why does his mother say he'll die in an accident if he's not the one she's worried about. If she's not worried about him then why does she say that he'll die in an accident. Is she threatening him? All in all the plot of this post seems a bit contrived and unbelievable. There's humor here, to be sure, but the legs on which that humor stands are shaky at best. After careful consideration I would give this post a 6/10. I did enjoy it and I'm glad I saw it on Reddit, but would recommend to anyone asking me about it to just wait until it's reposted on Facebook. 
474 You shouldn't be being downvoted for this, it is good advice.Doesn't make the motorcyclist in this instance in any way responsible for what happened to him, but it's always good to remember just because you have a green light that you still need to check for morons.EDIT: for context, when I replied to the above comment it was on minus 1.
42 Reminds me of something I read on Reddit once. I can’t remember the exact quote, but I believe this is pretty close:“A green light doesn’t mean it’s safe to go. It just means it’s legal to.”
13 I drive a car and do the same thing at each stop light. It became muscle memory after riding a bicycle in Bucharest for 3 years (before buying the car). Saved my ass a few times
9 Exactly. Always assume other people aren't paying attention. Better to be alive than right. 
8 While I normally agree with you, it was safe to go when he went.  There was only one car moving from the left and he was turning right.  It was the car **after** the car turning right that hit him.  No way he could have, or should have, predicted that. 
2 Exactly. We most likely won't get do-overs when on 2 wheels. Green in my case means make eye contact with everyone, then go. 
2 This. I Try to do this every time I turn in anywhere, never know with people or their vehicles. 
2 this is true, it is taught here in Malaysia, that green means "Go only if it is safe" so you can't just ram the people/vehicles in front of you and defend yourself that "your lane was green!"To the credit of the motorcyclist though, it did look safe, and the speeding car was behind the car on his left. For an attempt to kill someone, he should be jailed 
1 More people need to take this into consideration. Green can mean someone is still trying to make the yellow light
1 Whenever you're out in public, always assume everyone is trying to kill you. You'll notice how moronic people are when you actually watch out for it. 
1 Great advice and of course, you'll get down voted for it. I go one step further when I'm on the street on a moto- I'll use cars as barriers. If I go through an intersection, ever more so one that has blind spots, I'll try and put a car on one or both sides of me. I also use cars as a barrier in areas where a head on could occur. 
1 In terms of common sense, you're very right. But legally speaking, sounds like you're victim shaming :P
1 He definite could have been driving more defensively.  Car is clearly at fault, motorcyclist wasn't driving like everything is trying to kill him
1 I drive a car, but this is the necessary policy for where I live. Differences in driving culture from region to region is absolutely a thing, and my area is particularly bad about running red lights.You go 1-2 miles down the busiest main street in my area, you will see at least 2-5 cars running red lights. Every time.I'm not talking about, "Oh, well when I entered the intersection the light was yellow, but red while I crossed."I'm talking about a full 3-4 seconds of red light and people speed through anyway. It's particular bad with any left turns.Cops tried to crack down on it a while ago, just sitting at intersections and handing out tickets. Doesn't seem to have curbed the problem at all.
1 Yes. I don't ride a motorbike, but I always look left and right before proceeding. Takes only a second, it's very easy, and it has helped me avoid this kind of thing once or twice which makes it worth it.One thing I've noticed about a lot of other drivers is that they don't pay attention. They zone out at traffic lights. They don't look before entering an intersection. They just blindly go forward. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen someone take off from a red light just because the turning lane of traffic next to them started moving.
1 I never realized how careless of a driver I was until I got a motorcycle and started treating every other driver like they were actively trying to kill me. Now I look both ways before I roll through a green light even when I'm in a car. 
1 "Just because it's legal to go, doesn't mean it's safe to go." - Random Redditor quoting his/her father in an Askreddit a while ago regarding "what should a noob know about driving." It really stuck with me.
1 This goes for many things in life, even though traffic is probably the best example. I often see the quote "There's a lot of dead people who had the right of way".I have every lawful right to wear a tuxedo to a ghetto and I'm not at fault if something bad happens to me.. but maybe I should wear a hoodie instead. Or avoid that ghetto.Even if you have the right, why risk it?
1 I just moved from a city with red-light cameras to a city without. The difference is insane. I walk home from work through a busy intersection and it's just automatic that at least one car will run the light. Usually at least one car will run after I have the signal to walk which is delayed a couple seconds after the red.
1 He also accelerated unsafely. Should be citations for both. 
1 you live and you learn.
1 Yeah this is just called defensive driving. Stop and look both ways before crossing an intersection because you never know when some idiot is trying to run it.
1 Was the rider in the right? Definitely. But he's also the asshole that makes all the other riders look bad. If you watch the full source video, you can see him just watching the pedestrian crossing countdown, itching to get across that intersection.
1 I've avoided being T boned several times by doing this.  The last time I had people behind me *honking* at me to go because the light was green.  "Nope... this idiot isn't slowing down..."   then screeeeech, a truck slides all the way through the intersection.  I enjoyed the look on their face in my rearview mirror as they connected the dots in their head.
1 Your statement is correct however that did not stop me from receiving a ticket for impeding traffic.
1 This is so true for San Francisco and Oakland. Whenever I am at the front of the line at a stop light, I make sure to check that no one else is going to run the light after it changes to green for me. Here in SF, we have thoroughfares here that are timed so that if you're traveling at about 30pmh, you can cross most of the city without hitting a red light. One night a few weeks ago, I was driving from FIDI across the city to the Haight, and saw 3 cars run red lights in front of me in about 20 blocks. I'd have the green light, but still have to slow down before and check for stupid people running the red light. Once daylight savings is over, and it's dark here earlier, people stop paying attention when they are driving. Rain makes it even worse. 
1 Seriously lmfao. Who doesn't check both sides right when it turns green. Living in a traffic infested city made me realize there are a lot more stupid drivers than you think and you always have to be cautious of every corner. Idiots like these don't pay attention and shit happens like this.
1 Looking at the video It doesnt seem like he could have seen the car coming anyway. There was another car blocking it
1 He doesn't turn his whole head left and right to check lanes. That's why he didn't see the guy.
1 For how long? The biker waited two seconds before going. The car that hit him was hidden by cars that were turning, and he only saw it coming right before he was hit, about 3 seconds after the light changed. At what point does "being cautious" turn into "holding up a line of traffic"?
1 It was clear then he first accelerated.  The car on the left that was turning right blocked the view of the vehicle that eventually ran the red light.
1 I agree. But in this scenario, it was several seconds before this man went and it did look like he waited for intersection to clear. 
1 This has been my rule since day 1. Upvote!
0 Yea, that would be nice, until the assholes honk behind you.
-2 I live on a corner with a light. The lights down the entire 20 city blocks are timed. If you go 25mph, you hit mostly greens.   Motorcyclists on the other hand... they are always the first to the red.  Always! Such fast little men. They sit there and rev their silly little engines (does that jiggling feel good on their tiny pee pee and bubble tea sized balls, or what?) and as SOON as the light is green, they are out of the gates like a goddamned horse race. Just in time for the next red light on the next block.      But I often see cars run reds in this crazy driving city. And I think, “do motorcyclists know that not everyone stops at a red light? And that they might get hit?”  Then it dawns on me, they are too busy day dreaming about impressing everyone with their fast wittle motocycew. And it’s wowd engine. Awww. So cool. So fast. “That Guy is so cool with very big penis!” He thinks. As everyone around him just wishes him the worst and laughs at his douchey self delusion. Tiny, silly men out there.

28 >Immediately got up and started yelling at the cop. It was partly awesome but mostly terrifying. I thought that dude was gonna die.Come on, cops aren't *that* trigger happy are they?
2 I blew out my back (sacroiliitis) doing improper squats with a similar description of recovery as yours. I found that heavy indica weed really helps dull the pain while I stretch, resulting in a massive quality of life improvement. Just google "muscle pain weed strain", or browse Leafly. Hopefully you live in a sane state!
1 I was in a car accident that left me with serious and chronic neck and upper back pain. For me, having 3-4 massages a year with someone who is well versed in neuro muscular massage and myofascial release has made a huge difference.
1 Yeah, I'm pretty happy to be alive and not a mangled mess.  One of my colleagues got hit in a similar situation a few months after this accident and his wife basically lost a foot as a result.  Front bumped severed it against the side of his scooter she was riding passenger on.  All in all, this could have turned out much worse for me.
5 Correct, there's a 2 second delay after his light turned red and my light turned green.  I remember calculating it at over 5 seconds when this first happened.
12 You’re gonna jizz on their windows?Edit: wait no, I got it.
1 This. The car would’ve taken out the crossers as they started even before the biker.
2 Was the girl at ~0:27 as close to getting hit by that car as it appears?
1 Right??? I was surprised to not see something like this further up.
1 The biker might of very well saved them, lol.
1 I do this now as well, But I should note that in a sense your almost putting yourself at more risk due to drivers behind you not paying attention and going on the gas reflexively when the light changes - benefit is it would be slower imact.  I've seen this happen a few times in my mirrors since this accident.
1 Exactly. That's some pretty non-defensive riding there.

1 That's Peter Parker IRL! I'm confused as to why he's taking a motorcycle anywhere though. 
0 Hes not ded
2 It was at this moment Jackson knew - he'd fucked up.
3 I couldn't see the guy because the cab turning right blocked my vision of him barreling down the street
2 The car appeared when he was mid travel, he sees it coming just doesn't have time to react, it was on the cars end to react and stop, if the biker tries to dodge it, he risks hitting other people

1 > Did the driver get his license revokeHahahahahahahahahaha
1 The landing...?
2 > could of  Did you mean could've? -------------------------------------- I am a bot account.
2 I dunno, he needs to accelerate to get through the intersection, he does notice the car coming without much time to react, I bet he was thinking that the car might stop, which is what usually happens.
2 I agree. It looks like the collision could have been avoided.
1 Reddit would rather be right and dead than cautious and alive. 
23 Pretty much nothing is safe
9 Are you suggesting that no one goes on green lights and we just have gridlock 24/7?
15 Fuck off
6 That was no tail end of yellow, that was well red by then, pedestrians started crossing.that was in no way the mc riders fault
3 Yeah fuck that motorcyclist for waiting 5 seconds to make sure the intersection was clear.  He obviously should have waited 10+ seconds *after* the light had turned green to make super sure nobody was going to run the red light. Fuck off with the bullshit victim blaming. 
1 Yep.
1 Except the light was green for a good 5 seconds or so before the biker accelerated and subsequently got hit. Fuck off with the victim blaming.  
1 Exactly. Don't *assume* that cross-traffic is going to stop just because you have the green light.
53 Dude in the car ran a red and was fully hidden behind the other car, even from the higher vantage point of the helmet cam. I'm of the opinion he should have looked as well, but he was definitely not the one in the wrong.
23 I'm with you, its why I look both ways before going at a green light, but its still not his fault, that driver blatantly ran a red light.
12 Bad luck motorcyclist: wait for guy to run red, get rear ended
5 I always look left and right even down a one way street. I might not be stupid, but I can’t trust someone else isn’t. 
2 But he did...
-2 Especially on a motorcycle. I feel like I'd be just about triple checking everywhere I went with all the videos of dumb drivers I see. 
-19 That's it, just because u have the right away doesn't mean you should go right away.
5 how about a clueless car driver who ran the red light
3 Might be more than just 6 blunts. Don't run red lights?
3 Please get cancer.
2 He did wait before going lol.
2 That's not even close to the laws on this. 
3 Coast was clear, the other guy was behind a van. To the motorcyclist all traffic had stopped at the lights, that is why he is looking left and right as you can see from the camera movements.Are you supposed to creep out until you can see behind the stopped van before accelerating?
3 Kind of like how SpaceX calls a rocket explosion an "Unplanned Rapid Disassembly". Technically right and pretty funny.
761 "Pull over""What the fuck do you mean pullover, leather jacket."
208 Pretty comical, but maybe he meant the golf 
155 The driver was likely in shock and just said that because “that’s what you say for an accident”. I’m sure most people have been in a situation where you’re leaving for a trip and someone calls you, they say “Have a nice trip” and you instinctively say “You too” even though they’re not going on a trip. Same thing.
32 RIP beautiful Triumph Daytona
4 It's hard to tell, but I think he might actually say "I'll pull over." 
6 “Actually it’s a cardigan but thanks for noticing!” 
3 Think he might have said I'll pull over? 
1 Is my hearing complete shit? I can barely make out what either of them is saying.
1 "I'm already pulled over!  I can't pull over any further!"
265 Audio seems pretty muffled, probably couldn't hear anything anyway.
30 He does, you just have to turn the volume way up
1 You can kind of make out his scream
173 Someone who drives a car.
60 Yep, usually only used when talking about cars in a negative light, such as idiot drivers, or when the "riding season" is over and riders downgrade to a car.EDIT 2: It's used to refer to idiot drivers because most idiot drivers are completely oblivious to what's going on around them, like they're in a cage. Ty to /u/SobeyHarker for the reminder.EDIT: When talking about downgrading to a car, "cage" can also refer to it feeling like a cage, which is very much true. Half of the fun of bikes is being exposed to the elements and feeling/hearing everything instead of sitting in a box listening to the dull drone of sound insulation/road noise at the same "ideal" temperature every day.
98 > What's a cager?The opposite of an organ donor
96 Mostly a derogatory term used by motorcyclists to describe car drivers. It's a pretty stupid term.
26 not a roll cage, but a cage specifically, like a dog cage.  Meaning they're isolated from the outside world.
3 It's someone who takes full advantage of the last 100 years worth of car safety advancements rather than ride one of those death traps.Don't get me wrong bikes are cool as fuck, but this video shows *exactly* why it isn't worth it to me.
3 a really cringey insult. this is coming from a guy with a bike
2 Someone who lives their life in a cage instead of free in the wind.  Doesn't always work out that great as you can see.
1 ITT: butthurt cagers
1 Yes
1 It’s a term losers who don’t drive a car label anyone who’s an adult who owns a car. Used by SJWs
190 No he's there. Pretty sure he's the guy in the grey hoodie and hat who runs over and starts apologizing 
10 Yeah he pulls up and parks next to the bike, you can see an empty spot that has a silver car in it afterwards.
4 I think it's his silver car angled in towards the sidewalk on the same side of the road the bike is on later in the video.
164 He didn't jump the signal. It was green for a couple seconds before we went. But still, check the cross traffic.
17 As a current biker, some of these accidents baffle me. People on motorcycles and in cars for that matter, have this assumption that others will abide the traffic laws. In a car, sure, you have some additional protection to take those chances but holy shit! Why chance that on a bike? I've avoided multiple accidents just from assuming that the guy inching his way out is going to pull out in front of me or assuming the person rolling up to a red light is going to run it. I say this on my high horse and now I'll make my own dumbass mistake. Let's hope not!
22 Please don't follow this advice as it slows down trafic.Put your life at risk for the greater good.
2 I always try to let a car go 1st. Left turners are the worst. I try to use a car to the left of me to cover me through the intersection.
2 Laws of man don't outweigh the laws of physics 
2 This is exactly the right answer. I always wait and check traffic as I’m passing through an intersection got this exact reason. I just assume some idiot is running a red at every intersection. In the video you can see the driver coming through but the rider has no idea. He’s watching in front of him instead of to the sides 
-1 Accidents like this are so rare here, it’s not worth it to slow down traffic.
73 Insurance covers ambulance rides. But depending on his plan, he likely has a decent sized deductible. If you have $1,000 deductible and the ambulance costs $400, you have to pay 400 out of pocket, they'd only cover the costs after the first 1,000. Better plans have lower deductibles but cost more per month.If he was seriously hurt, he'd take the ride and not end up paying for it since the total treatment would be well over 1,000. But since he knows he's fine, he'd end up paying for the ride himself.
19 When my wife was hit a while back, she was billed for the ambulance ride but the at fault person's insurance company told her not to pay it, to send a copy of any bills to them and notify the hospital and ambulance company that it's being handled by the insurance, so it doesn't go into arrears. It still applied towards her own insurance deductible, but she didn't have to come out of pocket for it. We're actually still waiting on the whole case to close out; they owe her a pain and suffering settlement, though they already paid for her car (it was totaled) and we've replaced it. 
4 I was in shock and wasn't thinking clearly.  I should have taken that ambulance ride in hindsight.  My left ankle is still messed up.
2 Absolutely.
1 He likely wouldn't pay for it but it would be a hassle to deal with the bill/insurance. Unless you really need one, it's not a good idea to take an ambulance in the US. 
1 Friend was in the US travelling. Got hit by a car off his bike and has to decline the ambo, they said it could cost him up to 30k and he has no insurance and had to get home.. drove to Cali with broken ribs..
1 Just give a fake name and social security number and you'll never be billed for an ambulance ride.
0 You don't need an ambulance for everything. 1. its a waste of time and money and 2. someone else might need one more than he does. 
-1 An ambulance ride is like $5-$7,000. It's cheaper to get an Uber to the hospital, pay the driver to detail their car from blood stains and buy a new motorcycle.Or let the paramedics care for you as much as they can and then heal yourself. We already pay taxes for that service.
0 Because if his life is not at risk, there is no need for an ambulance ride.
8 The camera is on the top of his helmet so that’s probably giving him a good 5 inches of height 
1 Maybe, helmet + camera anchor definitely adds to the perception.
36 Made me kinda happy that people came to help rather than the bystander effect taking place
16 Looks like he already got plenty of air...
1 We need to get smarter people involved. Paging /r/conspiracy 
3 I don't like it. It's like calling straight people "breeders." It's kinda pretentious and implies that there is something wrong with driving a car. You know, what like 99% of people drive.
1 Nope he's the guy who touches the bikers knee towards the end. (probably)
1 Im confused what? 
1 Seriously. That little girl should be straight in there offering medical knowledge and advice. What a bitch. 
8 What? Why?
150 I witnessed a guy get hit by a car, break his leg with a bone sticking out and still walk 10m or so before collapsing. Adrenaline is the shit. 
54 I got a broken bone highsiding off my bike at 15 miles an hour or less. He could have a busted toe or something 
2 I broke my arm driving against a car with like 10 km/h. I was still sitting on my bike and the car didn't have more than a small dell, 
1 Ya the chances of him inuring his hip are mighty high. His ass just bounced off a car so hard it made him do a front flip.
1 [It doesn't take much to break a bone. And not always one that you'd expect.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1bVCfCW1y8I)
1 Tht whiplash gonna get him in next day or so...
1 Better than going up and falling on the pavement. Just no serious injury, luckily.
1 Description of the source says he walked away with only bumps and bruises.
1 Yeah first time I went down on my bike I broke the fuck out of my toe. I then proceeded to smush it back into place because I couldn't feel it yet. 
2083 [Different camera angle](https://i.imgur.com/Zj6Okat.gifv)
1 I'm pretty sure he landed on the bonnet. Roll over it wouldn't cause a dent. 
33 Yup.My husband was waiting at a red light once, a woman ahead of him started off as soon as the light turned green, only to get t-boned by a car chased by police. No bueno.I *always* look both ways to make sure it's clear and safe to proceed when the light changes.
15 However the person running the red could plainly see that their light was red and went anyway, when it was neither safe nor legal.Also I'm pretty sure they couldn't see the guy on the bike because of the other car making a legal right turn and blocking their view.
3 Especially for us little guys. I don't ride a motorcycle, but I ride a bicycle a lot, including on somewhat busy city streets. It doesn't matter who has the right of way, or who's at fault for the crash. If a biker is involved in a crash with a car, the biker is most likely going to the hospital while the driver walks away.That's not to say your comment isn't applicable to driver's in cars as well, but just that these situations are even more dangerous for people like myself and the guy in the video. We don't have crumple zones, air bags, and seatbelts between us and all the idiot drivers
2 Yeah, learned this the hard way a few months ago as well. I always look before I hit the gas at a green now.
1 I read that somewhere and think about it frequently too.
1 That’s a perfect way to think of it. I moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico a year ago. The civic pastime is seeing how many cars can sail through a red light going 70 mph.
1 The only laws you can guarantee a car will follow are the laws of physics. Don't rely on other laws to keep you alive.
135 Yeah, I had a motorcyclist friend who got hit by a car, went to the hospital because she'd had her daughter riding pillion and was worried about concussion.  Daughter checked out as okay, bruises and contusions but nothing serious, so they got her out of the hospital and headed home. My friend sits down in the car sent to pick her up, and _then_ realizes she has three fractured ribs.Adrenaline is a hell of a drug.
34 Yep, this is why people recommend that you never say "don't worry I'm okay!" and leave without exchanging information. Adrenaline is human rocket-fuel. Looks like his bike is wrecked though :( 
2 I walked away from this accident with no broken bones, just major whiplash.  Although, my ankle has been kinda messed up every since the accident.  Source - I'm the one featured in this gif.Give me ad revenue by watching the video here (CLICK THE AD!):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr6R5dQa8hY
38 Not that much, but at least in my case it has always been the kind of rage in which I want to give the guy a lecture on where he has gone wrong in life, not the murderous kind.
1 None, don't assault people.
1 No idea, couldnt possibly figure it out with contexual clues whatsoever.
-2 lol american "education"
3 I don't know what you're talking about, you ninny!
94 Did the car that hit him get cited as well?
3 You must wait until the intersection is completely cleared.
1 Mom got a ticket once for getting t-boned, she was in middle of intersection turning left on an arrow, light turns green as shes almost through turn and a car plows into her she got a ticket for failure to yield.
1 Sounds like he lives where I do. The govt owned insurance corporation makes and enforces the traffic laws. All accidents involving insured motorists are judged 50/50. Uninsured motorists are never at fault. All about profitability could care less about driver safety.
1 Had this happen to me. Still don't understand how it's possible
1 That is such bullshit - I want to know how that held up in court.
89 You're not supposed to see ninjas, so who is the one really at fault, hmm?
7 It was actually a Daytona 675
2 Ninja flips over car, sticks the landing and just stands there, slowly turning around, katana already in hand. Unsheathed it mid-air. Do you accept your fate or attempt escape?
2 Most people aren’t getting how clever this is!
18 Nah... probably just mad that the motorcycle rider made him late.
3 Thanks for making me (actually) laugh today. 
59 From my point of view, the Jedi are guilty.
19 I ran all the lights. And not just the green ones, but the yellows and reds too.
2 Because the car is guilty 
3 From my point of view, the Jedi are evil

1 Just imagine him yelling "Faaack youuu..." and then just walking away.
1 It’s almost weirdly scarier when someone yells at you with clean swears. 
43 In the source video you can tell the dude is really rattled. Just kind of walks to the sidewalk and breathes while bystanders are asking him if he's okay. Guy that hits him runs up apologizing. Biker took it really well tbh
20 You, sir, are exactly right.  Source - this is me getting hit.
3 When I was in a motorcycle accident it took 3-6 hours before the shock and adrenaline rush wore off.
28 You're right.  I'd probably high five the on lookers first screaming "Did you see that shit?!  Landed it baby!" Then I would get angry hahaha
2 In the source video you can tell the dude is really rattled. Just kind of walks to the sidewalk and breathes while bystanders are asking him if he's okay. Guy that hits him runs up apologizing. Biker took it really well tbh
1 No in the longer video he just walks out of the street amd people come up to check hes okay.
2 Watch your profamity
6 Of course not, that's what the internet is for
1 Spot on - shock set in immediately for me.  You can't think straight with all that adrenaline and pain.
2 I can't believe you've done this.
1 Damn.  I mean I would have been upset but idk if I would have gotten THAT unreasonable. 
348 Btw non-bikers of Reddit, "ATGATT" means "all the gear, all the time". Typically helmet, gloves, and slide-resistant jacket/pants/sometimes boots with knee/elbow/shoulder/ankle pads.Edit: and fwiw the Daytona 675 has an MSRP of $14,000, so I wouldn't be surprised if he just lost a $20k bike :(
97 Driver should have 'exchanged information' with the police.I hate how often incidents like these get passed over as insurance matters. Driver needs to be charged with whatever local laws cover jumping lights and hitting someone barely less vulnerable than a pedestrian.
6 That’s why I hate driving in downtown San Francisco.
12 Windscreen?  Is that a West Coast thing?  Americans call it a windshield. 
1 > downtown San Francisco at the intersection of Ellis St at Cyril Magnin StThe building in the top left is the Park 55 for anyone who might recognize the building but not the street names
1 How do you know?
8 I appreciate the thoughtful criticism kind stranger. I failed to convey my thoughts as English isn't my first language. What I ment in the last part is my guardian expressing concern that my demise will not be something of my doing but of some grand stupidity commited by someone else.
125  Yeah, death inducing physics doesn't care of you had "right of way" - so you must ride defensively. 
24 When you're on a bike, there is no reason to be stubborn about laws. The only thing that matters is that you're safe. Like OP said, green light doesn't mean go for a biker; this is something any MTC will teach you because you are at the bottom of the food chain. Even one of those smart cars will beat you lol You're not at fault for not following this rule, but when your life is at stake, does fault mean a damn thing? 
12 That's the danger of being on a bike, it's no consolation that you were right when the tiniest fender bender can kill you. 
4 Yeah, if he’d glanced he’d have seen that the car was going too fast to stop, and should never have crossed that intersection. You can’t just drive/ride blindly and assume everyone is following the rules. 
1 Agreed, this is how my mom drives and how she taught me to drive.
1 Yeah, that car either fully intended to run the light or wasn't even looking at the light. They rolled through at speed from way back, and only stopped when they realized they hit something. Stopping and looking (which the cyclist did) couldn't have helped. I've almost been hit several times crossing the Kroger parking lot because a car comes out of nowhere at highway speed and runs the stop signs right through the crosswalk. That's after looking twice and looking again while walking. Ignorant drivers are everywhere.
1 I live near lots of train tracks and realized a few years ago that we really put a lot of trust into the train signals and all it takes is one of those things to fail and you're dead.  I check left and right every time now like the buses do. 
1 >You shouldn't be being downvoted for this,LOL +708 upvotes
1 Yeah. Doesn't matter if you're at fault or not if you're dead. To put it plainly.
1 Not only is this good advice for motorcycles but also cyclists. Cars often don't see bikes because of their skimpy frames and when they run reds it can be disastrous. 
1 In Ireland that's not even advice, it's the law. Green means "go if it is safe to do so" and red means "stop of it is safe to do so".
-14 >Doesn't make the motorcyclist in this instance in any way responsibleYes it does.
24 I also like, "Plenty of dead people had the right of way."
3 I do this too. Saved my ass a few times. Just because you have the right of way doesn't mean you're going to win at life. Usually the car hurtling through the intersection wins vs your car getting T boned. One time, there was a signal that was out due to heavy rain. All cars are doing the 4 way stop and go at the intersection. It was my turn to go after a few cars and I creep up into the intersection just to make sure no idiot is going and BAM some lady on her phone not paying attention AT ALL blows through the intersection. Saved my life honestly.
25 There shouldn't be any yellow if there is a green. If that is the case, then the programming faulty. 
4 Yellow will not show when there is green on the other side. 
2 To be fair.  He couldn't see the car behind the other traffic and it looks like the car turned into him.  I still agree with you.
1 Unless I'm alone at the intersection I always let a car go first into the intersection.
1 I think I'm dumber after reading that, and I didn't even make it past the 2nd paragraph. 
12 They teach that exact rule in basically every motorcycle course.
-1 he's both wrong and right. 
21 [Of course they aren't! American police are helpful 100% of the time!](https://imgur.com/gallery/gqv0j) NSFW
1 I thought the motorcyclist was going to die during the impact with the car, not at the hands of the police officer. :)
-2 Even in that situation, you can't physically threaten a cop
2 Thanks ! Will look it up. Sometimes the pain area is so focused I wonder if a surgeon can just “dig it out”. I have no idea really if muscles can be injured and send out pain signals around such a precise location 
2 > You’re gonna jizz on their windows?> Shock does strange things to a man..
3 Yeah, but it was more like she almost got taken out by my motorcycle which went flying through the crosswalk.  Barely missed her.  Later in the footage you can see where the bike ended up after hitting a piece of equipment directly past the crosswalk - it definitely would have kept going up onto the sidewalk if wasn't for that equipment

1 Did he apologise at least?
0 A more alert rider might have avoided this collision
0 He left the second the light turns green. I'm not saying it's not the cars fault, but if you're a motorcyclist you should know that green doesn't mean go. Especially in a busy intersection like this.
1 In the full length video seems like he just drove off. Just wondering if he got any penalties 
0 No, I'm saying that just because there is a green light that says you can proceed it doesn't mean someone isn't going to skip their red light, just like this. Just a reminder to have a *proper* look before you start going.  Not to say that is the exact situation here as clearly the car was hidden from view by another car.
-3 So you're saying that the motorcyclist SHOULD have floored it through the intersection? You can get into accidents that you aren't liable for, but you can also avoid those same accidents with good driving practices. The motorcyclist opened himself up to additional risk by accelerating so hard, even if it's not his "fault."
-2 No one is claiming that it's not the driver's fault. We're saying that if the motorcyclist had been more cautious and alert, this collision might have been avoided.
2 Where did you get 5 seconds? I count 2 second between the light changing green and the motorcyclist accelerating into the intersection.No one is arguing that the driver isn't responsible for this collision. The point is, if the driver had been a bit more cautious and alert to his surroundings, this incident might have been avoided.Back when I used to ride, I never assumed that cross-traffic was going to stop, even if they had a red light.
0 So much salt; too bad you can't read. All he had to do was NOT accelerate so hard, but he chose the riskier play and got run over for it.
-3 5 seconds my ass. I hope your cognitive dissonance ends catches up with you sooner rather than later and the only person who ends under getting hurt is you. 
-48 I would beat the shit out of him.
12 My dad would probably say:You can be dead right, but you're still dead.
4 I've seen someone go down a one way before the wrong way. 
14 Right of way, not right awaySorry if you know this and it was part of the joke but I figured there's a chance you might actually think it's right away, I mean just last week I learned kawaii is pronounced kawa-ee and not ka-wī

75 Most bikers who have go pros strapped to their helmet or bike have a protective cover that muffles the mic sound immensely. Mainly to protect the camera from rocks or if they do fall it would prevent most scratches but all the casing is is a plastic airtight casing that is meant for underwater filming. Needlessly to say it prevents some damage in most cases.

12 I am downgrading to a car soon due to the weatherFucking cagers man :D
1 my car has windows.
1 It's more about that they're totally oblivious to what's happening around them. Thus in a cage.
1 If I ever start riding a bike and refer to other people in cars as cagers please run me over 
2 I ride a motorcycle and make sure to sign the spot for organ donation. I'm ok with my motorcycling providing organs for people that need them. It's a win-win.  I get to ride until I die, and they get organs. How is that bad?
1 You aren't an organ donor? 
-24 Aren't you edgy
68 Although in this case its earned.
12 reminds me of people on r/vegan calling meat eaters 'carnists' 
5 Is it derogatory? Most riders I know have a car as well, and describe driving it as "getting back into the cage." I don't really sense a derogatory intent towards the actual *driver*, but more to the vehicle itself - poor guy, stuck in his cage :( 
2 Used by bicyclists as well.  It's not stupid at all.
1 It's very triggering for most drivers, so use it wisely. 
-9 I've also never heard it outside of reddit.
87 and isolated from dying if hit by another car, but i guess motorcyclists are too cool to consider that a bonus
25 ah cool. i didn't have sound for it, ty
15 You mean the creeper who touches the motorcyclist's knee at the end? 
3 He could just be Canadian.
108 Yup. Unfortunately for the motorcyclist, the car turning right on red masked the light-runner one lane over.
1 I typically get off the line quick on a green. Lately I've seen more and more cars, including a tractor trailer, run reds well after we get a green near where I live and I would be crushed if I was the first in line. Definitely give an extra check now.
-22 Green is merely a suggestion. No one owns the intersection. 
9 It almost looks like the striking car driver was doing one of those signature New York City moves where they turn right from the second lane to try to get a jump on the people in the crosswalk.
2 Same, not like we lose any time over it. As soon as he clears the intersection he can take his light ass bike straight up to speed in a half second anyway, what's the rush? 
1 What do you think he should have done here? Waited longer? He was already stationary for a few seconds after the light turning green. Any longer and he'd get other motorists blaring their horns at him and holding up traffic. 
2 Haha on a serious note the biker should have turned his head 10 degrees left while applying throttle then brake as you notice the car barreling up to the light. Its called defensive driving. As a trucker i cringed when that light turned green and the biker fully committed without fucking looking. Always look both ways! Even on a green.  
1 In CA, the DMV will cut you if you don't do a traffic check during the driving test.
3 1 second delay is not going to slow down traffic any appreciable amount. And if you honk at that, you can suck a big one.
63 The guy that hit him would be responsible for all damage though both to the bike and to him. He shouldn't have any medical bills
4 That is so fucked up.
2 Also, sometimes insurance only covers an ambulance ride that's "medically necessary," as determined weeks later by insurance adjusters, not on the scene by trained medical professionals.
2 Such a fucked up country
2 Good God that is fucked up.
1 Yeah, but the ambulance would take him to the ER, and an ER visit is at least another 1000 if he has to get any xrays. If he hit his head he might get a CT scan, that's gonna be even more. He'll totally hit his deductible. Unless its a high deductible plan then it can be like a $5000 deductible and you wonder why you're even bothering to pay for the insurance.
1 Insurance doesn't cover ambulance rides. They cost around 400-500. If u get airlifted you might as well wish you died because that could be $10,000-$25,000 on top of your serious medical treatment. 
3 So, do you don a sunglasses/fake nose/moustache combo before the paramedics get there so you can sneak away and check into the hospital independently when you arrive there?
3 I'm pretty tall actually.
1 oh for some reason I thought what we saw at the bottom of the video was a jawline protector of some sort
10 seriously, would much rather have a lot of people asking if they could help instead of just watching
1 Except most were bystanders. 
1 The crowd forming around him and not doing anything just standing and watching.
1 No, but maybe keep your kids away from accident scenery? The kid obviously can't help and neither does the mom. There really is no need to stand right next to the victim and stare.
4 Cause all motorcyclists are punks!!!1!1
2 Because he can't drive.
54 I was in a dirt bike - car collision. My mom turned into a driveway on a blind corner, dirt bike hit front right of the car around 50 mph. He bounced off the roof and tried to land on his feet. Absolutely destroyed his ankles. I watched the paramedics cut his boot off and shattered pieces of bone fell onto the road. Couple years later and he's back to hauling ass on his dirt bike up and down that same road. 
63 I read that as 10 miles before I realized I'm a moron.
2 I genuinely got T-Boned on my bike two weeks ago. I managed to take my helmet, backpack and most of my jacket off with a broken humerus and untold amounts of damage to my left rotator cuff and ligaments. I say untold because the bone hasn't healed enough to even think about testing the joint. Adrenaline is fucking nuts. I felt normal and 10 minutes later my pain was a 10/10 in the ambulance. 
2 My horse threw me into a jump (cracked three bones in my face) and it took two people to hold me down because my body just decided it was going to get up and walk away.
1 Until you actually feel a true life or death adrenaline rush it’s hard to describe. Split seconds slow down so much it’s like your Neo in the Matrix. Such a trip.
13 i'm surprised you haven't broken more just high siding at any MPH.
3 I got hit by a car head on while riding my motorcycle and didn't break anything. Nasty gash on my side but no broken bones. Kind of crazy how accidents work. I have seen tiny accidents cause some nasty issues and then major accidents cause none.
1 Highsiding will fuck you up. Glad it wasn't more severe, even at such a reasonable speed.Did you hit a puddle or leaves or something?
1 I broke a rib after drinking an entire bottle of Fireball and then going sledding with my cousin.Anything is possible.

5 Whenever I do this and I’m with my sister she freaks because “I’m taking too long to make a turn after the light turns green.” I fear she never looks around when turning at a light, just goes for it like the lady in your story. 
3 That is clearly true. But I'm certain that motorcyclist would rather have waited for the asshole, illegal red light runner to get through the intersection than to get hit by the asshole illegal red light runner.
76 As an EMT, this is why we're cutting your pants off no matter how expensive they were. You could have a broken leg and not even know it due to the adrenaline or other injuries distracting you. 
2 Just put some adrenaline in the tank, hopefully he'll at least be able to ride it home 
3 Omg same. I lecture in my head well after such incidents. 
2 Sounds like tea drinker speak 
3 We call it a hood, you call it a bonnet. The fuck does education have to do with it? 
3 I pinky promise there are plenty of people out there smarter than you who say "hood". 
64 I don't think so. I think the reason why is that the other car was in the intersection before the light turned red and his turned green. 
2 Yes, the guy got cited for running the red light.  I gave the cops my footage on scene after I showed it to them in the back of the ambulance while on scene.
2 It's not bullshit. It depends on what took place. You can have an intersection full of vehicles when your light turns green. Just because your light is green, doesn't give you the right to enter the intersection.

1 you're forgetting I just got hit my a multiple thousand pound object at 35mph.  My body didn't really work after I came to my senses in the crosswalk.
1 Well that's restrained
2 Seriously, who has to go looking anymore? I just fire up the ol' web browser and get a lifetime supply of rage inducing people piped directly into my office.
75 TIL. Thank you! :-)
11 I'm unfamiliar with the acronym, but I always say, but the bike assuming you'll never come off, but buy the gear assuming you will.ATGATT might get hot in summer, but it's the only way to ride. Have crash tested my fair share from cars doing illegal turns without looking & have been lucky not to be seriously injured. You can learn how to improve your perception of other drivers from each accident though, so you get better at avoiding them with experience.
4 I get so pissed on behalf of motorcyclists when they are riding in shorts and a t-shirt (or even worse, a tank top, have yet to see shirtless riders) and even more so if they have a passenger they let on without PPE. People, you do not want to go through having a massive skin graft because an entire side of your body got zested by asphalt. Also I regret writing this during lunch, as I am now visualizing what I just wrote.
3 It was about 10K, but had about 100 hours of custom work I did myself on it.  So, yeah,  I was heavily emotionally invested in it after putting all that work in.  All good, I got a 675R out of it, upgrade!
1 How do you put 6k of mods into a bike that already has top-of-the-line everything? 
1 I don't ride myself, but I had a few friends that did, and they were of the ATGATT mind set. So I got used to seeing this as the norm. I now live in a state where motorcycle helmets are not required by law, just recommended. It blows my mind to see people on the high way with shorts and t-shirts and no helmet on going 70 mph. 
53 Yep, police should have been called and that guy cited for dangerous driving. If it's just an insurance matter lawyers will lawyer the fuck out of it and the rider will end up thanking the driver's insurance company for returning his destroyed bike.
3 In CA the driver of the car would be required to notify the DMV because of personal injury.  He isn't getting away with anything
1 Dutch traffic law (probably in most of EU as well) requires a police investigation if there is physical injury (which is not equal to if the ambulance gets called), even after the fact if it would not get reported on scene. So over here this would result in an investigation when reported, and insurance will force a report if physical harm is in play. Though for nothing more than fenderbenders or no harm, police isn't required. Not that it's discouraged to call authorities though, they should still come, but more in a managing and mediating role.
-4 I don't believe that hitting a bike is a more serious crime than a car. And lets be real, a biker chooses to ride a bike knowing how dangerous is it. They shouldn't get even more privileges than they already have. Obviously, this is the cars fault, but if this guy was driving a car, it wouldn't make the collision more legal. Running the red and hitting a vehicle will nail this guy. I don't see how he doesn't get hit with some big fines even if they didn't call the police
2 I mean right off the bat if you bring a car with you into downtown San Francisco you've made a dire mistake
2 My initial reaction was this is probably San Francisco. Drivers here are so fucking oblivious. This is especially true for Uber and Lyft drivers. I've been conditioned to stop when I have the signal to cross and a Prius or any vehicle with an obnoxious Uber or Lyft sticker in the window is approaching. No one seems to have any idea of where they are going or understand the concept of lanes, and running red lights is normal. As is stopping in the middle of the street or freeway after missing a turn or exit. It's especially bad this time of the year, when it gets dark earlier in the day and during rains. Once the sun goes down, it's a total shit show out there. 
38 If you say "bonnet", "boot", or "windscreen", you may be a Brit. 
9 Absolutely not a west coast thing, we call ‘em windshields. I’m guessing the dude is British.
3 Windscreen is what it's called on a motorcycle, or at least it is on a sportbike like he's got. Seems like he accidentally used the bike term instead of the car term
2 No idea, I've lived here pretty much all my life and have never heard it been called "windscreen"
1 [deleted]
1 In the video title he also calls the other driver a "cager" so ~~I'm assuming he's a Brit.~~
1 Eh, I've heard it both ways.
2 That's me in the gif.
3 A very thoughtful and rational response to criticism. I'm going to upgrade the score from a 6/10 to an 8/10 thanks to the subtextual insight provided to me. Thank you, Mister Director. 
3 no it was pretty obvious what you meant in your first comment. I don't get how the person you are replying to didn't understand. Unless english isn't their first language either.
10 If there was one lesson that stuck with me as a kid was a story about "the right of way." Believe it had a line that went something like "The man knew when he had the right of way, and he was always right, this time he was right again but the steel wins the fight." If you always go the right of way you will always be right, but one day you will be dead right. The exact story/poem eludes me but the message sticks.
14 "You are right, but your are dead" - Cum Redditor 
2 > The morgue is full of people who had the right of way
0 >You're not at fault for not following this rule, but when your life is at stake, does fault mean a damn thing? I totally get your point and I'm not disagreeing, but fault definitely means something when it comes to pursuing damages.
54 The car went through the intersection *very* late. I always check before heading in on a green, but the guy running the light was so far out to lunch I don't think I would have seen him either 
12 Victim blaming is a fun game, but reality is even if he had followed your advice and glanced (assuming he didn't, the camera doesn't follow his eyes), the car could have been blocked by the one turning right.
26 While I agree with the statements above about how you should always be sure to look before green, I think the dude had plenty of time to stop. It looked like the guy in the same lane before him was turning right, which means he should have been slowed down anyway. 
3 I watched the gif, the car was hidden by one turning right. 
3 It seems like the car that was turning right might have blocked his view of the car heading straight.
1 I had someone this very morning pull forwards through a red light as I was already directly in front of them. Fortunately got them on camera. Unfortunately my voice broke into a shrill flurry of weak expletitives so don't fancy uploading it!
1 You not bother reading the bit at the end, eh?
3 Insurance adjuster here, car is 100% at fault no question. 
1 It was clear when he accelerated.
-1 Okay you guys took that a bit literal lol. A person is zooming trying to make a yellow, it turns red. Other lights turn green. Bam. Collision. 
1 I agree, but someone accelerating while yellow runs the chance of it turning red. Other lights turn green. Bam. 
-1 Read the entire thing. It’s a general consensus of motorcycles that one forms after 7 years of living on a moderately traveled city street.  Cars driving by: Safe travels buds!Motorcycles revving at all hours: take your tiny balls and place them at the bottom of a steep ravine fuck heads!  You don’t happen to ride a loud motorcycle do you?
12 WARNING TO ALL WHO GO THROUGH THIS LISTNSFW - There are humans AND dogs being MURDERED by police.Seriously man, I can't handle those poor dogs that were just standing there. That ~~person~~ monster that pulled that trigger deserves a one way trip to hell. They were standing and doing nothing.
3 I shouldn't have watched that... The poor dog trying to run away after 3 fucking shots... Goddamnit...
1 Goddamn, man.
2 Who said anything about physically threatening a cop?
1 Implying jizzing on windows is abnormal. LOL!
1 Thanks for the response! I remember seeing what I presume was the original post in /r/motorcycles and also being extremely sad for the Daytona. Glad everyone ended up okay for the most part. Seems like everything could have been so much worse.
1 Yeah, but cops got there really fast and separated us so I didn't speak to him for more than a few seconds.  I was definitely in shock.
2 Yeah, but no one is 100% alert while driving for hours a day, that's why the rules of the road are pretty simplistic to accommodate for that. All lights are red before they rotate green.  The car should of stopped before actually colliding, the biker knew it was coming and didn't anticipate the car driver to be so bad.  The rules of driving are under assumption everyone follows them accordingly, if the biker waited longer, the guy behind him would of beeped cuz the light was green. If the biker tries to dodge the car, he risks hitting the pedestrians on his right, if the biker breaks, his risks getting rear ended.  At the end of the day, the guy driving the car was in control of the situation. If the biker went faster that would if actually been the best thing lol or predicted the future and wait 5 seconds everyone a light turns green
7 there was a car in way of line-of-sight with the speeding vehicle.  The motorcyclist would have to be in the middle of the intersection to get a "proper look."
3 He didn't immediately floor it, the lights were green, he paused, then he went. He might of accelerated quickly because he felt late on the green light
1 That was not accelerating hard at all.  And my point was about that not being s close run thing on the lights they were well green before he set off. 
12 No you wouldn't.
1 Wait what
-3 Hawaii is also Hawa-ee, which is probably why I've also seen it spelled Hawa'ii.
1 If that motorcyclist would have just run the red light he wouldn't have been hit *by that car.*
104 Yeah! Killer boots, man!
1 Pumpkin pie hair-cutted freak. 
29 Potion seller, enough of these games!
17 Are we sure a guy on the sidewalk didn't say pull over to the guy in the car?
-1 I thought it was another guy saying that but maybe he was issuing himself a command? Maybe he doesn’t do well under pressure/s
21 Ha! The same thing here is your brain going on autopilot, though the cause (shock vs distraction or whatever) is different.
3 Worked at a cinema and heard the "You too" way too many times when telling people to enjoy their films.Always made me laugh.
1 Damn sucks about the work you put in, but it's great you could upgrade! I have a 13 675r and love it to bits, that quickshifter *hnnnngggg*
4 Plus the wind noise is horrible otherwise 
1 GoPros come with two case doors, one for watertight and one for not, though they say on the camera if expecting speeds over 100mph to use the watertight one.Even below that using the watertight probably better on the mic and overall sound quality.
66 35 minute old account...Edit: if one more person messages me that it's a throwaway I'm going to kill Santa
6 Are you ok?
3 Glad you're ok man.. that shit could have been serious! As a fellow rider that gif completely turned off my sense of humor.. nothing funny about this.. although impressive gymnastics!
3 What was the outcome? How did the exchange go after the clip ended? 
0 Sucks your bike got crunched, but way to stick the landing!
1 I figured, but you probably made some sorta noise when you got hit, just muffled because of it.
103 It's more to do with the fact that cagers act like they are in a cage. As in -- safe from the world and no need to worry about anything happening outside of their safe space.AKA ignorant and careless because they feel protected. Hence the negative connotation.
33 it's a tongue-in-cheek joke. You are protected by a cage in a car (literally, the cars are designed to withstand as much damage as possible to protect the people inside it). Bikers don't have that. plus, cagers is quicker than car drivers lol 
19 Its called a cage because you are enclosed in steel, while a motorcyclist is not.Its more about the mentality involved. In a car you are comtained, caged off from the world around you. Everything happening is out there. On a bike, there is no seperation, you are part of the world. You hear and feel everything around you. Now, whether that is worth the risk or not, or how you handle and mitigate it, etc, that is entirely up to you.But I can attest, there is no comparing to the sensation of being free of the cage when on a bike.
3 Darn. Come on down to Texas (assuming you're 'murican), it was 70*F yesterday :p
1 Well yeah most of us are aware of that, I'm pretty sure most street legal motorcyclists have driven a car at some point in their life. But you're still listening to a dull drone of road noise every day. It's like living in an office building 24/7 vs going on a walk or camping. IMO one added bonus of being cage-less is that most bikes have a higher seated position than your average car, and you can stand up to get an even better view of traffic/road ahead than you already had. You can also stand up to stretch or let your sweaty ass cool down or you can stretch your legs out in either direction or whatever you want cause you're not stuck in a cage :pEDIT: Yet another bonus is that you can see traffic ahead super easily when you're trying to pass. You can stand up and look over the car in front of you, or you can ride in the left 1/3rd of the lane (like you should be doing anyways to increase visibility) and you can just lean over to your left to see cause there's not 1-2 feet of cage to your left that you need to compensate for
2 ^ yeah that's usually why it's being used to refer to idiot/unsafe drivers. Probably could've been more specific but ah well
1 You do you /shrug
1 No one said it was bad. Your insecruities are showing.Also, dying is bad, in general. 
0 I guess the only bad, is the amount of tears your poor mama is going to spill over your organless corpse.
2 Not if he doesn't die at a young age in a way that kills him but leaves most of his organs fresh and intact.My comment wasn't serious, and yours probably wasn't either, but just in case and to anyone who doesn't know, especially non-native English speakers, "organ donor" is a derogatory term for bikers.
34 What an inane fucking comment.It's literally the opposite. A Cager is a derogatory term that bikers use for people who drive cars. Organ Donor is a derogatory term that car people call bikers. Nothing edgy here dumbass.
1 It's actually kindof genius since it fits so well.  Driving around trapped in a cage, like the rest of the world doesn't exist, because if you hit something it'll probably just damage your cage.  Organ donor is just funny to me because most of the people calling me that couldn't donate their organs if they wanted to due to cholesterol issues.
11 As if carnivore wasn't already a word.
1 And /r/childfree calling everyone who has/wants/doesn't hate children "breeders"
9 Nah, I've heard people use it in person for sure, but it's way more common on the US moto subreddit for sure.
5 Well how many motorcyclists have you spoken to? 
20 Yep. 
16 Calculated and managed risk. Some can accept it, others cant. The important part is to be aware of it.Unfortanetly, many dont (see 90% of super sport and harley riders) or just get bad luck.
2 Funny too since motorcyclists wear cages on their head...
3 >isolated from dying if hit by another carThe 30,000 americans killed on our roads every year would beg to differ. And those 30,000 aren't largely at the hands of anyone other than cagers. It aint motorcycles, or bicycles, or pedestrians causing that number. It's shitty infrustructure combined with stupid cagers.
3 Yes. We are. Be jelly of pure brazen lack of fear. 
1 >too coolCorrect. B)
1 [deleted]
19 Rewatch with sound when you can; you can actually hear the driver telling the biker to "pull over".No, you didn't read that wrong.
3 You can't get sued if you make love to your victims afterwards 
1 He was just giving Daniel-san the Miyagi healing reiki.
44 THANK YOU!  Finally someone who recognizes I could not see him coming because my line of sight was blocked based on the angle.  The car was in the blind spot created by the cab when I checked that direction and started on the gas.
1 Well if he would have looked at the light that he ran, then he wouldn’t have run it 
1 Even if I'm coming up to an intersection and the light has been green for a while, I still look both ways as much as I can just in case on blind intersections.. 
1 I used to do the same before someone ran a red light and can came a couple feet from hitting me.  Always look both ways a couple times now.
19 Since it's merely a suggestion. Don't stop for any more red lights.
9 Yes, the law is only a suggestion. A suggestion that if you don't follow, it is illegal, and you can seriously injure/kill someone for wanting to get to your destination 30 seconds earlier 
5 Seriously? i think you forgot the /s
0 Downvoted while actually somewhat right; a green light is never a guarantee. Off course the law will be on your side, but yeah, what does that really buy you when the worst happens?
1 Lol what. Green means go. Of course there are idiots who run red lights. But green isn’t a “suggestion” any more than red is. 
55 well in theory.but the dude's insurance will spend as much money and time as possible arguing that theory. 
3 Assuming the guy that hit him has insurance, yes.
1 After like five fucking years of battling an insurance agency that refuses to pay out on it's *basic fucking prerogative*. 
3 How tall, roughly?
3 I was smiling as I saw so many people come to help. Even though most of them had no idea what to do. 
14 Stupid is as stupid does. When it rains his ankles will probably ache  as he gets older— a reminder of his youth.
2 Wtffffffff has he threatened you with death?
14 I read that as 10 miles until I read your post lol
4 blame the misread on adrenaline. 
1 I have a motorcycle story of my own.I was going home after college and managed to hit a wall (yeah...) at about 50 km/h. No broken bones, but a torn ligament on my left pinky and a hole in my left knee. I could touch my knee cap bone through it...The thing is, it hurt, but was not that bad. I was actually worried about the bike, even though I couldn't lift it because of my now mangled, bloody finger.Anyway, got some help, jumped on the bike and headed home. Called my brother in law to take me to he hospital and he arrives in 10 minutes.On the way to the hospital, things got ugly. From the accident until the trip to the hospital it took about 20 minutes, more than enough to my body to realize that it could finally hurt. And it hurt like a motherfucker. I could feel every fucking bump, rock, and imperfection on the road. I was screaming in pain and then started laughing. It was bad.My left feet was twisted backwards, I burned my leg in two places (exhaust pipe), fucked up pinky, fucked up knee and some serious rash over my leg because I was using a jeans.My upper body was fine. I was wearing a jacket that took the damage instead of me.
5 There was a giant black truck with a steel bumper to break my fall.
377 There actually is another angle [Source](https://imgur.com/L0SWkqU)
38 [Real different angle.](https://youtu.be/17ig4WziQzM?t=19s)
2 The worst part is there probably is a different angle from one of the guys hes riding with.
25 The Fat and the Spurious?
6 Oh jesus, they made another?
1 Well I *do* actually have a bunch of gifs ready, but this one I found on the front page of /r/all about 30 minutes earlier, so it was just perfect timing this time :D
3 Just explain to her what could happen. It takes  a couple of seconds to look both ways, but it could safe lives if things turned ugly.
74 At least take me out to dinner first
2 And I thought those pretty EMT's just wanted to see my weiner....
1 Are there any situations in which you don't cut pants off?
1 "Trauma naked" is literal 
-2 dude said>lol "Bonnet."why is he laughing, if not out of ignorance and immaturity?
0 education != smarts
131 See, there is, or should be a delay. You shouldn’t be able to physically get into the dangerous part and get hit unless the other person is running the light, the switch isn’t instantaneous and you are supposed to be making an effort to stop at a yellow and not flooring it to beat the yellow 
11 Yeah no lights don't work like that. Your friend lied to you for a pity party, which you obviously gave him.
3 How fast did they take off into the intersection...?Or was the other car going really slowly?
1 What? The car that hit him? The one that absolutely entered the intersection on red?
1 Huh - that makes sense. But in the situation of entering an empty intersection as a motorcyclist on a green light to have a guy run a red light a moment later hitting me which ends in an accident as the motorcyclists fault does not make sense.
6 Fun fact: white helmets reduce crash risk by 24%>Compared with wearing a black helmet, use of a white helmet was associated with a 24% lower riskhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387473/

1 wadge yo*
5 Thank you!  The local news reporter called me Mary Lou Retten, lol.
1 I don't think it's restraint TBH 
1 After getting in an accident like that, the only thing I could think of is being happy I'm alive and not really injured. Sure it's his fault for hitting me but I'll settle it with insurance instead of getting footage of me slamming his car. Also I'm not a lawyer or anything but I'm pretty sure if you didn't his good while in a fit of rage then insurance wouldnt give you as much money so that's probably why he's keeping his cool. 
2 There's a lot of subreddits to subscribe to purely for hate-browsing purposes. /r/insanepeoplefacebook for example. 
63 There's another complimentary rider saying. **Dress for the slide not for the ride.**
11 >ATGATT might get hot in summerThat's what mesh gear, active cooling vests, cold drinks, frozen water bottles, etc are for :p
3 Yeah I can't say I don't judge squids as well. Motorcycles would be a lot more popular in the US and traffic/pollution problems would be reduced if squids weren't constantly staining other motorcyclists in name and/or blood.Also, non-bikers of Reddit, a squid is someone who is **S**tupid, **Q**uick, **U**nderdressed, and **I**mminently **D**ead as a result. The opposite of ATGATT.
2 Exhausts, better tires, engine mods, electrical mods, frame mods, etc. It'd cost me at least $800 to add decent crash bars, a skidplate, and bark busters to my adventure bike and that's just simple frame mods. Shit adds up quick.
1 Well if you never get in a crash you don't need safety gear /sIMO most of that crowd is either young men trying to look cool by riding a Ninja 650 or a Hayabusa or CBR600 or some other race bike, or old men trying to look manly and tough by riding a Harley with [ape hangers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w19_jjJCLBI/hqdefault.jpg). Neither of them care about being geared up cause the point is to look cool.
1 > I don't believe that hitting a bike is a more serious crime than a car. And lets be real, a biker chooses to ride a bike knowing how dangerous is it. They shouldn't get even more privileges than they already have.Hahahaha wtf is this bullshit.I bet you think women who get sexually assaulted when wearing short skirts probably deserve it too. You sound like a scumbag.
1 True. But depending on what I need to do, where I am, and what time it is sometimes I’d rather not do ride sharing. 
1 Definitely ride share drivers. I don’t know what is it but they do some dangerous shit. Sometimes wonder if I just notice them more because they have the sticker. But just in general people driving in San Francisco need some kind of drivers ed review. I can’t count how many times I’ve almost been hit by people running stop signs and not respecting the right of way. 
10 Don't forget ~~bumpers~~ wings, indicators & petrol :)
2 Or from any of the commonwealth countries really, we use the same terms here in India.
2 Except it's in San Francisco. 
1 Huh?
2 You should've whooped some wholesale ass. 
1 Did insurance replace your bike? 
3 Ugh. Yeah. Exactly that. Well put.
1 No, definitely. I'm just saying, that should be the *last* thing on your mind when driving.I have a friend who is incredibly stubborn about driving and gets in accidents way more often than he should because if he's not in the wrong, he doesn't care and will smash into a car for pulling out early. it's kind of insane but he has aspergers so we can't really talk him out of it, and since he's never been in the wrong, it's hard to get him to come around lol 
-1 Every accident can be avoided by either party. As your lawyer will tell you when you get in an accident like this. You will be partially at fault for any vehicle on vehicle accident where you are a driver. I had a drunk driver blow a light just like this and total my car and I had to assume responsibility for not looking hard enough. Although he was still at fault for blowing a red light while intoxicated and totaling my car.
1 Videos like this are what convinced my wife and I to put cameras in all of our vehicles. Also, yeah I'm not skilled at cursing so I'd end up saying something like "Motherdick son of a donkey what the crap you piece of horse poo!"
1 I saw that.  It doesn't make it any less funny :D  +875!
3 There's still a good delay from their light turning red to yours turning green. If a car speeds up to try to make a yellow and their light turns red at any point of them being in the intersection they will be out of the intersection before the next light turns green. Here the car isn't even near the intersection before the bike's light turns green.
3 Ah. Wasn't clear, but makes sense now.They're not making the yellow so much as trying to beat the red =) 
2 In the US, does the direction's light turn green as soon as the other one is red? Is there no "buffer" period where it's red all around?
4 My bad, I'll add a tag
-1 Cops are proof we live in hell. No benevolent god would allow such awful people to be at the top of society.
0 The guys that get shot are often physically aggressive, started by being verbally aggressive
2 Good memory - that's my original post.  Could have been much worse.  I did upgrade to a 675R as a result - got to love the Brembo brakes, Ohlins suspension, and quickshifter.  I am missing my slipper clutch though.
0 > The rules of driving are under assumption everyone follows them accordingly.But they don't, and when you're on a motorcycle, someone else's shitty driving can to easily result in *your* death. > if the biker waited longer, the guy behind him would of beeped cuz the light was green.Let him beep! When I used to ride, I never entered an intersection until I was confident that cross-traffic had stopped or was slowing down to stop.>the guy driving the car was in control of the situationAnd that's the problem. I quit riding motorcycles because no matter how defensively I drove, there were still too many distracted or inattentive drivers out there.
1 If someone cuts me off on a red light and push me of my bike trying to kill me, he would better speed of.
2 The ʻokina goes between the dual "i" letters (Hawai'i), or is left out entirely (Hawaii). It's never "Hawa'ii", the pause is between the two "i" sounds, not between the "a" and the "ii".Either of the first two are considered correct.There's also "Hawai`i" and "Hawaiʻi" if you want to bust out the Unicode and impress all the typography fans.If you want to be Portuguese you could say "Hawaií"... but maybe I'm taking this too far.
29 That John Denver is full of shit man
22 Big gulps huh?....Well, see ya!
26 God I love that movie! 
1 Those your skis?... both of ‘em?
1 POTION SELLERS ON AN OPEN FIELD NED
1 Yeah, unless the car knocked the motorcyclist's hearing sideways.
1 It was the driver of the golf who said it.  I think he was in shock too.  His adrenaline must have been through the roof.  I know mine was.
4 I do the love the quickshifter, it's a lot of fun.  The slipper clutch I had in that 2011 that got totaled was awesome too, great for city riding.  What clutch? is a better description haha.
1 There's external mic covers you can get for them that help with that but not for 60mph wind directly into the mic so I completely overlooked that fact but yeah that's what I used mine for when I used to make videos with my Go Pro
29 He said himself it's a throwaway. Can't have everyone checking out his soft core porn obsession
18 Yes because he went to the vid, made an account matching details of the bike and came back to comment here about the camera's audio.I get it's easy to lie on the internet but ffs if you're the type to go diving into account history, you should be smart enough to realize it's a throwaway and also why even lie about such an insignificant thing. Even if you caught a fake here, what would it have mattered?
12 Yeah I'm not going to dox my real account dummy.  First post I mentioned it was a throw away.
3 >I'm going to kill SantaAye good that jolly fat fuck porked my wife to be.Its a throwaway.10 points to Gryffindor!
2 Psssst... It's a throwaway.Santa is on my blacklist. 
12 Yeah, just battered and bruised, severe whiplash but no broken bones.
8 His shoes stayed on I think he'll live 
3 Thanks, stay safe out there and keep your head on a swivel at every intersection no matter how busy they are.
12 Ambulance came and checked me out.  While I was in the ambulance the cops told me the driver was trying to claim I ran the red light so I pulled out my laptop, which was somehow still working, and showed them the video on the scene.  They determined fault (his) right then and there.  The cops kept me and the other driver separate after the accident.  They took my memory card as evidence and I was able to get it a few days later.  I escorted my bike to the tow truck company's shop to say goodbye as I knew it was totaled and I had a deep sentimental attachment to it.
1 Thanks
1 only the wind getting knocked out of me like never before.
10 Nailed it.  You'll catch them in the wild chugging their big gulps while Snapchatting their friend and smoking a cigarette at 70mph.
0 This is one of the most cringeworthy things I’ve ever read. Especially since, if we’re speaking anecdotally, I’d be willing to bet you’d find at least as many stories about motorcyclists being ignorant or careless.

9 > But I can attest, there is no comparing to the sensation of being free of the cage when on a bike.I would love to ride a motorcycle, but I just don't trust other road users enough. You can be the best rider in the world, but all it takes is one asshole on their phone to put you in the hospital or worse.
1 That's something you really can't understand until you've actually ridden a motorcycle. Riding in the spring around here, you're even subjected to the smell of flowers and freshly cut lawns, and it's pretty nice.  However, the smell of a freshly squashed skunk is a whole new horrifying level of stink compared to what you smell when you're in a car. 
2 I envy your year round riding conditions but at the same time I feel like it makes riding even more special when you can only do it for a few months out of a year (living in Finland).
1 In my part of Texas it was 80. As a former Illinosian this was amazing.
1 No one I've heard call a motorcyclist an organ donor ever meant it as a compliment. It's was more along the lines of "too stupid to live." I felt I could put a happier spin on it. 
1 The only reason my mom would cry or even show up would be for the attention and sympathy from others. There won't be any real heart-felt motherly tears there. So, I'm the perfect candidate to be an organ donor. My significant other would be upset, but he's a rider too, so he would understand why I ride. 
-3 I don't know any motorcyclist that uses "cager" in a derogatory manner. It's more a commentary on the vehicle than the person inside it. Every rider I know has a car as well lol, it's not like we're in some hate-fueled pitched battle against cars. More like, they're big old cows that kinda bumble around sometimes, and we gotta watch out for that. 
-28 Wow calm down man
1 Loads, but in fairness only a couple of them were American.
6 There are two types of motorcyclers:  those who have crashed, and those who will. 
-3 pretty sure a lot of bikers don't calculate anything
1 Difference between a spaceship and a spacesuit, I guess. I, for one, am willing to sacrifice the wonderful freedom of hard vacuum for a little protective restriction of a space helmet. 
16 30k people die in car crashes = motorcycles aren't **inherently** more dangerous than a hundred years of advances in the safety of an enclosed space designed to keep you alive if it collides with something?
0 aren't largely at the hands of anyone other that cagers =are largely at the hands of cagers ?
1 No no no you misunderstand, I still have to change my pants when I finish my commute to work. 
4 >  You are far more likely to get into a crash in a car than in a motorcycle....Not by virtue of driving a motorcycle. Because there's more cars. >This means that driving a motorcycle is inherently safer than driving a car.No, it means there are less motorcycles on the road than cars, ergo, less accidents involving cars. Find me the stats on how many people live when a car hits their car at 50 MPH, then find me the stats for when a car hits a motorcycle at 50MPH. Same situation- car hits you. Very much not "inherently safer" on a motorcycle.>Again, I'll take my chances.Good for you, but using a derogatory slur because people *dare* to use the most convenient form of transportation known to the *universe* is fucking stupid 
3 *while commenting on a video of a dude nearly dying in a not uncommon way*
1 According to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 4,976 people died in motorcycle crashes in 2015 and 88,000 motorcyclists were injured. Motorcycles make up 3% of all motor vehicle registrations, only 0.6% of miles driven, but 14% of motor vehicle fatalities.By miles driven, motorcyclists have a 28 times higher fatality rate and 4.5 times higher injury rate.Source: https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812353
12 Yeah it's pretty clear that with the camera on top of your helmet and a wide angle lense we are seeing a lot more than you would've from your perspective.
2 Aye man you had no chance, just one of those cunty experiences! I trust you still ride ? Gotta get back in the horse and that ? 
2 Honestly man, don’t stress anyone criticizing. If they are, just simply imagine them being 400lbs and sitting on a motorcycle and immediately break the suspension because they are so far as they tell you “wow your reflexes and special awareness is poor”  
1 Well I mean, he IS Mr Science.Really though, it's cool you answering all these questions! Has the driver contacted you at all since it happened, or sent any flowers or beer or something?
2 When your life counts on it, such as riding a bike or motorcycle, you look both ways and "clear" an intersection before you enter it, green light or not. The dude in the video could had the green light but could have been killed. Can't enforce your rights and sue someone when you're dead. 
1 If you want to live and not get taken out by someone running a red, then you need to learn that green is a suggestion. Personally, I never go though a green light without looking both ways. There a big different between living and having the right of way. 
35 Not with that video evidence they won't.  They will offer the smallest amount of a settlement is possible, they won't spend time fighting this.
12 There’s video of a car running a red light and then the driver apologizing profusely...case closed. 
4 Not all the time, of course it helps that he has video of the accident. I mentioned my wife's accident above, and the lady who hit her immediately admitted fault to the officers on the scene and to us. When we talked to her insurance company they were extremely apologetic and helpful and assured us we'd not have to pay a cent out of pocket. I imagine if there had been any question of fault or the lady had been a jerk, it might have gone a different way. Poor thing was more worried about my wife's well being than her own though, definitely a good heart on her.
5 The way it works here in the states is you get money from your own insurance company for any damages and hospital costs. Then your insurance company pursues the cost with the other party's insurance company so you don't have to deal with any other insurance company. The only time this would be an issue is if you do not have insurance and need to work with the other person's insurance but that usually ends badly as they have the resources to give you the runaround.
1 Not really. Most insurance will settle than fight it.
1 What king of insurance are you using? American Family is pretty on top of getting money when you are not at fault (from my experience). are you talking about the car driver?

1 Funny, my ass hurts when I think about my youth. But I never broke my ass dirt biking. 
2 Na I mean it's been like 8 years since. He also knows where we live because the wreck was less than a mile up the road from our house. My mom had some pretty bad depression for awhile after. The guy lost his job because of it. She felt it was her fault. I mean it was but legally it wasn't. Pretty shitty time for us.

38 I dunno how much they'd appreciate that extended call time, but I can offer you some trail mix or a banana from the hospital EMS room. 
1 No foreplay... chivalry is dead
2 99% of the time.Honestly in most cases I ask if you would prefer me cutting them, or if you want to take the pain trying to take them off. Motorcyclists in leathers will take them off with a half severed leg before letting you cut them.It's only in "major traumas" and serious things that we procedurally cut everything off. Get shot? I'm cutting your clothes off. Break your leg? Your call on whether those jeans are important to you.
2 Non trauma. If you are having a heart attack we aren't cutting off your pants 
1 I mean, for 90% of car accidents, the complaint is minor neck pain, so we'd just slap a C-collar on you and put you on the stretcher. But a motorcyclist who's still on the ground when we get there with a couple moderate injuries is at least gonna have someone reaching for his trauma shears. If you make a big stink about it, yeah, most medics would probably consider pulling them off or just saying "fuck it" and documenting that the patient refused just to cover their ass. But yeah, depends on the medic and the severity of the situation. Despite protocols, much of EMS is making judgement calls like that. If you leave a little old lady with moderate abdominal pain and slightly-but-not-alarmingly off vitals at home because she just got out of the hospital for a fall and really doesn't want to go back again and she dies six hours later, you'd better be able to show that you used reasonable judgement and did everything in your power to convince grandma to get checked out.
2 Why are you getting upset and slinging shit at an entire populace if not out of ignorance and immaturity? 
2 I'm more immature than ignorant, thank you very much randomly angry internet person. "Bonnet" sounds funny to us because we associate it with a floral old-timey women's hat, deal with it. I also find it funny that my opinion of the word "bonnet" offends you. Do yourself a favour and go outside.Also I'm not a "he, " nor am I American, so... you know... you really botched that shit-slinging attempt. 
3 Are you being deliberately pedantic? There are plenty of people with any permutation of being smarter and/or more educated than you who say "hood".
21 There is a turn I have to make often that I often have to take as the light goes red (heavy traffic) and once in a while someone will run the red, stranding me in the middle of the lane while the other light goes green. The turn literally gets 1 person per light rotation, but the only other way is terrible
4 If you live in a busy city and stop at the beginning of yellows, you are going to cause an accident. If you see it turn yellow and know based on your position you'll be safely over the white line and into the intersection before the light turns red, you have a responsibility to the people behind you to go through. Otherwise, there would be 2-4 fewer cars through each and every light and it's just make traffic that much worse. 
1 In Sweden, the light on one direction of the intersection turns yellow, then turns red, then some seconds pass BEFORE the light turns yellow in the other direction. You can clearly see this happening because the cars horizontal to you will stop and be stopped for a bit before your light turns yellow.
1 Here in the UK there's a five second delay where both lights are red. Then one will turn amber. 
1 Correct - there is a 2 second delay on that light, and he entered the intersection 3 seconds after it turned green for me
1 Longer yellows are proven to be safer, and good design includes a 3-5 second delay where all lights are red 
1 There is supposed to be an all clear for the lights where they are all red afaik. That's in the US at least, not sure where this is.
0 There are situations where you would be in the intersection on a red. Mainly unprotected left turns, you are meant to pull out and wait until it's clear. Sometimes that isn't until the light turns red.That doesn't mean that you aren't going to be cited for running a red light but it does mean that there is a good reason to be cited for going on a green light when the intersection isn't clear.
1 It is possible to enter an intersection under a yellow and then the light turns red, and the other light turns green, before you have completely exited the intersection. It's all a matter of speed and size. 
5 That's the key, the guy was probably betting on it turning green (saw other side go red) and rolled into the intersection going very fast, which would make him the one at fault
4 Maybe reckless riders prefer black helmets...

20 Indeed. Don't be a meat crayon. 
1 Some friends I rode with were very adamant about how you never ride with just jeans. You can wear them under riding pants, but only wear jeans solo if you want to potentially have your entire leg skinned if you get in an accident. I figured they were right, even if exaggerating a bit. Then I had someone else I knew get a new bike and immediately crash it on a gravel road. They were wearing jeans, and holy hell their leg looked freaking terrible. 
1 There's also the great saying, "FUCK YOU I'M A SQUID I DO WHAT I WANT NEEEEEEEEEEE^EEEEE^EEEEE^EEE^E
3 I use A* airflow gear. Doesn't help in traffic and barely helps over 35C at freeway speeds, especially with a hot engine under you (1200cc twins are not made for summer riding)
1 Learned something new today. My brother in law is a SQUID. 
-7 Nah, I just believe that bikers should be treated like cars. Thanks for showing how mature you are, though.
1 BART, Muni, and bicycle all the way for me. Those are the only ways I'll go downtown.If I'm not near BART I'd rather get a Lyft to a BART station and take the train in than try to get a Lyft all the way into downtown in that mess of traffic.
1 When I used to take them more regularly while working very late, I noticed a lot of them come from out of town. Most were driving in from Sac or SJ and had no idea where anything was in SF. They would rely on the GPS, and still miss turns, miss exits, run lights, run stop signs, stop in the middle lane or in between the freeway lane and the off ramp to check the map, and sometimes and just get totally lost and drive in a circle. They're not paying attention to anything but the GPS, and are in a hurry to pick up riders, so they don't see what is happening around them. That's my assessment after riding them regularly for a few years and witnessing the insanity that they create on a daily basis. Whenever someone is parked in the middle of my street without pulling over, and blocking traffic in both directions, I assume it is Uber or Lyft. 9 out of 10 times it is. They also struggle to find addresses. My old office had the number address on it in three separate places and was one of two buildings on the block, yet they could never find it. Same thing with my home address. Huge numbers on the front of the building that are lit up at night, and shown on the GPS, and the drivers always stop a half block away. Don't even get me started with the casual carpool drop-off madness.
13 Bumpers? In the front and back of the car? We call them that too; unless your meaning is different. 
1 Wait, "indicators" is British now?  What are us Americans supposed to call them?

1 Hmm... I was wrong. That's apparently a motorcycle culture word for people in cars.
1 He would have destroyed me, my body wasn't working.   The exact moment I realized that was when I lifted my arm to point at my bike after he yelled at me to pull over haha.  I could barely walk for multiple days after the accident.
3 yes, got an upgrade out of it thanks to all the custom parts I had on it - luckily I had coverage for them on my policy.
1 How does he still have insurance? What kind of insurance does he have? I've only been in a couple of accidents but had to drop Geico because I couldn't afford $250 a month. Also my car had been totaled the last time, so I didn't even have a car to insure.
3 You are completely and 100% wrong.Even if you do everything 100% correctly, some drunk idiot could suddenly swerve from the other lane into you. You could be stopped at a red light and this happens even.Sounds like you had a bad lawyer, but that's likely contingent on you making a mistake in official statements. If you made some attempt to avoid the collision as you saw it coming, you would be at no fault. Alternatively, if like in the above video, a right turning car was blocking the vision until it was too late to do anything about it, you would also be found at no fault.For you to think that your anecdote suddenly means every accident is avoidable is naive. People are found at no fault in accidents all the time, sorry you weren't.
2 Yesss. That sounds way better when you word it like that lol. When lights go green there's potentially someone looking down still going or someone trying their luck. Nobody can watch out for you like you can.
2 Usually there is. I think there the light is partly at fault. It looked like it switch red/green at the same time.
2 My uncle is a  lieutenant.Good ones exist. These ones are not good ones. You never hear the story of a guy that does his job well.
1 Ok I agree that some bad cops exist but this is kinda hilarious trying to imagine a world without cops would basiclly be imaging a world with way mor fucking crime and shit.....bad cops exist but I doubt most of them want to kill the entire population of earth....
1 That doesn't mean you can consider anyone who is yelling to be physically threatening...especially not if you've given them good reason to yell.
1 Having rode the 675 and 675R, would you recommend the R over the other? I'm looking at both and I'm just not sure if the R is worth the extra cash

1 Hi friend! You may be mistaken here. Most motorcyclists I’ve met are actually very safe. However, far too many people use their phones while driving cars, especially at speed. I’ve seen this a *lot* since I started riding a motorcycle. A *lot*.That said, when a motorcyclist is careless (which does happen), he or she will suffer grave consequences...but most of the time, surrounding drivers will be relatively unharmed. When a driver in a car is careless (which happens way more than you’re admitting), a cautious motorcyclist in the line of fire will most likely be badly injured, if not killed.I had to chime in here because I’ve seen motorcyclists get a bad rap, and in my firsthand experience, it has absolutely not been the case. Most are safe.
8 Thank you for sharing that mental image.Weirdo.
4 > sounds like
8 Yup, which is why a lot of riders eventually stick to only riding at a track or only on dirt with as little on the street as posdible. Many racing riders will only ride for racing and refuse to ride on the street. Similar to how some race car drivers wont drive on public roads.
2 All it takes is one drunk asshole to kill you in your car as well. If you wear all your gear, practice aggressively defensive riding, and never touch a drop of drink when you're riding that day, you *significantly* reduce your chance of a crash. It's risky, but so is life. It's fun, but so is life. You make tradeoffs. Anybody on the fence, take your motorcycle safety course. See if you can resist after that ;) 
2 That's what heated gear is for :)
1 I'm sure the term "cager" is used with the utmost respect
1 I was actually planning on buying a motorcycle until I was sitting parked one day and some Uber driver rammed into me. I totally am on board with defensive driving but I wasn’t even moving! After that incident I realized I can’t leave my life vulnerable to the world’s morons.
2 They kinda bumble into your lane without signaling either.
2 Nah. You wouldn't be hard pressed to find 40 year veterans with no crashes or rolls off-track if you actually talked to some motorcyclists. 
9 They do.Some are just bad at math.
9 You could say the same about most drivers.

-2 These are pretty uncommon, by the definition of "common."

15 Correct.  The cab turning right on the red light blocked my view of him speeding down the street.  I didn't see him coming on my last check before going on the gas.
4 Yessir, I upgraded to a 675R, 1 year newer too.  Still ride every day.
2 I do find the agro guys funny, saying how they'd get up fighting.  Try getting hit by a car at that speed first lol.  Your body wont let you fight after that even if you wanted to.  Your body goes into protective survival mode - hard to explain - it just wont do what you tell it to do. 
1 No, he was from MA I believe, cops kept us separate at the scene, all I heard from was the insurance company.  Never heard from the guy again.  My total interaction with him is what is shown in the video.
1 True, but someone can sue on behalf of the dead.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/venus-williams-sued-family-man-dead-car-crash-n778701
1 I dont know if you live in the US, but yeah they will. insurances will literally fight anything. if you got  hit by someone on times square during new years eve, with it being shown across the world, the insurance will still fight it.
2 With that video, you'd have personal injury lawyers lining up to take your case on contingency.
1 Not always. I got rear-ended at a stoplight. I called the other person's insurance company and dealt strictly with them, not with my insurance company. Her insurance paid for damages to my car, rental car and lost wages for the 22 days I couldn't drive (I drive for Uber and Lyft). 10/10 would get hit again.
1 Oh wow, that height probably helped you here though, keep you from just slamming into the hood. I saw in another post you talking about your bike and it's attachment to you. Was there a particular reason this bike was so special, like reminding you of someone? Or was it just a really nice bike you put a lot of time, money, and effort into?

1 Hello, I'm a bot! The movie you linked is called **[Fast & Furious 9](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5433138)**,  here are some **[Trailers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Fast+&+Furious+9+Trailer )**
11 I made an EMT lol in 8th grade. I broke my arm sledding (went down standing up and hit a wooden kicker that had 0 snow left on it). It was in the middle of a blizzard so we called an ambulance. The EMT told me he had to cut off my sweatshirt and I said “noooo then Dan Marino will never get a ring...” I was wearing a Miami Dolphins sweatshirt. It was 2003.I was also delirious from the pain. I had completely snapped my humorous (no it wasn’t funny) about 2 inches away from my shoulder joint. My range of motion never recovered.
2 Thanks for the cool answer :)I mostly ask because I crashed a couple of months ago. No leg injury apart from tiny rash. Would have been pissed if they wanted to cut off my kevlar reinforced jeans :PThey did however insist on the rather pointless process of checking every part of me, because it's easy to not feel something with the adrenaline (or pain from other injuries). Turns out they were totally right because I didn't even notice the rash until they poked me in the knee.
1 Couldnt you injure yourself way worse trying to take off the pants tho?
0 it wasn't about saying hood instead of bonnet (he didn't even say "hood"), it was about him being immature and/or ignorant enough to laugh at an unfamiliar term.
2 Yup I know an intersection like it's really annoying but I think the way to handle it is to engage the turn so you're as far into it as you can get, and then complete the turnIt's on the guys who light just turned green to not enter the dangerous intersection 
1 you know if you report this to your local DoT they might do something about it. I have gotten several problem intersections worked on because despite what people think there aren't people monitoring every intersection in your town to optimize them. you have to tell them there is a problem or they will never fix it.
2 This I agree with. But you shouldn’t be gunning it to TRY to beat it. 
0 Idk if I agree, the only time I've ever seen a light switch that fast is for emergency vehiclesE: though it has just occurred to me switch times could be different in different places

1 I will never understand people who go out in flip flops and tank tops
1 If you like him then I'd suggest you recommend him to go take a Motorcycle Safety Course. Sure "I know how to drive a motorcycle" or "I've been riding dirt bikes since I was 6" are valid excuses but that doesn't teach you how to be safe on the road. Plus most courses will give him a permit to get the motorcycle endorsement on his driver's license assuming he doesn't have one. Sure, cars are simple to drive, but there's so much more to driving a car than just making it move forward/backwards/left/right. Bikes are the same way. According to the [Hurt Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report), 92% of riders involved in accidents had no training. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation offers an awesome Basic Rider Course program that teaches you all of the basics to ride a bike, and they offer lots of other courses if you'd like to improve your skills or learn some new tricks. https://www.msf-usa.org/Also suggest that he wears a helmet, assuming he doesn't already wear one. According to the [Hurt Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report), wearing a helmet *significantly* reduces the chance of head/neck injuries, and the report suggests that a lack of eye protection (visor, goggles, etc) is more likely to cause you to get in an accident because you're much less likely to see a problem before you can react to it. [RevZilla](https://www.revzilla.com) sells a lot of helmets and they've got a shitload of clearence/closeout all the time if he wants to get one that's relatively cheap. I personally use an HJC IS-Max 2 that cost about ~$180 and it's super comfy and you can open the face if you want to get some wind in your face, though there are a lot of quality options as low as $80.I personally would also recommend a jacket and/or gloves. You can get mesh jackets and breathable gloves for pretty cheap and armor padding is pretty nice to have if you don't want to break an elbow/shoulder/spine, and gloves are nice if you don't want to shred up the flesh on your hands and/or break your wrists/fingers.Riding pants and boots are debatable IMO. Yes they will definitely save your bacon in an accident, but what good is riding gear if it's sitting in your closet cause you're too lazy to spend 15 minutes gearing up? Gloves/jacket/helmet takes a minute to put on and they're by far the most likely to make a major difference on if you survive a crash or not. But for what it's worth, there are *plenty* of companies that make [riding jeans](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle-jeans) that look/feel like normal 'ol jeans but they're lined with kevlar and have knee armor pads (and some have pockets or options for hip/tailbone armor) to protect you in a crash. They're not quite as cheap as standard jeans at $65+/pair but it's up to the rider if their life is worth more than $65.
3 Wait a minute. Bikers don't have privileges. What are you talking about? And running a red light with after something like 3 or 4 seconds is seriously considered dangerous driving (if the driver was just day dreaming it might be more excusable). But you're right when saying that the fact the car hit a bike don't make it "more" illegal. 
1 That’s what I suspected. It’s already chaotic for people used to the city but even more so for the drivers who don’t routinely visit there. And they’re not professional drivers, just your average person so I don’t blame them but they can create some unnecessary issues.

1 Oh, so that's like REALLY you in the gif? 
1 Trust fund child who lives frugally 
1 R is worth it in my opinion, the brakes, suspension, and quickshifter are a huge, noticeable upgrade.
7 Dumb and dumber! My all time favourite movie. 
2 I tried, then gave up realizing if I made any mistake I would burn up ~$1,500 clutch.  Ended up trailering the bike to the shop and had them finish the job.  Realized cost of work would be low considering I had it torn down already.  I also forgot to order the gasket and was to eager to ride it so I wanted a quick turn around instead of waiting on bikebandit to ship it.
4 Why do you care, though, when it doesn't affect anyone?
10 Yeah.  Tell me about it.  After I showed them the footage they cited him for running the red light.  They also officially determined fault while we were still on scene after we reviewed the footage from the camera.
2 Definitely less bikers texting/snapchatting/eating than drivers. At any given point, there’s like a 50/50 chance someone’s doing one of those three when you look in the windows. Much lower odds of seeing a biker doing the same. 
2 Some race car drivers don't drive on public roads? The fuck
5 Sure, it's also possible to get killed in a car, but it's delusional to think that it's safer to be in a crash on a motorcycle vs in a car. You can make things a lot safer, but all driving/riding skills equal, a car will just be safer.Of course in the end, it all comes down to personal choice. I've just decided that it isn't a risk which I am willing to take. I totally respect those who ride safely, though. I'll just keep myself happy with my road bike.
1 I would say the rear view mirrors are the most used piece of equipment on my bike next to the throttle.
1 This infuriates me whether I'm in my car or on my bike. In my car I "panic" and blare my horn and act like they're about to fucking end my life, because that's about what happens to me on my bike when people pull this shit. 
2 Dude, I got that from a motorcyclist.  The rational ones know that an accident will happen.  That's why wearing protective gear at all times is so important. 
1 It's simply *not in your control*.  Managed risk my ass, I'm not gonna  die for free because some shit-ass kid is texting.  I understand that this is true to a certain extent in cars, too, but we both know its an order of magnitude difference.
1 2.4% is a higher number, yes. But "percentage of crashes among individual cars is higher than percentage of crashes among individual motorcycles" is not a statistic that fucking relates to *safety*, genius. You are not, I repeat, you are *not* "inherently safer" completely exposed on a motorcycle than inside a car. You are simply not. There is nothing protecting you.Less crashes, more violent trauma and death per crash.
3 And how many of those motorcycle crashes are fatal or cause someone to breathe out of tube for months? Compare that to someone who gets tapped on their bumper and has a sore neck for a week. If someone were to hit me at 20mp/h in my car from behind, I’d most likely have some whiplash and go to physio for a few months. Get hit at 20mp/h with no protection on a bike? Lucky to still know how to walk after. But hey, I just hope you’re an organ donor. :)
1 Good good dude ;) gotta hit and run 2 Year’s ago still ride almost every day! Winter setting in over here in the UK so it’s cold as balls haha
1 Did the insurance companies do right by you? 
1 psh.. what a douche
1 Of course, that happens all the time. Where there is money...
3 I saw him with enough time to roll my shoulder over as I hit the windshield, which is why, I believe at least, I ended up doing a barrel roll in addition to the flip.  Bike was special because I put roughly 100 hours into customizing it, detailing it, waiting weeks for parts to show up, etc. etc.  Just a lot of hard work I had literally just completed after buying that bike.  I sold my previous Daytona and bought the one in the video a few months earlier.
2 same.

1 Have you or a loved one been bamboozled? Try out one of our great bamboozle insurance policies and never worry about being bamboozled ever again!
1 Buy me gold and I shall bamboozle you a third time.
1 I mean...he was pretty clearly murdered by Kylo in the last documentary 
1 Han shart first!
3 Ha, that's pretty good for a middle schooler. Hopefully you were also delirious from some of them goodass pain meds. 
1 When I broke my neck horseback riding they had to undress me. Luckily my top was a button up so no harm there but I was wearing my absolute favorite bra at the time and made them carefully reach around back to unclip it rather than cut it off. In hind sight it was stupid. But I kept that bra for years! 
1 The truth is this varies widely based off of the experience and competence of the paramedic you pull.In rural places you might have an EMT/firefighter (~one month of training EMT and one or so more fire) who is a volunteer and runs one call a month. They are more likely to practice "by the book" and cut your stuff off.If you are in a major city you will probably get a full time professional paramedic (several years of emergency medical training.) Chances are that person has seen enough to know when clothes need to come off and not.Obviously we would never try to save clothes at the risk of damage, but like you said, a lot of people don't mind some pain in a broken arm or something to save their leathers. I wouldn't be pissed at EMT's who cut them off, it's in the book, but it's nice to consider for sure. 
2 Not really. I mean, sure, in the rare case that it's some insane injury we are going to cut them off. But if you're leg is just pointing the wrong direction it's no more damaging than the process of bandaging and splinting. I wouldn't grab it and swing it around...But, when guys tell me they want me to save their leathers and I tell them it's going to hurt, they almost always say that's fine. lol.
1 For mine, luckily the traffic is heavy enough that there is always someone waiting and you can't speed through it.

1 [What, like this guy?](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/BrilliantBlaringHogget) EDIT: FFS Reddit, it's just the Harley Wobble Video that's been making the rounds lately. Nobody dies, just a guy not in ATGATT sliding.
1 Bikers can 10% drive in ways that cars are not allowed to, that's a privilege
1 I'd argue that they are below average drivers. 
2 Ah! On the front sides over the wheels?
1 It's any easy mistake since we call very minor accidents (such a bumper to bumper) "fender benders".
5 Fenders are on the front sides - over the wheels.
3 No, fenders are something different. They are typically the curved pieces of metal that go over a wheel/tire. Most cars don't have them. Most bikes do. 
1 Yes, we do call them "turn indicators" when speaking of them in technical terms, but "blinkers" colloquially. 
1 Yes, that's really me.
0 MFW I laugh at a joke I already heard 
5 They should pay you triple damages for being fraudulent assholes. 
2 I never claimed it was safer. I said you're taking a calculated risk getting in a car OR a motorcycle, and smart people augment those calculations by defensive driving / wearing gear. After that's done, you calculate other factors - MPG, speed to destination, parking availability at destination, cost of parking at destination, fun of journey to destination, and choose the option that best fits your risk/reward equation. Considering that I can lanesplit and cut the time of my commute in *half*, get *free* parking at the *door* wherever I go, have a blast doing it, and that girls *love* getting on the back of it, the motorcycle is more than worth the risk. for me. It's not for you, and that's fine. If I had a child, I probably wouldn't do it off-track, for example. 
2 Yea, I assumed you were a motorcyclist, because I hear adages like that all the time from older riders. We have ABS now. We wear our gear. Our tires  and bikes are better and we know not to drink and ride. Things have changed and so I'm naturally defensive against old-man-motorcycle adages. Demonstrably, the hobby has become significantly safer. 
1 How is that not managed risk? Do you see me claim anywhere that the risks of a motorcycle is not higher? Are you denying that there are behaviors that can make a motorcycle less or more risky? I also skydive. Will you berate me for my hobbies? What if I was a competitive boxer?  A kite surfer? A *regular* surfer? Life is managed risk. Nobody is forcing you to ride a motorcycle. 
1 California is year round riding weather, don't hate.
1 Yeah I got paid out - had to chase the guy down though, he was driving his girlfriend's dad's car.  The insurance they provided was for the car issued to the dad, but he was the one driving it so it took awhile to track down his policy as he refused to call my carrier back.  My carrier eventually just covered it and went after him for collections.  I have no idea if they ever got it or not.
1 To be fair that's probably the smartest move he could do in the situation. The last thing you want to do is admit fault (even though he clearly was in the wrong) and let the insurance companies sort it out.
1 Impressive and depressing at the same time on both accounts. Glad you ended up alright, as I'm sure you are too. Also can't imagine how weird it is for his to suddenly pop back into your life.

1 Annnnd there it is.
1 Fuck all of you guys.
1 The rare triple bamboozle!
1 When will it end?!
1 My response was to say "oh my god, I fucking hate everyone" out loud. I'm sitting alone outside my house and a little old lady was strolling by while walking her dog. She is not pleased. 
1 Fuck you guys and your bamboozles. Here is ACTUAL footage from another angle that was linked in the youtube comments. [Slightly potato quality security cam at the same intersection.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
2 god yeah. I was given perc 10s! My mom told me that I was getting furious (after getting home from the hospital later that evening) with her because I kept demanding she make me scrambled potatoes. She didn’t know if I wanted scrambled eggs or mashed potatoes so being the fucking greatest mom ever that she was, she made me both. Then I got mad at her because she “gave the dog the tv remote.” That was my very first time being fucked up. It’s also what taught me that I have a very low tolerance for opioids. Probably what spared me from a life of addiction, ultimately. When I got older and all my friends started fucking around with PKs but I knew they were just going to make me crazy itchy and insane/miserable. Was reinforced when I got my appendix out on my 16th birthday and I had similarly insane experiences from the pks.
1 Haha thanks for the info and thanks for what you do.

2 Same. lloydvomiting.gif
5 If only it worked that way.
2 Oh, I must have partially misread your comment then.I totally get those other factors. The reduction of commute seems especially convenient.
5 The point is no matter what you drive, statistically speaking you will crash at some point.  
2 I dont give a fuck how good you are on your bike, how sober you are this ride, how youre wearing all your gear. Youre not invincible, and all it takes is one car not seeing you to throw all your safety shit out the window and smash you dead.
1 There are too many factors though to consider. My brother-in-law, who not only took classes for improved riding skills, he wore all gear and kept his bikes in tip-top shape. He was rear-ended twice, both at red lights by drivers who weren't paying attention. The second one broke his back.In some areas I probably watch my mirrors too much when stopped, and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to avoid a person who is fully focused on their texting coming up behind me. Some offenses I think really require that the driver's license be removed permanently (texting and driving, drinking and driving over legal limit). A driver's license is not an inherent human right.
1 Kinda feel like you ignored the order of magnitude part of my comment.[ Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists' risk of a fatal crash is 35 times greater than a passenger car.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_safety).I took one elbow too many to the head training in muay thai and decided I couldn't control whether that was really going to happen any more if I kept up training the way I was.  I've jumped too. It was awesome! By the way..[According to the United States Parachuting Association, there are an estimated 3 million jumps per year, and the fatality count is only 21 (for 2010). That's a 0.0007% chance of dying from a skydive, compared to a 0.0167% chance of dying in a car accident (based on driving 10,000 miles). In layman's terms, you are about 24 times more likely to die in a car accident than in a skydiving one.](https://www.seeker.com/how-common-are-skydiving-accidents-1765419215.html)I'm not saying people shouldn't be allowed to ride bikes, I think they are rad as fuck.  But you are, objectively, disregarding your own life to do so, and a lot of people would agree that this is stupid as hell.
1 I hated riding in the summer this year, something about 90° moist air hear blasting my balls I guess. But SF is colder in the summer so that ought to help.

2 HA! HA! No, that's the thing between the two front seats.
1 Thanks, happy to be alive.  I got married last year, best day of my life, glad I had an opportunity to make it happen.

1 That movie sold me on Carrey though. 
2 Yea, we're not disagreeing, I just like getting laid more than you ;) Totally kidding. It rains. Cars are good. 
1 In statistics, the words "will" and "guaranteed" do not exist.

All it takes is one mugging, one lightning strike, one poorly chewed piece of steak, one bad throw in your boxing practice, one drunk driver, one north korean missile, one disturbed terrorist with a gun, one....Life is risk management. I risk a little more than you for some gains. Does this anger you? I'm not making you ride a motorcycle. Nobody is. Still a free country :) 
1 My grandmother was an advocate and member of MADD - mothers against drunk driving. She was killed by a drunk driver. Personal allegories are kind of pointless. That being said I agree with your point about licenses - fuck do I get nearly pegged by old people way too often.

1951 That popcorn smell is a byproduct of yeast and bacteria! Saw that recently somewhere else on reddit...

499 inb4 someone says your dog has a terminal illness due to its popcorn odor
45 Super cute, what breed of dog is he?
41 Maybe he’s a binturong.
36 I'm gonna need more pictures of this Very Good Popcorn Boy!!
15 Hmm.  My beagle always smells like a hamster/similar.
24 My dog smells like Doritos, I don’t really enjoy Doritos anymore.
7 What breed of dog is this? I have a pound puppy with a very strong similar look. Would love to know.

6 What a beauty.
8 I wish my dogs smelled like popcorn. They just smell like regular dogs.
5 F O X Y B O Y E
13 I wonder if it’s similar to the phenomenon of some dog paws smelling like fritos. Or he is the mythical Popcorn Dog of yore sent forth to heal the world. 
18 Popcorn smell is a bacterial/yeast infection, but it should be harmless
5 I suspect your dog has been getting into the popcorn.
4 He is a good boy. 
6 A fox and a hound 
7 *looks around confused-like*That... that's a fox
4 That looks like a dog with an extremely high intellect!!

3 Looks even more like a dhole! [Because of the snout shape and smaller ears](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cuon_alpinus_alpinus.jpeg)
3 INB4 someone comes along and explains why popcorn smell means the dog is dying and the owners are horrible people.
3 Switch to dog food that's no corn/soy/wheat. The smell is from bacterial or yeast infections in dogs that can't process the dog food that's not meat based. Some dogs (like mine) eventually will chew their fur out because of itching, or chew their feet pads raw. 
3 They say the popcorn smell is a bacteria that is on their paws. Forgot the name though but it’s not harmful and should be cleaned
3 I'm coming over to pet your dog.. address and a good time to come by, please.

1010 > The corn chip odor — which some human noses interpret as more of a popcorn scent — is a byproduct of yeast and bacteria, Dr. Robert J. Silver, a Colorado-based veterinarian, told The Huffington Post.Jul 24, 2015Edit:> > While the smell is perfectly normal, Silver said that it can sometimes be a sign of infection. If your pooch is excessively licking his feet, his paws are greasy or there is inflammation in the webbed part between his toes, you might want to take a trip to the vet.

3 An aside;  I could tell when my retriever would get ear infections because of the popcorn smell.  It might be worth getting the pup checked out.
3 Yea my cats smells like popcorn sometimes even after bathing them to get any lose fur off.
6 I’ve never had a dog that didn’t have frito foot, I believe it’s just their smell 
2 Yep. IIRC, it's also referred to as "Frito feet" because their toes smell like Fritos chips.
2 Then what makes my dog smell like Doritos?
2 Wait...wha...is it the same for cats? Because our cat has the most delicious smell on her paws. My daughter says it smells like popcorn while to me its like freshly baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon (no kidding) Kitty also loves to pat our faces with her tiny pinky paws and we love it. Is this something we better not be doing? Can those bacteria be harmful?

2 My dog's breath always smells like fish...I wonder if that is normal. She does not eat fish.
1 SCOBY-doby-dooooo!!!
1 dammit reddit
1 Great. Thanks. Every time I go to the movies it's going to remind me of yeast and bacteria.
1 POTATOES!If your dog’s feet smell like Fritos and/or they lick their paws and/or have chronic ear infections, try a grain free food that is also free of potatoes.
1 I wonder if that's why Binturongs smell like popcorn.
1 I always thought my dogs smelled like tortillas...
1 Whose going to tell him -not me.
-2 can confirm, my sweaty balls smells like popcorn at the end of the day

34 Could be a sign of bacteria or yeast on their paws, not really life threatening but could be the cause.
6 We did it Reddit!!!
110 He’s a mix of a few things. Definitely part Pomeranian and part Jack Russel. The lady we adopted him from said he was “part wolf” though I have my doubts haha!
7 Came here to make this comment, glad I wasn't the only one.
9 Ah, the smell of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.
1 Thanks Jack Hannah! 
59 Well here you are my fellow dog lover :)https://ibb.co/eESOKb

20 do hamsters smell like ham
6 So does mine. My husband tells me I'm weird for saying she smells like doritos. But she does!
1 I thought I'd be the only one here who does as well xD. 
1 I always said Cheetos for mine. Same snack family, I'm sure it's a similar smell.I^happen^to^love^it...
10 At first we thought he was a miniature Sheltie. We have since found out that his mother is part Pomeranian (he has the coat and the bushy tail) and his father is a Jack Russell. Great temperament on him, so I think it’s a good breed whatever it is. He’s 4 years old and small/medium in size, about 8 kg. Best of luck with your puppy, I’ve no doubt he or she will make you really happy!

5 Our chihuahua sometimes smells like fritos.We even have a cute way of telling him he does."YEW SMELL Like DA Freeeeeeeetoooooes!" then we smell his face and he gets nervous.
2 Weird definition of infection you have there. 
3 What did you just call me??
1 My doggo had this smell too. Miss him.
1 No, he go woof.
1 Nah.  My dog always smells like popcorn too.
497 Is that a problem, or is it okay? My pup's paws always smell like fritos
49 Yeah, that was the first source I saw from as well. I was trying to find the post I saw it in.. ah well! Thanks!
4 Hm.  I wonder if that has to do with dry food and the carbohydrates within.  The vet told me to take my cat off of dry food because cats aren't supposed to have that many carbs.  Does anyone know if that's similar for dogs?  Yeast wouldn't do too well with a low carb environment.
2 That "Fritos" odor my wife's dog gave off was also a sign that her terrier/dachshund mix needed a bath.
1 -Michael Scott
1 My dog does this. He gets yeast infections in his ears and they often spread to his paws. Imagine a yeast infection between your toes :/
1 My dog smells Fritos
1 >remember where they’ve been  Why would a dog want it?
1 hockey bag smell!
1 My dog smells like celery salt to me. Any thoughts on that?
243 That's why they called him Scoby Doo
1 Yeah, but in this case your pupper is the one being made into sludge.
1 I think I drank kombucha once. Not that I prepared some kombucha tea, but that I took a sip of some month old arizona green tea and slurped down half a jellyfish. 
72 One of my clients is a beagle-basset mix who has just the right amount of corn chip smell. It's the main reason I keep working with him, I'd never tell his family but I'd work with him for free and just get paid in the ability to sniff him all I want.
68 I loved smelling our dogs paws.. it's addictive! Like the newborn smell you get from baby's heads.
4 http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-smells-bad-fritos-stinky-feet-what-causes-foot-odor-in-dogs-yeast-infectionIt’s fine but if too much can indicate issues.
1 What kind of dog is that? He looks just like my little mutt!! =O
6 Thanks for the suggestion, but we don't currently have any furry friends running around our house. A couple of years ago, when we still had a Bernese and a Black Lab, we switched them to a raw meat + veggies diet. They absolutely loved it! Huge difference in their coats and skin, too.
1 Recommendations on a cheap grain free food to order online?  Would like to try this for my dog since he sometimes chews on his feet a bit much. 
1 I don't see any reason to use an anti-fungal shampoo unless your dog has a specific fungal overgrowth and it's recommended by a vet. Yeast/fungus growth on ours and our dogs' bodies is typically part of a healthy biome which can keep detrimental infections at bay.
1 Tail Ale?    Snout Stout?
1 We describe our dog's smell as 'biscuity' too!
9 You wash your cats? 😮     http://coub.com/view/106ff
1 My cats smell like Biscoff cookies.  No clue why.
3 Yep, completely natural.    From the article:  >Pseudomonas and proteus are the two types of natural bacteria that make their way from soil or water into the crevices of a paw, and it's the former that gives your pet that snack food smell.
1 Same thing I guess. Doritos are made from corn.
1 Our yorkie’s breath smelled like that, and it was indicative of bad oral hygiene. He needed a couple teeth pulled, and it’s gone away entirely! That may be the issue.

1 I don't like this thread anymore
3 Came here to say this
1 Dr. Dre on the mic over here 
52 Our guy looks just like him. We've decided he's part Shetland Sheeprdog most definitely. We're actually getting him a genetics test for Christmas...can't believe I admitted that.
7 He’s adorable :) my doggo is similar except more chihuahua than jack. [Here is a photo of him after he murdered his toy](http://imgur.com/nEBaVH4)
2 A wolf? Really? I have no idea what part of him she sees as wolf. She sounds like a wacky lady!
1 Looks half Corgi, half Shetland Sheepdog. I'm no expert though. I just have 2 Shetland Sheepdogs.
1 Looks like he has some sheltie in there too
1 Haha she’s not wrong! All dogs are part wolf, even if it’s a teeny tiny amount :)
27 This might be one of the cutest dogs I have ever seen. 
14 Please sir/miss can I have another?? He's adorable!
7 That is weapons grade cute right there. OMG, OP, we need moar.
3 He looks like a mini-version of my mutt! Same tail/similar ears and coloring: https://i.imgur.com/orvlod6.jpg
5 If they did, I'd own several.
5 Maybe he has frito feet. Could be diet or hygiene. 
1 We are not alone!
3 My dog looks similar too!  She was a stray from a shelter, though, so we don't know what she is.  I think ours has longer legs though
1 My mom's chihuahua used to smell like fritos if she'd been outside playing or not had a bath in a few weeks. My current chihuahua just stinks when she hasn't had a bath. Like, idk what she gets into or does, but it's rank. 
1 > then we smell his face and he gets nervous.Aren't those types of dogs always nervous?
2 Idk, but I like it. New PG insult. 
1 Your parents too?
391 it can cause some irritation and make them lick their paws a lot and sometimes chew. My dachshund had frito foot for years and is now in a cone because he chewed one of his feet up so much. Not sure if it's directly related to frito foot, but it's worth noting. He used to lick his paws a lot. It's hard to get rid of. Diet and anti-fungal foot soaks can help a lot though.
54 WTF. My wife and I were watching my mom's dog for about a year and my wife always said "he smells like fucking Fritos," and I never could smell it. I'll be damned.
31 We call it fritoes. Ours seems to be fine but he licks them a lot. Hell he licks everything a lot. 
8 My vet said to clean my dogs ears when they smell like doritos. I think she meant fritos.
1 What other people said.Also check their ears for more wax than looks normal. A yeast infection in ears (untreated and extreme) can damage a dog's hearing over time.Source: My pit had one ear that was nearly black.
1 We just call our chiweenie puppy Leia by one of two names:Corn Chip or Hot Dog
1 Do you have fritos on the floor?
1 From what I have heard, it is relatively normal to describe the smell of your dog's paws as "popcorn-ish / smelling like fritos" BUT if the odour is very prominent you should get it checked out.
1 We’ve always said our yorkie sometimes smelled like rice and Doritos as a joke. TIL!
1 More like fritos smell like your pup's paws
1 Are you sure it's fritos and not nacho cheese doritos?
1 That's a sure sign of yeast. Does your dog constantly lick it's paws?Honestly it might not end up being a huge problem.  However, for my dog, if she gets a yeast buildup, it's almost guaranteed she'll end up with a UTI.I give her probiotics in her food and dip her paws in a water/vinager mix if I notice that she is licking them more than usual.We battled UTI's with her for a while so we have to take preventative measures when it comes to yeast buildup.
1 I thought my dog was the only one! I always call her frito paws 😂😁
1 Our dog had some yeast issues so we switched her over to grain free food with no sweet potatoes.  It's super high carb and used in most dog foods.  Cleared her up pretty quick.   
1 I don't think the carbs you eat spill directly out onto the surface of your skin... The only carb travelling around inside your body is blood glucose, which is maintained regardless of your intake (carnivores will make their own).
1 Cats and dogs are way different in diet. One is a carnivore that evolved eating rodents we attracted with farming. The other evolved on the scraps of garbage and approval we gave it. 
1 Yeah my guy is only a Corn Chip Boy when I'm slacking on the baths lol.
-4 Awwtistick
35 *slow clap*
7 I'm for real not trying to be a smart ass here, is that what they call the disk of yeast or whatever, the "mother dough" of this stuff?
1 kombucha-based humour, I like it
22 I wish my vet was this honest. Just telling me all the weird shit they do. She'd look at me like I was crazy if I walked in and said "How often do you just smell the dogs feet?"
4 Id like to imagine that you're a lawyer or a contractor and that the dog has hired you
3 Yep, had two bassets and they definitely had the frito sent.  It improved with a food change, but never would entirely go away.  I miss those slobbery stinking dogs. 
1 My beagle-mix had a wonderful, mild popcorn smell that I very much enjoyed.
88 My dog pees on his front leg, so no thank you.He got the leg hike right, but doesn't turn enough. If he goes by the fence, he is good, but any other thing he tries to mark, he misses a soaks his ankle. 
40 We call them frito feet
8 This is getting weird.
6 I like to smell my dogs head, right behind his ears. It kind of a subtle version of puppy scent.
4 I love smelling my dog's paws too. It's a really calming, comforting smell. Seems to be the most prominent when she's sleeping. My husband think's it's gross but I don't care!
8 My wife calls it puppy crack. I think it's fitting.
3 Nothing like yeast and dog bacteria. 
3 We always called it 'popcorn paws' on our corgi. 
4 I have a little Norfolk terrier and her paws always smell like corn. It is so addicting to hold her tiny little paws and get a little sniff. 
2 glad im not alone...
-6 Dog asses smell the best. Give that a shot, I guarantee you won't regret it. And your dog will think you care. To them it's like a handshake. 
-1 Fucking nasty...
7 My dog has been on the raw food diet since he was born, yet the corn chip smell has always been there...
2 We use Nature's Recipe.  It's at Walmart, and on Amazon Prime and Chewy.  Our pup likes the salmon, pumpkin and sweet potato and it's grain free and easy to digest.
1 Taste of the Wild too!
2 We started them when they were kittens. We don't do it often,maybe every few months.
3 My cat usually has zero smell. Guess that means I'm doing something right....or wrong.
2 Cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa always smelled like grape jelly and tortillas to me. It's also mildly fluorescent under a UV lamp. 
1 Is it something to worry about?
1 Good to know. I will see what I need to do. The vet has never commented on her teeth, but I have also never specifically asked.
53 *The quick brown fox vpajamas the lazy dog.*
3 You're da real mvp
2 That's pretty good. 
5 Hmm... it just might work
30 - Dolly is old news. They have been cloning dogs for years.  There’s currently a triplet set of dog clones named [Snuppy](https://i.imgur.com/gYarAvB.jpg) in Seoul.   You can get your dog cloned for ~100k but no guarantees that temperament will be the same.  There’s some nature / nurture there that can’t be cloned. 
2 Don’t remove the popcorn gene just make it harmless so it can still smell like popcorn and not have any bad issues
23 My gf got one done for her adopted dog.  The one she got was really in depth with the analysis and included possible traits that answered the reason why he was having seizures earlier in the year.  10/10 would get done again on another pup.
8 We are getting paintings of our dogs so... no judgments here.
4 As a guy with 2 Shetland Sheepdogs, I can say that the nose and eyes are similar. Color matches as well. Got something of a corgi when it comes to ears and paws.
1 Definitely looks part sheltie - the most adorable breed!!
1 I thought he looked like a sheltie too! I have a little sheltie mutt :) scrolled looking for the breed convo lol
3 Bathing in his enemies insides. Metal.
2 I agree I agree I want!!!!! You’re extremely lucky OP. 
1 Nope.  Just my dog.  I always thought it was weird.
157 Warm vinegar and water in a bowl is a great home-made anti-Frito concoction.  Just have them soak their paws for a few minutes each.  Edit:  actual recipe for those who are interested:1 cup of organic apple cider vinegar  1 cup of hydrogen peroxide  1 gallon of warm water  Soak your dog’s paws in the liquid for 30 - 90s and allow the skin to air-dry.  You'll want to keep your pup from walking around with wet paws too for obvious reasons. 
3 I mean, I'd be liking my paws if they smelled like fritos. It's like getting Cheetos dust on your fingers.
3 If my hands tasted like popcorn, I'd probably need a cone, too.
2 On the other hand, I've owned dachshunds my entire life (was literally born into a family that owned them) and they've all always had frito feets. Never any chewing or anything. Lots of unbearable cuteness, but no feet-chewing.
1 All dachs my family owned licked their paws to their death, never noticed anything unusual about them, the last one which is around 1 year old is already doing it.
1 An over abundance of yeast and bacteria do cause itching. Also, some dogs have this cool thing where they lick their feet when they’re bored or anxious. 
1 Is it obvious more than licking paws? My corgi licks his a lot, and each time I've taken him to the vet, they gave him hydroxizine (sp?). This is the first I've heard about this.
1 My dachshund's feet have smelled like Fritos for years.  He never really licks at them. It's just what they smell like.  I like them.
1 I totally read “dachshund” as HusbandI need coffee 
1 My feet smell like this quite often. Can confirm, I do lick them a lot. Does not taste like popcorn.
1 I read "dachshund" as "husband" at first and got very confused.
1 Please come to r/dachshund and show us! 
1 Dachshund paws and most dog paws will smell like this naturally. =)
-5 can't you like have your dog dip their paw in hydrogen peroxide then hold their paws away from their snouts until they kind of dry, then wash said paws in water so the pupper won't poison itself later when grooming?
6 lol
-13 > he smells like fucking FritosClassy lady!
11 I think she meant let's all throw up now.
0 Never trust a skinny vet.
2 No problems with his ears. Just when you sniff his paws really close
1 I call my guy Corn Chip Boy lol
25 "A kombucha culture is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), similar to mother of vinegar, containing one or more species each of bacteria and yeasts, which form a zoogleal mat[23] known as a "mother.""
16 Yes, "scoby" is an acronym for "symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast"
53 My sister is a vet. She will go on and on about how this dog or that dog has frito feet and they smell SOOO good. Then when I'm over her house she's always smelling her dog's feet. It takes a special person to be a vet, they are fuckin weird.
1 I have a basset. I can send you jars of slobber. 
43 Goddamn my guy does this as well sometimes.  Bruh, don't you feel hot pee hitting your leg?
9 My dog thinks eating bugs is a sport. His breath smells as bad as you think it would.
17 Frito feetos over her :)
3 We've only just begun... ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
2 So much yes! Our Labs had the puppy scent their whole lives :)
1 I had a book that clearly specified that this is the **best** place to smell a dog. 
0 Lol your wife likes puppy PAWSterior
6 Oh yeah, it's natural.     From the article:  >Pseudomonas and proteus are the two types of natural bacteria that make their way from soil or water into the crevices of a paw, and it's the former that gives your pet that snack food smell.
1 My doggy is pampered but one thing I don't do is brush his teeth :(. He is eating grain free now. He now has a popcorn smell emanating from his mouth. That smell was never there before switching to grain-free.
1 Much appreciated! 
1 I don't think so. Someone up above said something about changing their diet if it's bothering you but I think it's a natural thing that some dogs get but it's not harmful.
16 We did it reddit!
3 "I'm walkin' on sunshine!" 
4 For some reason this kinda freaks me out. Just imagine being cloned when you’re young then running into yourself years down the road. Trippy. 
1 That actually sounds appealing to me (not that I have $100k) - my dog has anxiety & dementia and I've always wondered if part of it is because he stayed with my asshole father (who I am about 90% sure was abusive to him) while I was in college. I know it wouldn't be the same dog, but what if I could go back and save 'him' all that pain?
1 Congratulations /u/Xoduszero!  You have been promoted to Quality Assurance Team Leader.  
2 What was the brand? I'm doing this soon.
1 That sounds cool, do you recall which kit? I know there are ones that are more accurate and more in depth than others.
207 Bonus: you get Frito-flavored vinegar to use for cooking afterwards!
12 My dog licks her paws constantly, does this really work? Apple cider vinegar or regular white vinegar? What ratio?
7 I would never want the frito smell to go away
3 3% hydrogen peroxide.food grade 35% will burn your dog's foot off.
2 In case some one *doesn't* know one of the obvious reasons is that it will bleach your floors and your couch and cloths... and your dog! 
2 If it isn't organic vinegar will it kill my dog?
1 What about head and shoulders?
1 If I am going to clean my dog's feet, I mine as well give her a bath. I use dog shampoo with tea tree oil in it when the smell gets over whelming. In the winter, she gets an oatmeal conditioner. She tends to get greasy in the summer though, and conditioner will just make it worse. 
1 Would this be good as a preventative measure? Like a once-per-week soak?
1 man i read vinegar and peroxide and all I could think of was [a solution people make to dissolve lead from firearm silencers](http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/07/05/the-dip-a-toxic-mixture-used-to-clean-silencer-parts/). so looks like if you dilute it enough it wont hurt your puppers fets?
1 but who doesn't love a good Frito Pie?
4 Geez, ruff way to go.*I'll see myself out...*
3 Peroxide is antifungal but I don't think it's the best option.  But neither is vinegar like others are suggesting.  If your doggo is having fungus issues, it's best to talk to a vet, so you don't accidentally injure your pup.Edit to add:  I don't think it's right to downvote someone for asking an innocent question.   There was nothing wrong with asking, especially since Peroxide IS anti-fungal. 
2 Classiest broad ever.

1 Ugh my chihuahua/miniature pinscher mix has long twiggy legs like stilts and just *cannot* figure out how to pee without hitting his front legs. It does at least seem to bother him and he does a sort of dance to try to get out of it, poor guy

2 The real LPT is *always* in the comments
0 *hurk*
11 We've done it with our pupper a few times because she chews on her paws/nails when the smell gets to a certain point.  It definitely seems to reduce the smell a fair amount (and it's not just covering it up with a vinegar smell). I'll edit my comment with the recipe (it seems I missed a key ingredient).
5 She might have a mild food sensitivity or allergy, that can cause the popcorn/frito smell and licking/chewing too.  I work in a pet store and smell a lot of dogs feet (I can't eat cheese popcorn anymore). If she does have a sensitivity, chicken is the cause more often than not.  If there is any chicken in her food/treats, maybe try going to a no-chicken (at all, no chicken fat, no meal) or limited-ingredient diet (single protein/single carb) to see if it helps.
2 Here's a great site with some great recipes for paw treatments, including ones with vinegar: http://ottawavalleydogwhisperer.blogspot.ca/2012/04/natural-remedies-for-dogs-cats-with.html
1 My lab/sharpei had terrible skin when I adopted...for bacterial and fungal there is Malaseb shampoo. Works wonders. Doc specifically told me to make sure I get it into her paws cause it's a problem spot. https://www.chewy.com/malaseb-medicated-shampoo-dogs-cats/dp/119233
6 Oh it doesn't go away completely, just stops the itch and irritation that can come along with it.  My dog chews her nails and sometimes they bleed so this helps her a lot with that.  
2 Yeah, first aid-grade H2O2 (except don't use it for actual open wounds because it's sort of useless at best and damaging at worst).
2 nah, and tbh we don't use organic vinegar either, it's just what the source I copied from said.  
2 Goddamnit u/BobbyZ123! I'm a Redditor, not a dog groomer.
1 It's not for cleaning though.  My dog has allergies and she chews her paws and soap + water doesn't do enough to kill the yeast/bacteria stew on her paws which causes the itch and discomfort that results in her biting her nails and chewing her paws.
2 I wouldn't because even though the H2O2 is a low concentration it's better to not expose your pup to that stuff unless it's necessary.
2 No shit. I clearly meant he is pampered EXCEPT I don't usually brush his teeth (in fact that's exactly what I said). The main point was that he didn't have that popcorn smell before he switched to grain-free.I truly think you are delusional if you think that even close to 10% of dog owners brush their dog's teeth on a daily basis. Shit. I don't even necessarily brush **my** teeth on a daily basis, and I haven't had a cavity in over 20 years!
1 Bananas in vpajamas are coming down the stairs!
7 Yeah, this is such a big misconception about cloning.People view it as a way to make an exact copy of everything about an organism, when in reality it's just making a *genetically identical* organism, which is literally what identical twins are.
1 Thanks!
29 Wait, what's so wrong with Frito flavored...oh, oh god.
73 Instructions unclear. Baby screaming and trying to get out of the pot. 
20 How much baby does this recipe call for? This will be my first attempt at frito baby stew and I don’t want to mess it up 
12 Po-ta-to! Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew!
3 Yes, that's fine, but I would like to focus on my acting, Mr. Weathers. I did give you my last $1,100.
2 Does the baby need to be prepared first, or do you just throw it in whole?
2 I've never added baby to my stew. Do you do anything special with it first?
0 I read that as including a baby into the pot. 
1 Ah I see! Yeah my guy doesn’t bother with his paws. Poor little guys that do :(
1 Yeah, probably best to get vet advice on something like that.
1 I am actually curious about these Snuppy clones. The original Snuppy developed cancer and died at 11 I believe.    I wonder if they expect all 3 clones to develop the same cancer also. Will they all get it at the same time? Same type?

2 Instructions unclear, Baby now stoned
2 Leave the religion out of the recipe.
2 You're supposed to put the baby in head first.
11 Just keep adding babies to taste.
3 Well it depends. How many servings are you making? 6 to 8 servings should be about one average-size baby. You could use a bigger baby for more servings. 
0 Thanks for the much needed giggle at the end of a long work day.
