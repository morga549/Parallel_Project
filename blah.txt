913 By dog standards he seems quite polite.
219 This was filmed really well. I love the way the paw sneaks into the frame right at the end 
91 Better than getting those fangs I suppose
49 No please, just don't.
33 That was the most gentle "don't touch my ball" ever!
23 human: Can I have your ball?Dog: No, thank you.
19 No take. Only throw
11 Omg! The world's most polite dog!
6 My roommate’s Dog is a bit less subtle.If you go for his ball, he will lunge it with his teeth.If your hand is in the way, he will grab that as well.OUCH!
6 I'm seeing a lot of potential here to make it into the meme Hall of Fame.https://imgur.com/r/reactionpics/bF6CpFigure out a way to implement a keyboard in the mix and we have ourselves a spicy meme gif.

3 Such a gentleman, I could feel the touch by eyes
2 That's what she said.. wait.
2 Said Sam Robertson to the doctor....

2 Haha funny stuff 😂
2 That would have been a harder slap if it was Lego tape.

1 Look at this movie magic. I bet its someone else forcing his paw at the end.  /r/buzzkillington  /r/nothingeverhappens
1 It looks like a fake paw similar to Skippy the Kangaroo.
1 I love his calmness about it like he is saying "please no".
1 Fake
-4 Said no man ever.
-3 This was dumb 
-6 [deleted]
437 He's a well behaved dude full of [interesting talents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttE66jOGGpM).
13 A lot of big dogs seems to understand that they have a lot of strength and can do damage if they're careless.It's usually the little dogs that strike with all their might and malice at humans.
10 A very good boy
209 He has a great sense for composition, comedic timing, and which pocket has the treats. 
1 too many frames at the end though where the paw slips off the hand /r/gifsthatendtoolate 
0 Yeah that was the joke. 
84 Brody's attitude and sassiness are worse than his bite. 
1 Denied, ever so gently.
13 It looked a bit more polite than that.
1 And she seems smart!!
8 He's actually a Rotterman! The best of two awesome breeds. I'm definitely biased, but he's insanely intelligent.

98 Sooo when can we schedule me kidnapping this amazing dog forever 
63 Ain't got nothin on [this pup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxh-Hjj8T9o)
24 Omg is this him??? This is my favourite dog video ever. I've probably showed it to about 20 people by now 😍I LOVE his little nose snuffle after the second whisper.What a clever doggo you have!!! Can we get more pictures please? Please give him some really intense ear scritches from me ! :D 
1 Our dog can do this, although she does a little "wuf" when we ask her to whisper. But when you want her ball and you creep your hand towards it like that she will watch until you get close then grab it and bark at the same time. I've taught her bad habits like growling when she's got something in her mouth, but we know when it's play growls and know when it's not.
1 I had a great dog who would do the bark /whisper thing with a hand signal. Awesome. 
1 What kind of dog is he?

1 Golden?
1 Oh god. The fucking tail. And when you open the door and they get excited to go out. Or when for whatever reason they spook and push passed you. Or when they want to jump up on you and forget that they’re 120 pounds and maybe if you give me a heads up and some eye contact we won’t both fall down when you do that....

20 More like his marketer. He's under a no compete currently as I am his only content producer.He is compensated quite well with more scratches and leftovers than he could have previously imagined prior to his overnight fame. 
11 He was raised in a sorority house. So, he's not the most masculine of pups. 
4 That would be quite a tip for a dog gif!
